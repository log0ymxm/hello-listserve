# hello-listserve

I got picked for the listserve. I generated my email subject using the `train_network.py` and `predict_network.py` files. Additionally I looked at a few random stats on the listserve archive, most of this can be seen in the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/log0ymxm/hello-listserve/blob/master/Hello%20Listserve.ipynb), I'd definitely recommend it. The most interesting visualization is probably the topic model, check out https://cdn.rawgit.com/log0ymxm/hello-listserve/e628730e/listserve_ldavis.html and explore.
