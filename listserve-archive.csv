I had it filled until my computer restarteditself while I was sleeping. Everything I wrote gone... Like none of my thoughts happened. Would anyone care if I was a female? My age or if I was single? No it would be the words I leave behind.Treat others as you want to be treated. It can be an effortless action.Never be afraid to love unconditionally. So many fear about getting hurt but its all about the growth in our lives.Don't be afraid to step in if you see something wrongSo many times we allow evil to happen because we are afraid to step in. Evil out weightsthe good and we need more good actions in this world.We are all in each others lives for a reason. Whether it be for a day... month... or yearsSomething I wrote a while backThe universe is kind of like those revolving doors.... The one as a kid you loved to enter and keep going in a circle. If you pay close attention to when the door opens to the world... You can see the layers of what is. Sometimes you can see your past life.... Maybe another persons past life.... You will question the universe but they may not give you the answers you seek. Not to be cruel to you... Once you do see the layers... You become restless with an itch. With a small understanding even if you don't like it. LOL they say everything happens for a reason and it is true. The path is laid out for you. Its not always an easy one. Its true what they say.... When you pass its bliss just being a soul without the shell. The world is hard and cold. We are here to learn and fill a role.

January 2017,17,https://thelistservearchive.com//2017/01/17/trust/,"January 2017, 17",Trust,"Shoutout to Heather LeFevre, author of my first marketing book (Brain Surfing) that I’ve ever read.

Winning the listserve lotto could not have come at a better time.

TL;DR1. If you have a hunch to not fully open up to or trust someone, trust your instinct.2. There are people out there who won’t understand you. Don’t get too involved with those who don’t even try to.3. Don’t change for someone else- the need to change should come from yourself.4. Make sure to build a circle of good, trustworthy friends and remember to do your part on your side of the friendship.5. Hearing is not the same as listening.

Before the start of 2016, I was hurting over someone who led me on for two months.Before the start of 2017, I was hurting over someone who I thought was a good friend for a year.

It took me several months to get over what happened a bit before 2016, and I now wonder how long it’ll take me to fully get over what happened two weeks ago.The difference in pain from the two scenarios is that the first comes with an expectation of getting hurt. It comes with a burden to be cautious around that person until you can trust them enough to call them your significant other.The second scenario only comes with an expectation to drift apart, but there is hardly a burden. When you think of someone as a good friend, there’s a certain level of trust that has been built. You can easily be yourself around them and they won’t judge you for it because they’ve already accepted who you are.

It’s hard to say which pain hurts more. Although it took me nearly half a year to get over a guy I liked, the immediate pain that hit me when I saw how easily that good friend could throw away a year’s friendship over misunderstandings felt so much worse. Seeing someone bark insults while not listening to what you’re saying, and not understanding why you were as upset is something I won’t forget for a while. He’s someone who I thought I could be myself around, understood me and my flaws and still accepted me- an illusion that dissolved within a half hour debacle. I asked for a talk with the hope that he’d understand my point, only to come out with full confirmation that we were no longer going to be good friends. Today, I can’t even say we’ll be friends.

There were several red flags through the year that we talked. Repeating them now makes me scared of the fact that there are people who think this way about others, so I won’t. I’ll simply address them instead.1. People are not toys or books. You don’t discard them after you get bored or think you’ve “read through all the chapters” (I don’t even know what you could’ve possibly read about anybody considering your horrendous ability to listen to others anyway)2. Getting to know someone takes time, and when someone’s opening up to you even just a bit- grab it just by listening to what they’re saying. You can’t demand an interesting story, receive one, and then not even listen.3. Hearing how you talk about other people, including your mother, I always knew to keep my distance. Thank goodness I did.4. Some people may not be as logical as you think you are, but through all the stories you’ve ever told me, I’ve learned the difference between reasonable and logical.5. Even when you’re ranting about someone, don’t leave out parts of the story where you’ve done wrong. Admit to your own faults.6. Per the argument we had: Don’t tell anyone to change who they are Don’t tell anyone to do anything when you haven’t even tried to understand where they’re coming from  When you retell the argument to others, I wish you wouldn’t funnel the story to favor your side

After the argument, I felt like I had no more friends. He was really the only person I would talk to one-on-one regularly. Besides him, I wasn’t really active on social media and I normally wouldn’t initiate private messages unless I had some sort of business to take care of. However, as the days went on, I realized all the good I did have around me. Although we didn’t talk on a regular basis, I knew they were there when I needed them. I’ve been myself, they know my flaws, and most importantly- they listened. I never second guessed their character and what they thought of people. They’ve seen me at my worst and sometimes I would take a step back and wonder why they stay.

Many good things can come out of one bad thing if you look. I’ve grown even more of an appreciation for my friends, and learned that I need to show and mend it. I’m also now trying to kick the habit of complaining about people and things; I’ve just grown so tired of it and I want to not only be surrounded by good vibes, but also emit them.

To end this incredibly long listserve...I learned who I was and want to be. Being insulted and told you need to change by someone whom you trusted can be brutal at first. It seeps into your mind and makes you believe their words. I thought I was the shittiest person in the world with the meanest demeanor. Thankfully, as if a eureka moment, I realized I am a nice person. I have trouble communicating what I really mean, but I know I’m always considering others and I never do or say anything with mal-intent. I do have my flaws, but so does everyone else, and I can never trust someone who refuses to understand that fact.

January 2017,11,https://thelistservearchive.com//2017/01/11/explanation-2/,"January 2017, 11",Explanation #2,"I want to begin with an apology.  A few years ago I won this honor of posting some thoughts on this List.  At the end, I stated that since I’d been a therapist for almost forty years I had seen and heard almost everything, and now, as I aged, I had all the answers.  I told anyone and everyone to send me any questions about life, love or their psychological state, and I would answer them.

Within a week I had received almost six hundred questions.  Some of them were kind of fun, but many of them were serious, involving family, relationships, money, education, and even depression and abuse.

I answered about fifty of them during the next six weeks and realized I was less than 10% there. For those of you, if your still on the List, who either got some brief letter or no response at all, I sincerely apologized.

No questions this time.

Part of the problem in responding is that life is complex, so to give any kind of helpful answer to people I don’t know took a lot of explaining - if this then this, but if not this, than that.  And even that wouldn’t cover it.

So this time, I will give one answer that fits all and any questions.

If your life is difficult, as all lives are, some more than others, and you want to make a significant change, there are many things you need to consider.  You have to realize that it will take a lot of planning and a lot of practice.

Probably 92% ( a number I just decided upon) of everything we do is determined by four major forces that are constantly interacting.  The first is your genetics.  That gives you some talents, and all of your characteristics.  Genetics determine if you are tall, fat, good looking, or can run fast, can’t see well, or are dyslexic.  These things  will affect your life.  It won’t totally rule it, but it will make a difference.

Then your genetic self will be shaped and molded by the family you live in.  That family can take many shapes or forms, especially these days.  It could be you live in the Clever family, or the Brady Bunch, or maybe just with your grandmother, but you will be given a very strong impression of how the world works, and what your place is in the world, by what happens with that group, in those early years.

Next, with those genes and the beliefs and behaviors you learned from your family, you will go out into the larger world.  Your community will bounce behaviors and ideas off of you.  Some you will accept, others you will pull away from, depending upon your genetics and your family.But, look at this last U.S. election.  Most people voted the way the others in their community voted. Peer pressure? Living in a bubble?  Fear of rejection?  A mind shaped by the local truth?Yes to all of those.

Those are the three major forces that determine almost everything we think, feel and act.  But, all of that can be altered if your health goes badly.  If you get in an accident, or have a major illness, or absorb too many chemicals, or eat a terrible diet, you life will be changed. You will think and act differently.

These forces are affecting you all of your life.  These forces resist change.  They limit your options.  That’s not necessarily a bad thing.  But we all have to realize who we are, where we are, and what’s going on.  If you want to change the way you think, act and feel, you have to recognize the forces that made you the way you are.  Then you have to find ways to build new habits and practice those behaviors.  You have to be prepared for people to treat you differently, because you will be disrupting their lives too.

Or, hopefully, you can enjoy who you are, what you’ve become and whom you are with. Making small adjustments, like getting up earlier, can be easily accomplished.

Anyway.  the solstice has just passed, and we will be getting our light back; more each day. That is worth celebrating!!

There are no morals. The Universe is not moving inexorably towards any higher purpose. All meaning is man-made, so make your own and make it well. Do not treat your life as a way to pass time until you die. Do not try to 'find yourself'. You must make yourself. 

Choose what you want to be meaningful and live, create, love, hate, cry, destroy, fight and die for it. Do not let your life, your values or your actions slip easily into any mold, other than that which you create for yourself. Say with conviction, ""This is who I MADE myself!""

Do not give in to Hope. Remember that nothing you do has any significance, other than that which you imbue it. Whatever you do, do for its own sake. And when the Universe looks on you with indifference, laugh! --and shout back 'Fuck You!'

Remember that to fight meaninglessness is futile, but fight it anyways, in spite of and because of its futility. The World may be empty of meaning, but it is a blank canvas on which to paint meanings of your own.

January 2017,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2017/01/08/how-i-see-it/,"January 2017, 08",How I See It,"What I know – or think I know – is that the world is big. I have passed through at least some significant and difficult period of wrestling with the question of how to be alive, of what to do with the accident of life, and what seems clear to me is that the complexity and conflict we experience arises not from people but from circumstances. People are simple; life is hard. We’re just trying to make it from one end of life to the other and to love and be loved along the way. But, the limitations of our physical world — that make finite the resources and energy we must all consume, and that make mysterious and impenetrable the souls of others — impose upon us a labyrinth that reflects neither who we are nor what we seek.

I believe that the world is random and mostly beyond our control. I believe that birth is the inheritance of some position in a network of universal expanse that binds the fortunes of every one and every thing. I believe that advantages, like hardships, are not choices and therefore belong to no one. I believe that, across us all, the distribution of advantages and hardships lifts up and bears down unevenly, and that ultimately this jeopardizes the integrity of our whole enterprise.

This vision of mine, of the world as a multidimensional ecosystem, precipitated from a simple realization I had a few years ago. I’d been traveling, working, and living abroad for several years, and one day an obvious truth dawned on me: I had profoundly and intimately treaded into the very different lives of hundreds of people with remarkable casualness. The stupid revelation was startling for what it meant about the potential consequence and reach of my “status.”

You see, growing up in a rural town surrounded by dairy farms, under a roof upheld by a single-mother, I never got much a sense of what global currency there is in being an able-bodied/heterosexual/cis-gendered/middle-class/white/American male. And I certainly didn’t grow up thinking that I’d ever be able to touch nearly any corner of the world for no reason grander than simply, “yeah, that sounds cool; maybe I’ll live there for a year.”

Over the years, there have been many experiences that have forced me to confront the intersecting bands of my privilege, but I felt none so pointedly as this epiphany about the scope of my connection to the world.

What is clear to me now is that the ligature that emanates from my point in our kaleidoscopic mesh is not just of contact but of responsibility. That is, in my worldview, the very presence of my connection to something – be it local and immediate like my mother or distant and indirect like the climate – means that I can affect that thing (albeit and importantly, to various degrees). And, once this awareness has needled itself into my consciousness, how can I feel anything but my responsibility?

I believe all of this points to an essential kind of labor. It is the labor to see that there are vulnerable, neglected points of this web, where people suffer greatly because of how it is so jaggedly lifted and burdened. It is the labor to imagine what strain in the threads that encircle us might be allayed if we could turn the attention of our dreams to pulling and stretching smoother this fraught, tangled web. And it is the labor of committing to those dreams, no matter what massive weight they threaten or sacrifice they demand.

I believe this labor to be essential because it is how we support one another and protect the future of us. I believe in this labor more now than ever.

It may not look like it at first, but this is a math puzzle; in fact, it’s connected to some really cool (but advanced) mathematical ideas. A child could understand what this puzzle is asking, and a high school student in the process of solving this puzzle would almost certainly discover the gist of some of these ideas, whether they realise it or not.

Humans fundamentally like patterns, and our role as mathematicians is to seek out patterns that occur in the world around us, play with them to find out why they’re there, and ask questions about our findings to continue our explorations. When I mention I study math, I almost always hear some form of “I’m not a math person!” – but the picture-hanging puzzle likely piqued your interest; everyone’s fundamentally wired to be interested in finding patterns and solving problems!

Mathematics is presented to schoolchildren as a barrage of algorithms to be memorised and applied rotely and quickly. Because they get scared away by their teachers or fall off track at some point in their mathematical education, people are generally not exposed to mathematics for what it truly is. It is an art that so happens to find scientific methods handy, but the way that we teach it in schools now really is analogous to teaching art using Paint-by-Numbers kits!

As technology continues to propagate in our society, there is an increasing need for people able to think in an adept manner mathematically, yet the education systems in place worldwide continue to fail to equip students with mathematical skills outside the scope of what they need to pass their exams. On the other hand, many of my fellow mathematicians feel that understanding how to play with mathematical objects has allowed us to develop an ability to problem-solve that has been useful in many aspects of our lives.

I contend that there is a way to fix this problem, but enacting a solution may not happen during our time. In my mind, it will require teachers to be trained at a much higher mathematical level, a radical change in the way policy-makers perceive mathematics, and a willingness to open up the mathematics classroom to teach in a completely different way, one that gives students the opportunity of participating in the art of mathematics through allowing students the freedom to play with and explore whatever patterns they think are interesting. On a microcosmic classroom level, I’ve seen this work, but it will take a lot more work to see this succeed on a wider scale. In the meantime, through my teaching work, I’m going to try my best to show others the beauty of the art within mathematics.

Just for fun, here are two more puzzles which might not look mathematical but actually are:-If you remove two opposite corners of a chessboard, can you tile the remaining part of the board with dominoes?-Google “Bridges of Königsberg” and look at the first image.

SHIT HAPPENS

Rus - I've always tried to teach you & your brothers that life is never fair. The secret of life that no one tells you is this. In life, shit happens. It just does. Nobody likes negativity, so nobody says it. But it's the truth.

When you head off to university - you will not always get into the program/class/lecture that you want. After that you will not get the ultimate, perfect job. You will sometimes get reprimanded by your bosses. Yes, your wife will be awesome, but she will fight with you. Sometimes, for no reason at all and then she may even blame you for the fight. Your colleagues at work will sometimes talk behind your back and try to sabotage your career. Or maybe it just seems that way to you. But regardless - shit happens. It always does. But the good news is that NONE of it matters. And it does not even matter whether the shit happens for a reason or not. Shit does not happen in order to make your life miserable - that is just a side-effect. But it will prepare you for even harder challenges in life - and that's also a side-effect.

Any problem, big or small, in any field, at any time always comes with a lesson. Every bad experience goes away trying to teach you something. As they say - whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. This is the proverbial silver lining on the dark cloud. It will always be up to you to rise above it all and find a solution. I have already seen you do it many times before today and I am confident you can repeat this. Indefinitely and forever. Try to make sure that any lesson or experience that came with the problem was absorbed, understood and saved for later. Assess the problem with a clear head, understand why it occurred, what (if anything) you could have done to avoid it and what you did to fix it. Once it is fixed, look back. Learn what you can take from it. Know how it impacted your life, whether temporarily or permanently? Understand if there was anything you could do to ensure that it does not happen again. If it does happen again, how can you tackle it better. Look into the details since all big issues are always made up of many smaller problems. If you can do all this and come out with a lesson learned then it has become a successful problem. Try to replace the word ""problem"" with the word ""opportunity"". You will have a learning opportunity or one to solve the problem permanently.

With this philosophy, every little problem will improve your life. A failed interview prepares you to ace the next one. A betrayal today will improve your ability to judge people tomorrow. A fight with your spouse today will help prevent the next one and may even lead to more love tomorrow. Try to make the most of each problem. Life is unfair and it will keep putting hurdles in your path. The best that you can do is avoid making the same mistake twice. Remember old mistakes and and try to identify new ones. This is the best way to bring the positives out of a bad situation. It works - always has and always will.

And even if all this fails and amounts to nothing - stand proud, dust yourself off, stick your chest out, look in the mirror and put a big grin on your face. Because, out there, somewhere, someone else is having an even more shit happening to them, right now :-)

Shit Happens. Get used to it. But remember - usually it happens for good, especially if you can learn something from it.

January 2017,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2017/01/03/what-is-cinema/,"January 2017, 03",What is cinema?,"I'm a film critic and aspiring filmmaker from Barcelona, so today I want to talk about cinema. From my experience, cinema is something that everyone is familiar with as a movie goer or spectator, but only a few people really know what it IS. I'm serious: it's like there's a big secret hidden behind the screen that only real film buffs, students, filmmakers etc... can access, and that regular spectators are completely blind to. I'm not talking about HOW movies are made (technicalities...), but rather about WHAT they are or WHY they are that way. Imagine that your experience of painting or art history was that in the Renaissance they liked to paint Christian scenes and the Impressionists liked to paint people in the park (so, only stuck to the themes, the stories), rather than that the former introduced perspective and achieved perfect harmony and the latter introduced a completely different way of thinking about light (so, a knowledge related to form, to the essence of art). This is what happens with cinema.

As a film critic, I try to write about movies from the perspective of form, which means trying to understand what decisions the author took in terms of framing, composition, color, sound, camera moves, music, etc...to make his film more powerful (meaning tell his story better amor convey the feelings he's trying to convey more intensely or effectively). If you speak to any (good) filmmaker, you'll realize that these kind of questions are their main artistic concern, and this proves that here lays the key of the art of film. And this is the big secret I was telling you about: everyone loves a good movie, but no one (not even cultivated people who may know a lot about other arts, be well-read, etc...) pays attention to these questions which are the base of the artform, and they tend to disregard them as ""mere technical stuff"". It's like saying that the perspective, compositive harmony, color use, brush technique, space disposition, etc...of Da Vinci's ""Last Supper"" are all mere technicalities, and that the importance of the piece lays on the fact that it shows Jesus and his peers having their last supper.

How does someone start to discover this secret? Well, the first step is probably recognizing that no matter how many movies you've watched, you probably know nothing about cinema. The second step would maybe be to watch some of the widely considered all time masterpieces of cinema with the humility to take for granted that they are masterpieces, and that it is you who has to discover or acknowledge why. There's some books you could read, but it's probably best to stick to watching better films with better eyes. That's what I did at 14 when I started to feel that there was a secret, and it's taken me this far.

If anyone wants to discuss this, has any thoughts or questions, or needs help/recommendations or whatever to get deeper into cinema, please don't hesitate to drop me a line :).

Cheers and happy new year (I'm writing this on Dec 30) !!!

If you truly have a dream career, not just an interest in something, but a real dream, then quit what you are doing and go after it.  I did that about 6 years ago, and it has made my entire left better.

If a family member of someone you know dies, go to the wake.  Just do it, even if just for 10 minutes.  That person you know is likely going through a very tough time and it might make them feel better to see you.  Just go! Don’t make excuses, it’s the right thing to do.

If you hold a door for someone, carry an old person’s groceries, or just do a generally nice deed for someone, don’t put it on social media.  It makes being nice to people extraordinary, when it is what you’re supposed to do.

If you are feeling down or just need a pick me up, go to YouTube and search: Cochlear Implant Hearing for the First TimeHave yourself a nice happy cry, it can be therapeutic, I promise.

Knowing what you want to do in life can be a good thing, but knowing what you don’t want to do can be even more beneficial.  Keep track of things you don’t want to do and steer clear.

There are going to be times when the best thing you can say is nothing at all.  I had a huge oral argument in a case, the opposing attorney and I stepped up and the Judge immediately starting attacking the other attorney.  I had prepared for days for this and i had so much I wanted to say, but earlier I had gotten this advice from someone.  I didn’t say a word, not one.  I won and made all the partners proud.  So sometimes it's best to just keep your mouth shut!

It is important to be honest, but know your audience.  That’s why there is a term “Brutal Honesty.” Don’t be """"That Guy"""" (or """"That Gal""""). But at the same point don't ask a question you are not prepared to hear the answer to. You might not want to hear the answer """"That Guy or Gal"""" gives to """"Do I look fat in this?""""

Life is going to happen, it finds a way to creep up on us, and sometimes even trip us up.  Don’t fight it, if you are waiting for everything to be perfect in your life before you make a change, I guarantee, you will die unchanged.

There is going to be a point in your life when you have time to help others, do it, even if just for a day a year.  Helping others can make you feel better than the people you help.  I've worked with a non-profit in my spare time for a few years.  It's now a selfish act, because I feel so good when I get done.

When you boil it down, life is about the fundamentals we learned in grade school. Be nice to each other, don't be a show-off, pay attention, listen when others are speaking, set goals, take risks, and work hard.  It's kind of really that simple.

I saw this once and thought it was funny.A woman approached a Man smoking and asked him “How long have you been smoking?”The Man replied “2 packs a day for 30 years”.The Woman said """"Cigarettes cost on average $5 a pack, you’ve spent about $110,000 on cigarettes, you could have bought a Ferrari.”The Man asked “Do you smoke?”The Women said “Of course not”To which the Man said “Well where the hell is your Ferrari?”

Almost every week I go to fight with some of the loveliest people I know, using methods hundreds of years old. It's a great community full of enthusiastic, skilled people working really hard at a shared interest - researching and practicing historical european martial arts (HEMA). Some people think it's a bit rough, which it is, but it's also a great way to make friends. As I write this, I have a fair few bruises, each of which with a happy memory attached. If you're looking for a hobby I can't recommend it enough (and would be happy to put you in touch with some good places to find out more!)

December 2016,30,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/12/30/gone-batty/,"December 2016, 30",Gone batty!,"What’s your favorite animal? Mine has always been the orca whale, but really, all whales are awesome. I hoped to study whales, but I got a bit sidetracked when I found myself clutching a squeaking little brown bat two years ago while doing biology research. I realized all of the reasons I loved whales perfectly described bats as well, but I had never known bats to be anything greater than their stereotypes. In reality, bats are intelligent, incredibly social mammals. They’re highly evolved for their environments, but like whales, they don’t quite fit in at first glance. Whales are mammals in a sea of fish, and bats are mammals in a sky of birds.

But while whales get shaped into cakes (lookin' at you, Fudgie the Whale), bats are shrouded in myths of vampirism and rabidity. Additionally, while most populations of cetaceans are doing well or recovering (I say “most” because there is definitely work to do!), many bat populations around the world are declining. North American little brown bats alone are dying at unprecedented rates from a yucky fungal disease called White Nose Syndrome, which kills between 75% and 99% of each roost it hits. Remember that the devastating Black Death killed a comparatively smaller 60% of Europe’s inhabitants! Since bats are estimated to be worth up to $50 billion dollars per year to U.S. agricultural industries for their pest control services, the rapid spread of this disease is mind-bogglingly freaky for bats and the millions of humans who often unknowingly depend on them.

While we definitely should strive to protect charismatic, popular creatures like whales, so many species are struggling without a voice. How can we solve this? I wish I knew! But I invite you to think of your least favorite animal - maybe that’s a bat, a spider, a lizard, or a shark - and aim to learn a new fact about it every day for a week. What ecological services does it provide? How does it communicate? How has its species evolved? Maybe I’m too idealistic, but I think the best way to start pursuing a more rounded approach to conservation is to find ways to get excited about the animals we might not be jazzed about ordinarily because of how we've been conditioned to perceive them.

In a similar vein, I’m hoping to spend time in the near future traveling to different communities around the world (on a very low budget) that react to bats across a wide spectrum of responses -  from adoration and interest to disgust and fear. I love writing songs and making sound art, so I hope to incorporate the calls of the world’s bats into my songs to reframe them as intelligent musicians instead of gross pests. If you have any ideas of who to connect with, where to go, or anything you think might be even remotely related to this, I’d LOVE to hear them!

Thanks for reading this! Wishing you all a batty day and sending lots of hope for a better, brighter 2017.

I'm so afraid of what will happen over the next few years. I have found some comfort in doing small things - sending mail, setting aside little bits of money to be able to help people.

My wife and I belong to the United Church of Christ - we were married there 5 years ago. If you’re ever in the Miami area and want to check out a church that takes action to make the world a better place, encourages you to think and examine your beliefs, and celebrates EVERYONE, regardless of age, race, language spoken, gender identity, sexual orientation, or theistic (or non-) inclination, I invite you to visit Coral Gables Congregational United Church of Christ. (We also have a really good choir.)

If you enjoy data and details, you might be interested in being a digital volunteer. Basically, you take handwritten (or other non-machine-readable) documents and transcribe them. There are many organizations that need this – the Smithsonian is one. The documents could be diaries, archaeological excavation records, birdwatching journals, maps, sounds, old menus, or geological images. Do a search for “digital volunteer transcription” or email me.

Here’s a bit of relationship (marriage, partnership, friendship) advice*Part 1: You can endure anything for one second at a time - literally. Put your hand in a fire, step on a nail, hit yourself in the face; you can take it all for one second. Sometimes you just have to keep choosing to love your person for one second at a time, and that’s OK.Part 2: Ask for acknowledgement, even for little things, even if they are your job, even if you feel like you shouldn’t need it. Examples: “I would like to be acknowledged for putting the dishes away…cleaning up the cat vomit…being impatient in the car but not yelling at you.” Better than a gold star.   *the above advice applies only to good relationships that you WANT to be in.

Shout out to my amazing wife Cristina, the love and light of my life for the past 11 years – I love you and can’t wait for the next 60 or so (70! 80! 90! who knows?). Thank you to the Toasties on Twitter and Slack for giving me a place to rage, cry, shout in all caps, gif like the world is ending, and celebrate; to drew for being awesome and giving me Joy and Rowan; to Hillary, for trying so hard, and never stopping raising your hand. #ImStillWithHer

December 2016,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/12/24/60-seconds-start-now/,"December 2016, 24",60 Seconds Start…Now,"My name is Dev Iyer and I’m a male, 24 year old, Indian-American. I was born inside the Bible Belt town of Huntsville, Alabama. It was a magical place – full of overflowing Southern hospitality and a relaxed pace of life, juxtaposed by the clattering sounds of space shuttles being engineered within the headquarters of NASA.

As a 5 year old, I remember feeling a sense of wonder and affection when meeting a stranger. Without any preconceived stereotypes in my head, each person I met, whether young or old, black or white, foreign or American, was a tabula rasa, a blank window into a new world.

Although I didn’t know what it was at the time, I now realize what I had as a child. Not only me, but what we ALL have as children, until many of us lose it upon entering adulthood. The ancient Greeks called this “agape.”

“Agape” means “love”, but it is love that’s beyond aesthetic or romantic love. Agape is understanding, redemptive good will for all men. It’s an overflowing love that seeks nothing in return. As children we innately have this. As adults, we experience this love in 2 ways: First, we believe that people are good, deep down, regardless of what they do. Second, we find the courage to love the person who commits an evil deed, while taking action to right the wrong they committed.

In this era of technological innovation, we let Facebook news feeds re-iterate our preconceived notions, and 140-characters dictate opinion based on popularity, not logical reasoning. Our voices flutter within bubbles, echoing opinions we enjoy while discarding perspectives that are contrary to our beliefs.

Yet, despite the horrors we’re seeing online - children being massacred in Aleppo, opioid drug abuse ravaging Appalachia, climate change skeptics appointed to lead the EPA - we cannot forget what courageous free women and men can achieve when imagination is joined towards a common purpose.

With “agape” must come action. Action to fight for what we believe in, action to preserve the magnificent beauty of our world, action to cause future historians to say, “2016 was a dreadful year for humanity, but thank GOD for 2017.”

To act on this courage, sometimes all we need is 60 seconds. 60 seconds of our time to push a tiny domino.

Do you have 60 seconds right now?

Here are two initiatives making a true difference as you are reading this. Right now, take 60 seconds to act on one of them:

Save Syrian children from being massacred in airstrikes by donating $10 to the White Helmets, a civil defense group of unarmed volunteers in Syria that bravely rush into the rubble of buildings hit by airstrikes to save families.

Have a conversation with someone outside of your social media bubble by signing up for Still One Nation, an application that joins you in a video chat with two other people of different perspectives contrary to your own. (stillonenation dot org)

Whomever you are in this beautiful world, I give all my peace and love to you.

P.S. – Hey Listserv, did I mention I’m a musician that creates electronic music? I want to kickoff a new Listserv tradition by making a song for you! Go to Google and search “Philtered Soul Soundcloud” - and listen to the first track on the page. I hope it brightens your day :)

Which is odd 'cos I write for a living, and I may be quitting my dayjob in a few months, I should probably use this opportunity to promote my freelance services. Meh, I have a wife and kids and a mortgage, we're doing fine, I don't need marketing.

As a Listserve member, I never wanted to win, but if I did, I'd say, ""I have nothing to say"" and then sign off.  But someone did that a year ago.  He or she took my only good idea.

So my wife persuaded me to rerun a blog I wrote years ago.  ""What good is a baby?""  It's longer than 600 words but I don't have time to make it shorter.  Google a representative phrase if you want to read the whole thing, this will probably just get cut short ------------------------------------------------------------The title is a quote from the brilliant and influential 19th-century British scientist Michael Faraday, who after showing the Prime Minister around his lab, was asked - ""This is all very good, Mr. Faraday... but what possible use is it?""

""Mr. Prime Minister, what good is a baby?"" said the man whose work would contribute to, among many other things: the development of electric motors and generators, electrolysis, radio research, and even early insights into nanotechnology.

It's actually a fair question to ask of science - what use is all this research?  Why waste time and money to study obscure stuff like the mating habits of salamanders, or the mating habits of Neanderthals, or the mating habits of volcanoes, or the mating habits of quantum particles, or the mating habits of saturated fats, or y’know, it always seems to be mating habits with those guys, doesn’t it?

There are two problems with simply dismissing anything you don’t understand as either unimportant or frivolous - well, really there’s three, since that attitude suggests that you've lost the mental bits which separate homo sapiens from reality show hosts.

First, the media’s reporting on science ranges from pitiful to anger-inducing.  We hear about medical studies spanning decades and involving thousands of people, weighing in at 600 peer-reviewed pages or more, summarized on the nightly news as ""Hey, maybe salt isn't as bad for you as we thought, now over to Phil for the sports!""  There’s very little room for nuance, context, or even the basic point of it all sometimes.

Secondly, science is not taught very well in schools - no shocker there. Did YOU learn anything useful?

A man I worked with once described what it was like going to school in the early 1960s in the US.  Sputnik had just delivered a national shock - the USSR, then thought of as technically backward by complacent Americans fed propaganda, put a satellite into orbit in 1959, more than a year before Americans managed anything similar.

He described the level of science and mathematical education as “almost embarrassingly enriched”, with seemingly limitless funding springing from the floodgates opened by a panicking Congress.

This explains why all the science equipment I remember from the 80s was slide projectors, mimeograph machines, bakelite lab gear and textbooks from - you guessed it - the 1960s.

It's been pointed out that we're a species of idiots living in a world built by freak geniuses.  We muddle along for centuries at a stretch, placidly minding our own business, laughing at each other’s burps, until one day some peasant squats down in a muddy field and gives birth to a Gutenberg... next thing you know, we all gotta learn how to read.

Some examples of major results springing from unexpected and humble beginnings - in the 80s, an Australian astronomer had problems processing telescope data for research on dwarf stars.

He worked out a design for a chip which could perform the math to clean up the signals so he could get results - something to do with their mating habits, I’ve no doubt.

It turns out this silicon chip solved a problem that kept wireless networking super expensive, and next thing you know, wires seem old-fashioned.

Go back further - in 1945 a researcher in a postwar radar lab named Percy Spencer walks past an early magnetron tube, and notices the chocolate bar in his pocket had melted.  Guess who’s responsible for the introduction of microwave ovens 2 years later?  Yeah, the geek with a brown stain on his trousers.

As Isaac Asimov said, the most exciting phrase in science is not ""EUREKA!"" but ""Hey, that's funny...""

Billions have been squandered.  Promising careers wasted.  Valuable time lost.  Sometimes quite preventably.  Other times, by the smartest of people acting with the best of intentions.

Occasionally, great breakthroughs are achieved by dedicated folks working in their spare time, with pencil and paper, in a garage or basement.

Money and support are not always the answer, nor is their lack always the problem.  So I’m not talking about them.

Every story I can relate about serendipitous events, you can probably find 100 counter-examples, many of them tragic..

I believe the good outweighs the bad.

Here’s one: every single form of medical imaging currently in use - from X-ray to CAT scans to ultrasound - owes credit to discoveries by people who’d been mucking around in completely unrelated areas.  Not one of them arose as a result of purposeful medical research.

So if your grandma is alive today thanks to a lump someone found early (as is my wife’s), you can thank the curiosity of people who looked like they were wasting their time - and your tax money.  You don’t even have to find the right ones, since the whole point is that nobody can tell in advance whose crazy idea is going to lead somewhere.

Now, I am happily and thankfully married with the perfect lady, Suheyla who gave me a son, Kutay Mete, last spring. We were in İstanbul and after his birth we have moved to our hometown, Çorum.

She was beautiful in a retro-fringed jacket and faded jeans kind of way.

""Ever wonder what they'd say if they could talk?""

I had not, and said so but she'd moved on to look at dangling necklaces on a pewter tree. ""Everything has a story to tell. Take this locket for example. Perhaps a young unwed mother carried it next to her bosom with her newborn's photo inside, but debtors care little for nostalgia.""

I gently opened the locket and showed her the interior. ""Nice story, but it's empty.""

The shop owner waved to me from behind the counter and said, ""Your engagement ring is legit, so how much you want for it?""

""I paid quite a lot and it was only worn once, so make me an offer.""

""I can go four hundred cash, six if you want store credit. I've got some other nice jewelry...""

I shook my head. ""Let the new chump buy her jewelry. Why don't I keep looking while you help the young lady.""

The owner glanced around the tiny shop. ""Who are you talking about?""

The mysterious woman had been looking at a box of LPs by a sparsely filled coat rack, but she was gone. 

""Nevermind.""

""I'll write this up while you think about my offer."" He vanished behind a beaded curtain and left me alone with my thoughts.

""The thing about stories is when one ends, another begins.""

I pivoted and there she stood, like she'd never left.

""And how does this little story end?""

She smiled and said, ""Depends on you, of course."" She moved closer, hesitating mere inches away before sliding around and stopping in front of a locked display. ""Pick one that interests you and I'll tell you its story.""

I joined her at the case to inspect the items. Gold coins sandwiched between plexiglass, an authentic china tea set, and a host of other unremarkable items - at least to my untrained eye. I settled on a slender pen and pencil set of polished rosewood nestled in an ebony box.

""What about that writing set?""

Her lips curled slightly. ""Perceptive. Those were a gift to a handsome fraud from a childhood sweetheart blinded by love. The only time they left the box was on the couple's wedding night when she learned of his infidelity and used the pen to tearfully write a final note before ending her life.""

""I'll bet she regretted that decision.""

""Indeed. Second chances are rare, so when they appear...""

""Grab them before they're gone."" As if on cue, I heard the beads rustle and turned to the owner. ""Isn't that right?""

""Who are you talking to?""

I turned and she had disappeared. Again.

He held up a slip. ""Shall I make it out for cash or store credit?""

Like the woman had said, everything has a story to tell and my pitiful tale would soon reside in a pawn shop display case along with other abandoned treasures.Some stories deserve a better ending, I thought.. . . Leaving the shop, I felt the ebony box shift in my pocket and a cool wind caressed my cheek.

""I'd given up hope,"" I heard her say.

""You know,"" I said without turning my head. ""I never got your name.""

Faint laughter tickled my ear as I felt a ghostly arm slip into mine and sensed a new story was just beginning.

Here's a short blurb from the American RSDHope website's main page:

CRPS pain is characterized as constant, extremely intense, and out of proportion to the original injury. CRPS pain is typically accompanied by swelling, skin changes, spasms, extreme sensitivity, and can often be debilitating. It usually affects one or more of the four limbs but can occur in any part of the body and CRPS spreads in over 70% of its victims to additional areas

So if you ever have an injury that is distinctly more painful than it should be, and that pain lasts longer than it should, have your doctor look into CRPS/RSD, especially since the available treatment options' usefulness drops off cataclysmically after only a few months.

I'm just trying to raise awareness - this disease is sometimes called the 'suicide disease' as it is not intrinsically fatal - but years of unending pain that rates well over childbirth or amputation of a digit on the McGill Pain Index - and is ALWAYS ON, ALWAYS CHANGING, ALWAYS SPREADING, WITH NO END EVER IN SIGHT...

We hear a lot these days about the ‘post truth’ world.  The search for truth and understanding is as old as man, the curious animal. In the mere 200,000 years that humans have existed, ’civilized’ man has only been around for 6,000 years. 6,000 years is a lot of time to collectively wonder and discover, and to build our cultural fabric.  We can seen the evolution of this fabric when we look to the past and examine where we have come from, tools we made, art we enjoyed, music we played, food we ate and wars we fought.  These stories deliver truth to eye of the beholder, each with their own curious mind.

We search for truth in a world of uncertainty.  We are born in uncertainty as described through our understanding of the lens of quantum mechanics.  There is beauty in that view that is absolutely compelling in its ability to describe many aspects or our world.  For those that like to look towards the future, we are getting better a predicting many things or events.  However all these future events that we attempt to predict live with uncertainty. We know how long it will take for a ball to hit the ground from a given height as it is well described by physics, but the precision of measurement of that event always has a component of uncertainty.  Consider how poor we are at predicting unusual events that we might encounter as we walk home from work.  Much of that walk may seem the same everyday, but beauty will be seen in the unusual and rare, the act of kindness that you pass on is rewarded by a smile.

We are targeted everyday by those who understand and use the power of guilt, shame, fear and joy to motivate us to buy everything from deodorant, razor blades and cars to racism, hatred and intolerance. There are those that want to confound us, to make us believe, feel and react rather than think.  They tell lies and distort what we know to be true, blurring vision.  The tools of the Internet and big data are powerful and they will be applied relentlessly.  What is the social contract that we expect from each other as we use and apply these tools.  We don’t want to give up our freedom of speech, but do we not also expect some civility in telling the truth and being respectful to each other?  That is what we expect in our families, with our coworkers, business partners and friends.  There is no law for that per say, but we need to look after each other and count on each other, we have learned that much from our past.  Resilience comes from our relationships that support us, not just from pulling up our socks.  We need each other so that we can all be the best that we can be.

The deep knowledge embedded in our cultural history is there for us all to discover.  Our history is part of our truth, and there are plenty of awful periods and events in our past.  These are not to be ignored.  There is truth there to be found, it takes critical thought to decipher.  Education is important and valuable, but taking the time to stop and think to sort out the truth from fiction is essential.  This discourse is a skill and it can be learned and it is taught in our schools and universities.  Build your fabric of knowledge and wisdom, employ critical thought, be empathetic.

(From a grateful immigrant)","I’d like to dedicate this post to America. Coming here (for the second time) as an immigrant, I have been truly amazed at the opportunities that this country has given me to grow into my best self.

From an education alongside the brightest minds I’ve had the privilege of meeting, to friendships with wonderful people. From truly growing up as an individual here, and experiencing an incredibly welcoming culture, to a career I couldn’t have imagined happening — America has hurtled me forward on a path I didn’t even know I was going to pursue, and helped me find myself.

Whether it’s learning that it’s ok to fail, or learning how to jump at an opportunity to stretch outside my comfort zone — or whether it’s becoming self-confident, or understanding that being the best comes from putting together the things that you’re good at — the opportunities and lessons I’ve had in America help me grow better every day.

Most importantly, America has taught me that my identity as an immigrant does not need to be a compromise. I don’t lose my previous identity to form a new one — instead, I build on it to better myself and contribute to society.Speaking as an immigrant in uncertain times for those of us who came here with hopes and dreams, I want to say that I believe confidently that this nation has built a space where everyone can be their best self, and that we can still move forward. I’m certainly unsure, and a little bit scared and nervous about what the future holds. I don’t know how much longer I’ll be able to stay here (but I hope never to leave :)

But, this country has taught me to take things in stride. I’ll continue doing the very best I can, as a productive member of society. And I’ll hope for the best. I know that wherever I go next, America has taught me how to take what I’ve learnt and grow once more.

In the meantime, I want to say — Thank you, America, for everything. I hope we’ll have wonderful days ahead!

If you want to talk more about being an immigrant, careers, or anything at all — you can reach out to me right here!

Thanks!Arjun

sondern. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows

Here is a glimpse into this random passerby's life:

On February 28, 2015 my dear friend and Microsoft Hololens developer Mike Ey, 30, was waiting at a red light when he was struck from behind and killed by a drunken driver. The world is lessened by losing Mike. Please do not drive while impaired.

This year I attended CSS Conf 2016 in Boston. It was exceptionally well-run. The field of presenters was very diverse because the first round of submissions was blind. Candidates submitted only the content of their presentation - no personal details - and thus were chosen based on the topic's merit and not the selectors' bias. More tech conferences and companies should actively counteract bias in this way. My favorite talk was """"Coding is a Privilege"""" by Alisha Ramos. The videos and transcripts of the talks are available (for free!) on the conference website.

I love Cathy. We've known each other since October 21, 2004, started dating on March 8, 2005, and eloped in a park at 11:00 on December 13, 2014. For our one-year wedding anniversary I convinced a bunch of family, friends and coworkers to chip in and buy her a marker (or several) to complete her Copic Sketch marker collection. Everyone got to pick which colors they wanted to give, I grouped and labelled markers by giver, and then wrapped them all together in a big box. Since then, Cat has created lots of amazing art with her markers, including a set of Garbage Pail Kids artist sketch cards for Topps. You can find her art on facebook by searching for """"Razcat Draws - Work by Cat Razim.""""

In my life I've worked as a Detached Deciduous Photosynthetic Appendage Management Specialist, Production Artist / Camera Operator / Audio Mixer, Print Production Student Manager, Summer Camp Counselor, Teacher's Assistant, Summer Tech Camp Instructor, Freelance Game Developer, Graduate Assistant, Tutor, Summer Tech Camp Director, College Lecture Professor, and I am currently a Front-end Web Developer for Forbes.

I'm developing a videogame called Chain Gang Chase. It won't be finished in time for the November 2016 release date because I'm only human. It's written in Java and libGDX and the code is public on GitHub.

I love playing board games and creating puzzles. I made a puzzle for you that can be played easily from anywhere with an internet connection. Email me for the instructions. I'll think up some kind of prize for successful participants.

I want you to email me! Send me something you like. Send me a random detail about your life. Send me something happy. Send me something sad. Tell me why you believe. Tell me why you don't believe.

I want to bask in sonder.

December 2016,02,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/12/02/my-life-purpose/,"December 2016, 02",My life purpose,"Everyone is searching for the reason they were put on this planet.  What is their purpose?  I haven’t a clue what mine is.  At this age (53) I thought I would it all figured out.  I was wrong.

I think the problem is that we all believe our purpose has to be something earth shattering. My purpose in life can’t be struggling to make it day-to-day, can it?

I work two full time jobs. Animal rescue is my second job and I don’t get paid for it. The organization I volunteer with is an all-volunteer dog and cat rescue. Nobody gets paid.

We are a 501c3 charity organization, but there are no tax dollars coming in. We are not funded by the state.  All funds coming in are donations. There is never enough money to help all the animals in need and there are not enough people to help.

Before animal rescue, I was a normal person. I worked a 9 to 5 job. My evenings were my own; dinner and a movie, shopping, relaxing in front of the TV. I had weekends off; barbeques, family get-togethers, birthday parties.  Holidays off too.

I still work a 9 to 5 job, but the rest of my life is very different.  Phone calls at all hours of the day and night- animal emergencies. Weekends are now adoption shows and food drives and fundraising events. Yesterday was Thanksgiving and the first call came in at 7:00am. There are no holidays in rescue.

Sometimes I wonder, is saving dogs and cats my purpose in life?  In the back of my mind I always believed with purpose came a comfortable lifestyle (house with a heated two car garage, vacation home in the country) and a lot of money in the bank.  “Follow your passion and the money will follow”.   Animal rescue does not fit that bill.

Although volunteers are not paid in money, the gifts we receive in rescue are priceless. Rescuing an animal from certain death at high kill shelter and finding that pet a forever home brings happiness. Helping an injured dog or cat heal gives joy.  Seeing an abused animal go from being afraid all the time to trusting people again makes our hearts swell with gratitude.

I may not have a normal lifestyle, but I am not alone. My brothers and sisters in rescue live the same way.  I don’t get to see my extended family often, but I am with my rescue family almost every single day. Together we save as many homeless pets as possible.  In the past 12 years we have saved over 12,000 dogs & cats.

I am not sure if I found my purpose, but I know I have found my passion. My hope that this is emailed on GivingTuesday and that you will find it in your heart to help us save lives.  The rescue I volunteer with is Almost Home Foundation.  You can find us at Almost Home Foundation dot org.

I never feel like I have anything important to say so I'm just going to ramble and if you're cool with that or not,  drop me a note I'd love to hear what you'd have to say.

Okay, so I've been trying to write for 20+ minutes now, and I keep hating how much of a sob story that I'm writing, in an effort to give you guys something to really connect to, but I'm coming up with nothing!

So maybe, I can ask a few questions to you instead. Feel free to answer all, or one, or ask me a few of your own.1) I've been an open book and perhaps to a fault not a great secret keeper. So I'm always curious to what people want to hide. If you feel like sharing, tell me something that you've hidden from others, and why.2) What are some deal breakers you have when it comes to relationships?3) What is the best piece of advice you've heard?4) What is your favourite memory?5) What is a wacky theory that you had as a kid?6) What keeps you up at night?7) Have you ever had a moment where you felt like you were exactly where you were supposed to be? Like a checkpoint in a game.8) What do you love about yourself the most?

I knew one day I'd win this and not know what to say and maybe this email is a cop out but I think I'd be happy if one person ends up writing back to answer some of the questions.

November 2016,30,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/11/30/my-best-story/,"November 2016, 30",My Best Story,"Senior year of college I was working as a building supervisor at the University Center, a large building with tall tower. You could hear the tower striking out the quarter hour throughout the day, and sometimes a carillon of bells performing a fight song. Everyone on campus knew that this was actually a loudspeaker. And everyone including me and my friend Taylor wanted to get in there and play whatever we wanted.

Taylor had a way of making big statements and promises, and somehow backing them up. One night we got to chatting about the UC tower and its bells. He had promised everyone he knew that he would change that music, but his plan was to go up there with a hacksaw and see what he could do. I said that I had been thinking of the same, but my plan was a bit more researched.

The west stairwell under the tower had a curious locked door at the top which led up into the heart of the tower. I could pop open a keybox without any damage and get a keyring that let us navigate the locked stairwells. But the key to the curious locked door was safely tucked away inside the big vault. Conveniently enough, the combination to this vault was in the Rolodex. Doing some recon, we scurried around the darkened building and made it to the door of interest. Beyond lay the Verdin Singing Tower system, a complicated device full of lights, buttons, LCD screens, locks, and an odd MIDI card. Surely we wouldn't have to deal with all this old proprietary technology. Well, the whole thing was connected to a simple amplifier by an RCA cable. From there it went up a ladder to the loudspeakers above us. With our reconnaissance done and ideas brewing, we safely returned the keys and exited the building to make our plans.

The question was, how do you get a song to play when you want it to? We came up with a simple idea using a technology that was already available: the programmable CD player. The plan was to burn a CD with an hour of silence as track 1 and tracks 2+ as our audio program. We program track 1 to play twelve times from midnight, then our music starts at noon the next day.

The night before we got our various keys and headed up to the closet. The setup was simple. We unplugged the Singing Tower to power the CD player, plugged it into the amp, and right on the dot of midnight I pressed play.

The next morning, it might have been the chill in the air or the anticipation, but I was shivering. Taylor and a bunch of his friends gathered around the building to hear our masterpiece. Noon came and went, and I got a little worried. Had someone noticed the missing hour chimes and went to investigate? Did I mess up the programming? But just then, the first chords of Rolling Stones Paint it Black came floating down from the tower. Taylor had promised everyone he would play this and succeeded. The next two selections were mine: Another Brick in the Wall covered by Class of 99 and Blues Brothers Sweet Home Chicago. That's all the room we had for on the 72 minute CD.

The climax of the day was when on my way up the stairs a smiling girl passed me, shook her head, and said, """"Man, I love this school."""" That little bit of unsolicited school pride was the best part of the whole prank.

Now I’m afraid that we are not only regressing to old attitudes and policies towards society’s vulnerable, but entering into a time of unrecognizable hate, evil, and violence. Worldwide.

We’re in a holding pattern now until January 20th. Violence and rhetoric are up, but wait-and-seers and resisters alike have not experienced Donald Trump behind the Presidential Seal.

As of this writing the call for a recount is bubbling up. Who knows, maybe a Hillary Clinton resurgence is in order. But I am not a wait-and-seer. I’m stirred to resist. I hope you are too. We can look to history and learn about what’s brewing, and we can look to history and learn about those who resisted.

Ultimately this is brand new and unpredictable, and so our resistance must be, too. Remember that in times like these revolutionary love and art rise up. After all, “worrying is like praying for what you don’t want.” Don't worry! The election may be over but the vote is still out. Not at your polling place, but in your community. You can still cast your vote for how you want the world to be. Speak out, be heard, make new friends.

No matter the darkness, no matter the hate, I believe we are all endowed with simple, lighthearted purity. Once a day I turn focus inward and remind myself of this with a popular Hebrew adage. Elohai neshama shenatata bi, t’horah hi. My God, the soul you have placed in me: it. is. pure.

However, quitting a high-paying job, moving halfway across the world and looking for another suitable job in a completely unknown country is difficult, maybe even at times frustrating.

November 2016,26,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/11/26/tenants-and-landlords/,"November 2016, 26",Tenants and Landlords,"On a late summer day in 2009, I reported for my first shift as a hotline counselor at a tenants' rights organization in Chicago.  I had volunteered to answer calls from tenants who were uncertain about their rights, many of whom were on the brink of losing their homes.

My first caller was a single mother of two who lived paycheck to paycheck and had been living in conditions most of us couldn't imagine.  Her bathroom ceiling was leaking and covered with mold, until one day it started to fall down.  A chunk of plaster narrowly missed her two-year-old daughter in the bathtub.  She called her landlord, who did nothing.  Then, her power went out.  The landlord hadn't paid the electric bill, and he ignored her calls.  To get her lights back on, the tenant joined together with her neighbors to pay the massive past-due electric bill, and deducted the cost from her rent.

It was then that the landlord acted.  Not to make repairs, but to promptly bring the tenant to """"eviction court"""" for the rent she withheld.  Suddenly, this tenant, who had already endured so much, was at risk of losing everything:  the roof over her head; the only home she could afford.  The landlord, meanwhile, faced virtually no punishment for abandoning his tenants.  At the center of this tenant's crisis is the fact that she would likely have to go to court without the help of a lawyer.  Studies have shown that roughly 98% of landlords have lawyers in housing court, while in many cities, fewer than 5% of tenants have counsel, making it nearly impossible to assert their rights.

To this day, I don't know if the tenant got a lawyer, whether she won her eviction case, or whether her landlord ever fixed the gaping hole in her ceiling.  I know so little about her, yet she impacted my life in such powerful ways.  Her story motivated me to keep volunteering on the hotline, and inspired me to become a tenants' rights lawyer so that people like her have a fighting chance against abusive landlords.

Today, I'm a lawyer at a nonprofit in Brooklyn, representing tenants against landlords who are harassing them, discriminating against them, and refusing to make repairs.  The balance of power between tenants and landlords is as infuriating as ever, and sometimes I'm left feeling hopeless.  A tenant who misses just one rent payment can be at the brink of losing her home in less than a month.  But when a landlord breaks his end of the bargain, it often takes years for tenants to get justice---if they ever do.

At the same time, I'm on the upside of another great imbalance.  When I'm talking to a tenant living in unlivable conditions, I think of my own cozy apartment and sing Brett Dennen lyrics in my head:  """"In a world of suffering, why should I be so blessed?""""  There is no answer to that question.  But I strive every day to pay back my blessings.

Three other things:1) Shoutout to the Metropolitan Tenants' Organization in Chicago, where I volunteered on the hotline, and Brooklyn Legal Services Corporation A, where I work now.  They're great orgs, donate to them if you can! 2) Volunteering has changed my life for the better, and it's a great way to connect meaningfully with other people.  In my city, New York Cares and NYC Service are great ways to find volunteer opportunities; worldwide, the website Idealist is a great resource.3) Email me if you're in/near NYC and want to get a drink.

November 2016,25,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/11/25/how-to-save-a-life-today/,"November 2016, 25",How to save a life today,"My grandfather is a Holocaust survivor. When I was eighteen, he brought my family to Poland and walked us through his childhood history. In incredible detail, he narrated the scenes of his youth: the aroma of bagels wafting from the corner bakery; the warm glow of candles filling the living room on Friday nights; the Nazi guards barking “Schnell!” as they herded Jews into cattle cars; the mad flight from the death march, starving, freezing, hunted. He described his mother, who meticulously prepared the house for Sabbath. His father, who dreamed of sending his son to Europe’s greatest yeshiva. Everyone he knew was killed. As we stood in the heart of the Auschwitz memorial, a death camp stretching as far as they eye can see, my grandfather implored us with grieving urgency. Honor their memories. Build a better world.

There are so many tragedies that prevent us from realizing the world my grandfather dreams of. More than 20,000 children will die today from preventable causes such as malaria and diarrhea, a silent, ongoing disaster that will never make headlines but merits alarm as great as any crisis we’ve seen. It often feels like this is just one of a paralyzing array of global problems we are powerless to change.

Except that’s nonsense. You, the moment after you read this email, will change it. To do so, we need to move past the urge to post angrily on Facebook and stop there, or to give to the charity that makes us feel good rather than the one that truly solves a problem for someone in great need. We need to act, and we need to act smartly.

A movement called Effective Altruism has been studying exactly how to do the most good in the world. They’ve found that anti-malaria bednets are among the most powerful tools; just a few thousand dollars spent distributing bednets will save a life (follow GiveWell.org for amazing charity research). We also need to stand against hatred and change the systems that perpetuate poverty and conflict – but we can take a tremendous first step by eliminating the easily preventable diseases that rob so many families of their loved ones, day after day.

Imagine if, one day, you walked by a burning building and heard someone crying for help inside. Imagine dashing in and lifting them out of the rubble to safety. That would be an incredible experience – maybe the best day of your life.

You don’t need to walk by a burning building to save a life. You can do it right now. If every person reading this email donates $10 to Against Malaria Foundation (againstmalaria.com/donate.aspx), we could save 60 lives. If you donate, email me at  with the subject “Donated: [amount]” and I’ll let you know how many families we helped, together.

In 1943, the world watched silently as my family burned. In 2016, let’s not be silent. My grandfather is still around, and I’ll let him know how much we gave today. I know you’ll make him proud.

I joined The Listserve in April 2012 before the first message was even sent.  I see people get their chance as soon as a day or two after joining, while I waited and wondered if I would ever be chosen as the list grew to over 21,000 (21,969 as of this writing.)

I thought about that and was going to write a message so I could have it ready.  I really should have done that then write this shortly before deadline.

I was considering writing something about…

... being unemployed and trying to find work. (If you got a good lead in the Sacramento area or something I could do online, please feel free to contact me at the email at the end.)

… being a Furry. (Fans of Anthropomorphic Animals. I am a Moger. Moose/Tiger Hybrid)

… how I met my Canadian Boyfriend. (He is AWESOME!)

… how (years before the election) I was looking into dual US/Canada citizenship, and then found a site in Canada that mentioned since one of my parents is Canadian, I might already be!!!! (Google “Am I Canadian?” and a site from the cic.gc.ca should show up)

… how you might not think college is worth it, however, lots of recruiters use the lack of a college diploma as a tool to weed out people applying for a job.  They might have a stack of 100 people for one job, so they put them into two stacks, those with a diploma and those without. Then they take the ones without a diploma and immediately reject them.  This has happened to me numerous times, and I have had recruiters/HR people tell me that is the way they narrow how many people they have to look at.  Stay in school and get that college diploma!

… how awesome Mtn Dew LiveWire is! It is “DEW sparked with Natural and Artificial Orange Flavor.”  In the words of Ferris Bueller, “It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.”

… how some of my favorite quotes are in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, such as “Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in awhile, you could miss it.”

… how Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure also has some great quotes, such as, “Be excellent to each other!”

… how my Amazon WishList is rather unfocused as I have many interests from “Moose Farkel” to “HP PowerUp Backpack” and everything in between.

… how I was one of the first (if not the first) full-time professional video game testers back in the first wave of home video games (late 70s-early 80s)

... how to use Google Search and find almost anything.

… Oingo Boingo.

… You.

… how I wish Ellen DeGeneres would give me a car. So, I do wish she would and I do enter any contests of her’s that give away cars, however, I would be much happier being employed again so I can buy my own. =)

… winning The Listserve like “You will be chosen soon!” (OK, so now I have done just that.)

However, I am hitting up against the 600 word limit so I will just say, “ Hi “ and go back to waiting to be chosen again… please… so I can have a bit more time to figure out what I am going to write. =)

Hoof a moose excellent day!

When I honeymooned in Greece, one-week after my wedding, my wife and I were participating in one of those sunset cruise tours and were swimming off the coast of Santorini. Foolishly, I had my ill-fitting wedding band on - a ring, that while having an insignificant monetary value, had been my grandfathers, and in the family for 60 years.

Aggressively paddling along, some 20 ft. (6.5M) from the coast (also a bit drunk), the ring slipped off and begin to plunge to the bottom of the jade green sea. I dove into the densely-salted water, eyes-stinging, frantically scanning for the thin gold band. The weight of the sudden implications of losing this ring, coupled with the superstitional significance of this happening one week to my wedding day, brought a level of fear to me unfelt in nearly 36 years of life.

I couldn't see it, couldn't find it.

Nearby, a fellow passenger on the tour saw me frantically pop up and shout to my not-nearby wife the situation at hand. He quickly dove into the water near me; I felt his motions underneath my treading and, in a scene reminiscent of a popular Tolkien novel, he ascended hand first through the emerald surface, gold ring in fingers.

People describe miracles as something that can only be designed by God, given to us through a favored intervention. When you don't believe in God, like I don't, it's easier to see that miracles are those rare moments in which luck beds circumstance and we have the sudden offspring of a moment of humanity, shining brighter than a star and blinding us, if only for a moment, from the ill and foul of our daily reality.

We’re capable of miracles, every day, and so are the people around you. But, don’t wait for a stupendous moment – recognize the miracles along the way and savor these as your reward for life; I, for one, am not trying to live a good moral life because I think there’s some cloud and lute laden landscape out there…

I’d like to think, generally, we’re a good species and that we want to make miracles. That evil isn’t inherent and the ill and the foul that often envelops us makes us do the dumb, selfish things. I know this instinct, this feeling: it’s easy to embrace it and indulge in dumb and selfish. But, I’m trying Ringo. I’m trying real hard to be the shepherd.

Finally, for those of us in the USA like myself, who might empathize with my political leanings, looking for and trying to make miracles might be something we want to strive for, particularly in the days ahead. Thanks for reading.

I have little in common with some of these people, yet we can come together over our shared delight in watching little goats jump around and munch on plants.

3. Grief can make you strongerSix months ago, one of my goats died suddenly. He had always been a very curious fellow - jumping over fences and once escaping into the street. Curiosity would be his tragic flaw; one day he chewed through an electrical wire that we thought had been well secured. I felt as if my heart had been ripped out. I loved him so much and did everything I could to give him a good life, but ultimately it wasn’t enough. I’ve emerged from mourning a stronger person. I have a renewed understanding that we should fight like hell to change the things we can control, without feeling helpless over the things we can’t.

I’m a bit of elsewhere in America, an immigrant woman from the Old World, and a sexual assault survivor who unpacked her past online in a bid to make people think before they voted, since I couldn’t vote as a resident alien.

I’m also the granddaughter of a man who had to leave his country, seek refuge in another, and spent WWII as a POW in Nazi forced labor camps.

This man taught me the importance of building bridges to ensure history doesn’t repeat itself.

As a result, I’m a journalist with a degree in German.

I also left my birth country—the country that took my grandfather in and made him a citizen—as soon as I could because I never felt at home there.

The reason? An Eastern European last name that made me stick out like a sore thumb, made me “other”.

Until Nov 8, that country was my personal Voldemort.

On Nov 9, I realized I could still vote in the upcoming election there as long as I faced the admin monster, set my feelings aside, and apologized for not caring enough to vote since 1995.

Because what’s happening on a global level is bigger than me.

It’s bigger than all of us.

We’re staring fascism in the face on both sides of the Atlantic.

America’s burden is France’s perfect storm: A country that has lived in fear under a state of emergency for a whole year after a slew of terror attacks could soon elect its first female president, aka the leader of the National Front.

If that happens, the country where the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was signed in 1948 is going to become even more of a living hell for anyone not white and/or not Christian, mirroring the situation in the US.

In short, we’ll end up with a new world order.

While America faces an uncertain four years unless the Electoral College fulfills its purpose next month—which is unlikely as there’s no historical precedent, but then again this situation is unprecedented—France can still push back against right-wing populism as it did in the 2002 presidential elections.

It’s no small thing: by pushing back against the far-right, France would not only defend the republic, but also uphold stability in the EU and in the Western World.

In America, the only way we’re going to get through the next four years is by being vigilant and systematically calling out every single instance of discrimination and oppression as and when we witness it.

Using our voices, our words, and our shared humanity, we can create the America we thought we were, the America the rest of the world used to look up to.

It’s my duty as a human to do all I can to make this happen, both personally and professionally—please get in touch if you need writing/reporting/editing/foreign media monitoring, or if I can help you with words in general.

Distraught? Me too. Write me, let’s cheer each other up!

With 2016 coming to an end, I have been reflecting. I have grown so much this past year, and for me the most important thing I discovered was that true love really does exist. I do not believe in much, but I do believe in this. I believe in that, 'we only get one' kind of love. A love so strong that NOTHING can break it. A love so strong that you don't need to believe in anything else, because that love is all you need, ever.It took years of unhappiness, separation and even divorce for us to realize, that we were the only ones for each other. He and I met when I was 18, just out of High School. We were together for 12 years. Married for 7. We made 3 beautiful children together. We had the happiest of times and eventually the worst of times. We fell apart, but ultimately came back together. Today, we are stronger than ever. Love is alive and well in our part of the world....and I hope the same for you!!!

To anyone missing someone, I hope they're missing you!To anyone who is hurting, it really will get better :)To anyone alone, I hope love finds you soon.And to all the haters, Love Always Wins!

A little about me; I am a Mom of 2 young boys ages 8 & 4. They're the highlight of my day, every single day. I had a little girl who passed away when she was born. My ex husband is now my domestic partner, LOL...but, I am not sure how I feel about marriage in the future. We were married and it did not work, now we're together and happier than ever so I do not feel the need to solidify that on paper. I work full time as an ap/ar specialist for a small financial firm, and right now I am watching Shameless while composing this email. I just started it, I'm on the 4th episode of the 1st season and it's pretty good! 😊

The intended trip with friends to Petra for the day wasn't well planned, so I explored the beach town of Aqaba solo instead. I walked quite a bit, and when it came to cross back to Eilat, Israel I was far along north on the road, and chose to continue walking instead of taking another cab.

Though perfectly legal to cross, Jordan is considered unsafe and there are still tensions among the people of the bordering countries. The Hebrew-marked print of my water bottle had to come off, I figured it would be safer. I continued walking the sandy dirt along the single road to the border crossing, now almost in sight.

The afternoon heat was scorching. A man in uniform whistled at me at the military outpost on the side of the road. A small shack, a tower, and a few Humvees were all it was. I pointed in the direction of the border, trying to indicate to the man I wished to continue ahead. I barely had time to turn my head and take a step before he whistled again, this time shaking a finger.

I quickly thought of the contents in my backpack. An English book from a friend, a small collection of shells, an unmarked water bottle, a jacket, and 3 passports. Walking toward the outpost, I realized this may not go over well. Some trouble was looming: being detained, jail, or worse.

I said ""hello,"" and the man pointed at a white plastic lawn chair: ""sit,"" indicating to place my backpack on the side. ""Passport."" I fumbled through the front pocket where 3 passports sat together, weighing my options. The choice was easy, but I couldn't have him know of the others. USA relations to Jordan are not quite friendly. Being Israeli or Jewish may have been quickly disastrous. I pulled the crisp red covered booklet - I was now Romanian.

""Jacob?"" It wasn't quite my name but I said ""Yes, yes"" to get it going. ""Where you going?"" I explained I was headed to Eilat to take flight home to Romania. It wasn't quite true, but my best story out. ""You wait here.""A minute later he returned with a ceramic mug, ""Fire tea?"" We both sat and enjoyed the spiciest hot ""Fire tea"" I've ever had. It was delicious. ""Cigarette?"" ""Sure."" I don't normally smoke, but I had to appease the situation. Two men a short distance away were removing their bulletproof vests and used them as a prayer mat to Mecca. The irony of the situation was much.

""You wait here."" Ten minutes passed, and eventually an old Toyota pickup passed by. I was nervous to what will come next. The man whistled again and the truck came to a screeching stop, and reversed to the station. The men exchanged a few words in Arabic, and told me to hop in. They drove me to the border, dropped me off, and I walked across.

I work for a nonprofit that consumes a lot of my energy, but which I believe in to my core. Foundation Center's mission is to build the capacity of mission-driven people and organizations worldwide, so that they can improve communities in smarter, more connected ways. It's basically a meta-nonprofit -- one that exists to support other nonprofits. Most of our resources are free and data-driven, and most of my colleagues are the most delightful, passionate, and kind nerds---simply the best people! If you're in the nonprofit sector or know people who are, check us out and spread the word.

I'm currently in Geneva on a work trip. I'm stressed by this final week before the American election and the way the news here reflects our political shenanigans. Multiple people have asked me with deep concern why and how we let Donald Trump get so far. I tell them I don't know, and that it's terrifying that one of our presidential candidates is also our biggest punchline and fear. If you're reading this and are able to vote in the US, do not ignore this responsibility! GO VOTE on Tuesday. Hillary Clinton is not perfect, and neither has been any candidate ever. But she's good. Really good. And, she has a lot of smart people around her who understand the responsibility and complexity of leading the country; voting for her is voting for a team of brilliant leaders. We can't assume she'll win (how bout the Cubs, eh?), and need to act to make sure the wrong person isn't elected.

November 2016,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/11/05/good-fortune-hard-work/,"November 2016, 05","Good Fortune, Hard Work","This is a treat.

My invitation to write for the Listserve comes at a time in my life I have much to talk about.  2016.  This is really a sharing of joy.

2016 has been a year focused on family building and foundation building.  For the past 3 years, since I quit my last job to pursue software development, my path has been on a trajectory that I've set for myself rather than being a passenger in the general flow of time.

I wanted to get into software development for a number of reasons.  It's fun to build something.  It's a career that I might eventually be able to do remotely, giving me locational freedom.  It's full of rich and complex problems, as well as more straightforward problems that give your brain a break but still seem like magic at times.  

2013, March, I quit my job and do a 9 week bootcamp.

2013, June, I find my new place, at TWG in Toronto. (Good fortune and good friends brought me to the place, and I've continued to find good fortune and good friends here as well.)

2015, March, I proposed to my girlfriend.  She said yes.

2015, July, we decided to try for our first child instead of waiting for our marriage which we set for 2016.  (The mind was willing to wait, but our bodies were starting to feel the quiet anxiety of the passage of time and wanted to have at least 2 children if we could.  Or give ourselves the best chance at it with as few complications.)

2016, March, our son is born into the world 2 weeks early. Eager to explore.

2016, August - September, I took parental leave in order to spend some time with my developing child.  An amazing 2 months of my life, rounded off with our wedding in September.  An amazing day spent with an amazing woman and child.  And family.  And friends.

2016, October, I talk with my company about working remotely and they said there's no problem doing so.

We're planning, now, to move out of the city a ways so we can have a home in which to raise our budding family.  We could do so in Toronto, but not in the same way.

I'm just happy and want to share that happiness.   2016 has been a good year.  They won't all be like this, but with the family forming around me as my wife and I work towards that future, we'll keep striving for stability and joy, exploration and happiness.  We'll try.  We'll see where the chips fall and how the dice lands.  We'll see what our efforts produce, too.

I hope, as 2016 rounds out for all of you, that you have some good stories in 2016 yourselves.

I wasn't sure what to share on here, but the joy I'm feeling felt like a good thing to try and share.

November 2016,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/11/04/the-power-of-movement/,"November 2016, 04",The Power of Movement,"I began running many years ago as an attempt to lose weight.  It worked, but it also opened up a new world for me into the power of movement.  My love for running has grown over the years, so much so that it has become a focus of reading and research into what I hope will become books and/or writings in the future.     It started out so simply, with me trying every week to run continuously just a quarter of a mile more than I had done the previous week.  It added up quickly.  From there, I began to find out more about accomplished marathoners and ultrarunners, then spiritual runners, such as the Marathon Monks of Mt. Hiei.  I found works that told of the legend of Pheidippides, running from Marathon to Athens, and how inspired such a run would have to be to do so until your last breath.  I read of the Tarahumara.  I found Joseph Campbell’s writings and lectures beyond """"The Hero with a Thousand Faces"""" and it changed my perspective on life and how I/we live it.  I found works about “induced movement,” practiced by such people as Thoreau, Baudelaire, and Huxley, to name a few.  Great minds of history have been known to jumpstart their research and philosophical quests by taking a walk or run during the day, some with the assistance of narcotics and/or opiates (an experience I highly recommend, no pun intended).     The power of Nature and the outside world, in my humble opinion, cannot be denied.  Through running and hiking, I have found solace, healing, creativity, new insights, original ideas, plots for books, meditation, personal realizations, strength, and self-discipline.  There are studies which show the positive effects of movement on all sorts of psychological disorders, from children with behavior disorders to soldiers returning from war.  Movement as therapy is a practice too long ignored.     My hope is that all of us around the world get up and move more, especially in the great outdoors.  Our national parks, green spaces, and wilderness areas are where we truly find ourselves by leaving the modern world behind and seeing what we are capable of.  It is a mentally healing practice and its therapeutic benefits cannot be denied.     My wife and I are embarking on our own walking adventure next year; we will be quitting our four collective jobs to hike the Appalachian Trail.  We are both excited and terrified for various reasons.  We have been planning and saving for about three years.  We have no children, no debt to speak of, older cars, no mortgage, and have begun to pare down our possessions, all with the intent of starting over on the trail and after, when we will move to a new location and begin a new life.  Sure, it’ll take a 2,000-mile trek to do it, but if you want to get somewhere new, you have to be willing to take the first steps.     I hope all of you who take the time to read this are already lovers of the outdoors or that you choose in the future to get out more.  Find your own hike, take your own steps, and I think you will be amazed at where you end up and who you become.

     Here’s to your first or next steps, all of you!

November 2016,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/11/03/a-canon-of-cannons/,"November 2016, 03",A Canon of Cannons,"""The Anecdote:

It is a perverse moment during international conflicts when domestic structures are disassembled for a state’s own munitions. The year 1789 witnessed the melting of the bells of Notre Dame to make cannon. After the 1939 World’s Fair in New York, the iconic Trylon and Perisphere were deconstructed for the production of WWII armaments. Endless quantities of architectural ornamentation across the Allied Powers were removed in the 1940’s for war efforts. These acts embody such a simple twist: take a stand by taking something that stands. It is as if the built manifestation of a people’s ideals transform into invisible artillery for the preservation of its underlying ideologies -- as if the crystallized structures have all along been peaceful arms preserving an identity against other cultures.

I like to study how our environment tells stories about not only its inhabitants, but its creators, its viewers, and its inheritors. I believe the permanence and slow pace of building holds a mirror to the rapid and continuous unfolding of our current affairs. Never static, our built environment continuously changes even when its physical stature seems fixed; from initial conception and construction to interpretation and patina (and sometimes destruction), what surrounds us shifts with us. In other words, what goes up around us changes much more than we think.

The Experiment:

In light of this, I’d like to run a small experiment. I run an online project called “Empty Canon” that assembles architectural projects -- some hypothetical, some real, some offensive, some banal -- and continuously reorganizes to reflect our changing interpretations. I’d like to add a special section for The Listserve!

What’s the most interesting building you’ve ever seen? If you send me a name and/or image of a building in the world around you (and architect if you know her/him) I will add it to the Empty Canon index (with your credit, of course). The results will be tracked in a special area for The Listserve to follow. Send me your tired, your poor, your colossal, your small, your overwhelming, your extravagant, your functional…

And finally, I would be remiss if I didn’t thank my love, Emily, who introduced me to The Listserve.

I highly suggest everyone give diving a shot, at least once. I'm glad I did. 

I've never been a water person. When I was younger, my older sister was an avid swimmer. She was good at it. As all younger siblings do, I wanted to be just like her. I asked my mother to enroll me in the swim club, too.  

I just wasn't made for the water. It was cold, I couldn't touch the bottom of the pool, and I hated getting it up my nose. After my first practice, the club coach told my mom that """"maybe I should try other sports"""". In many cases, this would be deflating. Can't say I was mad in the least bit: with every mouthful of water I spit out, I knew she was right. I quit, and built my adolescent years around other (land) sports.  

Fast forward to every beach trip ever through age 18, and I still hated water. I hated how big the ocean waves were. I watched my sister get pinched by crabs 3 times (each time, she went digging for them, so she asked for it). Also, in the mid-Atlantic area, I couldn't ever see what I was sharing my space with. Risk salt in my nose and possibly step on sea life? No thanks. 

Just after college, I explored some southeast Asian countries with a friend of mine. We ended up having more days in Thailand than anticipated, so we took the extra time to get all the way out to Ko Tao. Ko Tao, Thailand, is a small island known for turning out new PADI certified divers in troves (and for being beautiful!). Diving in the area is quality and super convenient. 

Knowing my aversion to water, I assumed I'd spend my time on the beach. However, one thing I'm really good at doing is committing to things I'm fundamentally opposed to before I really think them through, so naturally, I agreed to try diving. 

Through a PADI program called DSD, Discover Scuba Diving, uncertified divers can give the sea a whirl under the close supervision of a dive master. 

I signed up for the course. 

We got in the boat, put on the equipment, and jumped in. I didn't even panic throughout the introductory lesson. 

However, I did begin to panic the first few times I was submerged. I'll admit, it was unsettling. You can feel out of control of the situation at first: once you're under water, you can't just shoot up to the surface if you feel panicked. Also, your breathing is controlled through a regulator, which feels strange. No massive, quick breaths-- you know, the kind you want to take when you're panicking. It's incredibly uncomfortable and unnatural at first, and is almost distracting.

But then you look around: You see rays glide over the sand, and eels peek out of their rocks. You see coral that hides away at your movement, and sneaks back out as you wait. You swim through massive schools of fish, light reflecting off of their scales like glitter. You notice the rhythmic sway of the shark's tale as it swims slowly, peacefully past you. You feel weightless, and surprisingly, careless. 

The ocean is an incredible world. It took me a few days to get over the parts that felt unnatural, but I realized I wanted to see it again. Despite my innate aversion to water,  I ended up getting diving certified in Ko Tao.

Give yourself the opportunity to get lost in some of the most peaceful, beautiful moments you could ever experience. It's incomparable to anything else on earth.

Some other musings:

Tuesday is a great reason for the good wine.

Pets are wonderful family members. Save a life, adopt.

One of my favorite foods is from a local burger joint. It's a bacon, egg and cheese burger-- on a grilled doughnut. Sweet, salty, and highly recommended. If your cholesterol will tolerate it, make your own version. 

 I love to travel, and would be happy to hear about your favorite places to visit-- particularly in Sonoma or Napa. Or your favorite diving locations.

I was no longer facing the busyness of clinic, the exhaustion of long surgeries, nor the hoops through which to jump for the next accreditation. I had free time to expend however I pleased. And within this newly-created space – the space to which I had looked forward for countless harried years - I unexpectedly discovered a deep pain. It turned out to simply be the pain of being alone with myself.

Through a serendipitous recommendation, I found a place that helps a person to uncover the source of this pain, and provides tools with which to examine it. And working through this pain, I was surprised at what I found on the other side.

I don’t have the word count, nor your attention span, to talk about where I went, the amazing folks with whom I travelled, and the many lessons learned. But I share below what I feel to be its essence:

Distraction & Judgment = Disconnection.

We spend an extraordinary amount of effort creating boundaries. To separate you from me. Us from them. Here from wherever else we’d rather be. It is easier to disconnect – to judge the “now” and be distracted by the “better” – than to be present. Although not new, with the help of our current technological landscape, this issue is at epidemic proportions. We are hiding from life and, thus, from being human.

Presence & Compassion = Connection (& Love).

With the simple act of being present with whatever is going on around us, we begin to slowly emerge from our safe and dark non-realities. By seeing another as a fellow flawed human – not writing them off with judgment or categorization – we re-discover vital connection through compassion. By cultivating presence with our full range of human emotion, we cultivate critical self-understanding, self-compassion, and self-love. We thus neither crave, nor grasp, nor resist. We simply live.

I am far from the perfect embodiment of these principles. This is a starting point, from which to slowly remedy my spirit with a daily practice. The door is pried open just a crack, and I try to move it further every day.

Physicians possess a unique connection to humanity, as we are privy to moments of extreme, and entrusted to protect in these vulnerable moments.  We should embrace this mindfulness practice. Not just so we may set an example for our patients, but so we may heal ourselves. As only when we are healed, may we effectively heal others.

Instead, we are trained to be busy, and shamed for not busying ourselves. For not “multitasking”. For not taking on another project. For spending too much time with a patient, or with our families. We are effectively – surgically – trained to be disconnected.

Medical training should indeed be rigorous, and physicians should be steeped in the practice of efficiency. But a delicate balance is required, so we may best help others. I believe that the disaffection felt by the majority of physicians toward their chosen paths can be found within this paradigm.

As I begin my career, I have set an intention: to take care of myself so I may take care of others. To pay attention to myself, so I may pay attention to others. To love myself, so I may love others. And to help other physicians discover the importance of these principles. I am doing this by example, as well as by creation, through a company I have co-founded.

Thank you for listening.

Think of someone, or a group of people, who you disagree with, or get really frustrated by.

Got it?

Now take a moment to think about how they got to where they are. Why might they believe the things they do? What circumstances, environments, influences, could have brought them to where they are? How do those things differ from your own circumstances?

What could you learn from their perspective?

Most importantly: if you were in their shoes, would you believe or act any differently than they do?

-----

As someone who grew up in one (political, religious, worldview, etc) mindset, and has done nearly a 180 in terms of switching viewpoints, it can feel really painful to see people with my past views and people with my present views clash in such impersonal, attacking, and stubborn ways – because I can see myself and people I love on both sides.

I never would have become the person I am today, with the views that I have now, if I were only ever attacked for what I believed. And the people I now disagree with will never even be interested in seeing the world the way I do now if I just call them stupid or wrong for not agreeing with me. Yet I feel like that’s most of the discourse I see today – shaming people we disagree with, name-calling, writing them off.

I had no control over the setting I was born into. I did have control over the way I sought new perspectives when I got older, and the way I had conversations about topics I was curious about, and topics I became passionate about.

I’ve come to believe that everyone is a product of their environment and their genes. What I mean by that, is that if you were in someone else’s shoes, you would be the exact same person. Yes, I’m including everyone in that: from the person you disagree with, to the homeless woman on the corner, to the total asshole at the store, to Kim Kardashian, OJ Simpson, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. (yes, I realize that is a very strange list.)

I think of it as radical empathy. And it can be really hard. But whenever I remember it and take a moment to think about it, it changes the way I interact with people and think about the world.  It brings me closer to people I might normally distance myself from. I also learn more. By thinking: “what made the cult leader Jim Jones who he was?” rather than just thinking of him as crazy, I start to think about how, as fellow humans, we may be more alike than different.

I truly believe that if every single one of us thinks about the world, and our fellow humans in this way, we would be more productive in our conversations, in our solutions to problems, and in our love for each other.

So there’s my challenge for you. In writing this email, I realized I’d let my own empathy kind of fall by the wayside – so it will be my challenge today as well.

I’ve written to you all before, about two months ago, when I was leaving my Missouri home to move to Sydney, Australia. I was touched by the number of people who reached out. This is a lovely community. I’m now settled in Sydney and loving it!

(But shoutout to my city St. Louis and alma mater WashU for hosting the second presidential debate!)

Snorkel!","When I was 12, I was accused of cheating on a science test. I vehemently denied the accusation, but, truth is, I was looking at the paper next to me. I had never cheated before that, nor did I ever cheat after that. I don’t know why, but I figured telling 22,000 people would be a good way to get that off my chest, eleven years later.

I double majored in Math and Philosophy in college, but by far my favorite class I took was black and white photography. There is something unbelievably empowering about controlling the entire photo-making process from beginning to end, and working in a darkroom is, for lack of a better word, magical. As someone who never considered himself artistic, I cannot quite convey how great it felt to actually feel proud when showing others my work. I find myself missing photography a lot, and would love suggestions for how to pick it up again in NYC.

Don’t underestimate the impact just a few words can have on someone. Within the span of a few weeks, one friend told me how something I said three years ago is still positively impacting her life, and another friend told me how something I said still hurts a month later. The scary part is I barely remember saying either thing. One of my favorite TED talks is about this idea: “Everyday Leadership” by Drew Dudley. It’s 6 minutes long, and it’s one of the few things I think about every single day.

Awkward moments are only awkward if you let them be. Sometimes it’s fun to let them be.

I decided a while ago that nothing would ever be more important to me than (1) the people in my life and (2) remaining curious and adventurous. Inspired by this, I take time every day to get lunch with someone different from work. Not only have I learned so much from my colleagues during these lunches, but I also feel significantly more connected to the people I’m around and work with every day.

Data is fascinating. I work as a Business Analyst at a tech startup in NYC. Like many other companies, we are trying to improve the way that people get from A to B. The beauty in insights about human behavior and movement hidden within data is what drives me right now. I also recently joined Citi Bike (bike share system in NY), and I’ve spent more time than I’d like to admit downloading the publicly available system data and getting lost in it.

My mom is one of the most inspirational people I know, and she just released a book that I encourage everyone to read, especially those who have struggled with addiction. It’s technically a cookbook, but she shares her 20+ year struggle with an eating disorder and her journey to recovery. In the grand scheme of things, I think the recipes are a bonus. The book is called “Dancing in the Kitchen”, and my mom’s name is Colleen Duffy-Someck. Check it out if you get the chance.

Finally, I’m always looking to connect with people and share stories and ideas. If you live in NYC or ever find yourself here, I’d love to meet you and chat over a coffee or beer! And if you aren’t in New York, I’d still love to hear from you.

Shout out to the people in my life who are forces of good in the world: CH, SL, DT, TG, LP, and especially BD for introducing me to The Listserve.

Be well, and, perhaps more importantly, be good.

October 2016,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/10/29/follow-your-passions/,"October 2016, 29",Follow your passions,"Hi, everyone. I’m Sam. I could go with the cliche of, “I can’t believe I won!”, but statistically speaking, it was bound to happen at one point or another. However, it seems like the Listserve knows exactly when to drop that email in your lap: when a multitude of other important things is also happening!. For example, my girlfriend recently got into a car accident (she’s ok) and we are still dealing with those repercussions, my brother’s wedding is this week, I just voluntarily cosigned the first major debt in my life and it’s freaking me out, and the vice president of the ham radio club that my girlfriend and I belong to just resigned. And at 2 PM today is when the Listserve decides to send me an email that says, “You’ve got 48 hours to address 22,000 people!” I guess it’s a good thing that I knew this day would come eventually, and I have put some thought into what I might tell you all.

The first thing is, ham radio is still alive and well. For those of you that have never heard of amateur, or ham, radio, I encourage you to find out all that you can. And no, it’s not “just like C.B.” As a twenty nine year old, I am far below the average age of licensed hams, and I see no reason why that should be the case. There are so many different activities encompassed in ham radio, so there really is something for everyone, and so much that I could cover, but I do have a word count limit here.

There is a thriving maker movement, and hams were the original makers. Decades ago it was building from spare parts, and many still do today, but now it’s more finding ways to repurpose other items. As an example, look up RTL-SDR. It’s a $20 USB stick that originally was designed to be used as a TV receiver. Hams found a way to use it as a wide coverage receiver that allows listening to a very large chunk of frequencies. With it, you can monitor weather satellites, ham radio repeaters, public safety frequencies, and yes, even TV broadcasts.

We still provide valuable communications services in times of emergency. Right now as I type this there are emergency communications nets operating in the Hati, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida region helping to pass health and welfare traffic to and from areas affected by the hurricane.

There are two arguments I hear a lot against becoming a ham operator. “Why would I need to do that? I have a cell phone,” and “Isn’t it really expensive?” As mentioned above, cell towers can’t be relied upon in emergencies. After the storm clears, hams are able to very quickly set up temporary installations to pass communications. Beyond that, a cell phone allows you to talk to people you already know. Ham radio lets you talk to people you don’t know yet from all over the world for as long as you want without needing to pay for minutes.

As for the cost, any hobby can be expensive if you want it to be. It all depends on how much you want to spend, but getting the license is a $15 test fee, and you can pick up an entry-level Baofeng radio from Amazon for $35 with free shipping. The test is multiple choice, all of the answers are published online, and there is plenty of free study material. Even better, well established hams tend to upgrade their equipment often, so if you find a local club, someone is bound to be able to loan (or even give) you equipment. More information can be found at the Amateur Radio Relay League website (look for the ARRL on google), or ask me anything via the email below.

Don’t think that everyone who is licensed is in the technology sector. While the majority are in STEM fields, we do have a number of auto mechanics, teachers, marketing directors, dog walkers, students, librarians, construction workers, and more postal carriers than you can imagine. We come from all walks of life, and there’s always someone to talk to about more than just radio.

I could ham-vangelize for hours (and do on the regular), so I’ll move on. The second, and way more important thing, is that ham radio is what I’m passionate about, but everyone should have something that drives them forward to better themselves and the community around them. Find something you’re passionate about, and share it with as many people as you can. My best friend’s father took the time to introduce me to ham radio one day, and it changed my life in so many ways. It landed me my day job, brought me into a great community, and has given my life purpose.

If it's true that there's currently 22,082 subscribers on this thing then there's got to be people I know reading this that I don't know are reading this. There's also got to be many people I don't know that I know are reading this. Both ways: whatup people!!

One day I received a Listserve email from one ""Steve Gattuso."" I was confused. I'm ""Steve Geluso."" Why is this other name so bizarrely similar to my own? I replied and introduced myself. I found out Gattuso would soon start working in San Francisco where my buddy Joel works. Joel reads the Listserve too! Small world.

Today it is Gattuso's turn to receive an email from Geluso and perhaps be confused for a moment. I wish you the best, Gattuso!

I'm in Seattle, WA. The best city in the world. I like the crisp weather and the geography shaped by water. If you visit here you should ride a bike. In fact, I recommend you ride a bike whenever you're traveling more than 10 feet. Seriously. Without exception.

I help maintain a fun online game called Pomme. You can google for ""pomme game"" and probably find it. Go there to play a fun free image association game. It's like Apples-to-Apples, but with images. You'll love playing it. I swear. Also, I guarantee you all will break our server.

""Once, I realized a sentence had identical words appearring beside each other twice twice and decided that that was a special thing.""

I've kept a list of other examples I've seen:

""Is art art?""

""Happy happy hour!""

""Put the song on on repeat.""

""Good morning morning people!""

""to record record figures""

""to address address problems""

""to refuse refuse charges""

""I'll stay there for a while while I look for a place.""

""7:00? OK. I'll come by by then.""

""It's been something I've looked for for many years.""

""If it wasn't funny then, then it won't be funny now.""

""Unlike whiskey, you can't water water down.""

This one is not my own, yet it's a real stand-out:

""A fish and chips shop owner decides he wants his sign repainted. He tells the painter: 'I want you to put a hyphen between the words ""Fish"" and ""and"" and ""and"" and ""Chips.'""

I call these sentences ""loopdeloops."" You an see a full list of what I've collected if you copy that entire block of text quotes and google it. One result.

And our 4 year anniversary of dating. I, a daughter of traditional """"get married first"""" parents and my boyfriend decided to live in a van before continuing our studies. Our reasoning meshed well, I couldn't justify incurring double my student loan debt and I have a crazy dream of having a mobile law office. He the more environmental type, was intrigued about living small, reducing our carbon footprint, learning how to install solar panels and building out a van. 

I had never lived with someone so closely, had never lived with a boyfriend, never enjoyed having roommates, and moved far away from everything/everyone I knew. With so many new things, I now see it sounds like a disaster or multiple disasters waiting to happen.

It was rough for the first month or so as we would get into arguments over little things such as not being able to study while the other is watching something on their phone, not being able to sleep, being too cold, not putting stuff away (which is a big deal in a small space). We have gotten used to each other now, we can read each other's body language and know when something is wrong. In the end we are much closer. We don't have an assortment of 'stuff' we don't need and when we house sit it is like a mini vacation for us!

Living in a van makes you very comfortable in public spaces. I don't mind using public bathrooms or porta-potty's anymore. In fact, I have a mental list of bathrooms that are open late. We shower at the gym and get out more than we probably would if we lived in an apartment. Because of this, the van life feels bigger than the space we actually have. We study at coffee shops- feels just like a living room but bigger, sometimes our living room has a fireplace! I eat in grocery store dining areas- just like a dining room but with strangers! And I shower at the gym, which has endless soap, lotion, toilet paper- better than my old bathroom and hey, no emergency toilet paper runs!

I do realize I am very privileged to be able to choose to live this way while others do not have that option. I hope to one day help those who don't have the financial means to access our justice system an opportunity to do so. And I refuse to have to choose between paying my student loans and helping those disenfranchised. I don't want to risk my dreams being held down by debt.

In the end, our goal is to buy a plot of land, build a tiny house, and of course have plenty of animals.

My unsolicited piece of advice. I hope you say YES to those opportunities that come your way. I have always been one to always say NO because of my fear of failing, or my dread of new things and the nervousness that comes with that. I've not applied or turned down to certain jobs because I felt I wasn't qualified, I've not taken leaps to date someone because I feared rejection etc. A few years ago I started to say yes to the things that I knew would make me feel that way and I couldn't be happier. I have an amazing boyfriend (thanks to saying YES to being introduced to him), loving parents that support me in my craziness even though I thought I was disappointing them, and so many new experiences from jobs to vacations to injuries etc.

Finally if you are in the Washington Oregon border, get in contact with me so we can grab a beer or coffee. If not get in contact me anyway. Would love to hear from the Listserv!

October 2016,25,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/10/25/vote-bike-write/,"October 2016, 25","Vote, Bike, Write","Like everyone else on the listserve, I've wondered since joining what I would write about if I was ever selected. A big part of me hoped that I would never have to figure that out. 

But now it seems like it's time to rise to the occasion. 

A brief on me: I'm a 35 year old half Mexican, half Filipino non-profit executive launching a bikesharing system in Honolulu, originally from San Juan, Texas now in HNL by way of Palo Alto, and San Francisco, CA. I'm in love with Hawaii, a woman named Victoria, and Cinemas.

What I want to say1.) Please vote.This is a historic presidential election for many reasons. Even if you don't live in a swing state and you don't think your presidential selection will matter, you can almost certainly influence a local election or ballot initiative. Political governance is complicated, but our presidential choices seem stark. I suspect that the polarization driving the absurd division in our candidates at the top has a lot more to do with the success or folly of local politics than it does with federal ones. If you want change, look local. 

Just google """"register to vote"""" and you'll find instructions for every state.

I would also like to add that as Americans self governance is our Kuleana (a uniquely Hawaiian value that reflects both privilege and responsibility). I am the last person to say that voting is easy, but it's only one way to get involved. We have the ability to change the rules around us, and it's our responsibility to ensure that they work for us and for our communities. I also highly recommend checking out the work of the OG good government organization, Common Cause.

2.) Our streets are our public space, and they belong to everyone.Far more of our public space is tied up in roads and sidewalks than parks. And far more than the privileged do, the underserved need these facilities to access opportunities - jobs, services, family, care. When you are thinking about how your community does or should use these facilities think about whether your transportation is serving the most possible people or serving the best possible public use. Does that system that encourages 5 seater cars that contain only one person (or worse yet, 0 people while sitting idle 95% of the day) really make sense? Is it really using our public space efficiently and equitably or is it prioritizing the rich, the able bodied, the people who have the most? 

For more on the subject, check out the amazing Tamika Butler who does a much better job at articulating the social justice narratives inherent in transportation.

3.) Can we bring back the essay? The word essay comes from the french word """"essayer"""" which means to try. Trying to argue convincingly, trying to access a new idea, trying make sense of the world - all of these things we value, but currently find most of their expression through internet comments which we all despise. I'd love to see more of our mass communication and traditional media be structured as collections of essays, a multitude of voices thoroughly digesting the world's events and the other voices. We already have a lot of the pieces... letters to the editor, blogs, comment threads -- we're just missing the cultural expectation and practice of proper form.

I hope wherever you are, you're having an excellent day. Come visit Hawaii!

I am the host of a weekly poetry series; I'm having a good time hosting it again, after years of wondering what exactly I was doing with it. The founder of the 45 year venue died over five years ago, and I ended up being a little lost in purpose. The trouble was I was trying to be the most important person in the room. Not in terms of ego, but in terms of always making the important decisions, always knowing what to do. I was trying to build a legacy, make big decisions that seemed to be expected of me. All the while, the venue was getting a little unwelcome. I had inherited bad seeds, people who thought they were the most important people in the room (because they didn't listen to anyone else). If I wasn't catering to my ego, I certainly wasn't catering to theirs. People could come in feeling this hostility. Years of entitlement is what I ended up calling it. I came to the idea that I was irrelevant. I wanted to pass on things to people who were younger and seemed to matter more than me. That's what I thought at the time. Then I started meeting some amazing people from other venues, younger groups, other readings I attended at the urging of my girlfriend. Eventually I invited the young people at these shows to my venue as feature poets, which changed everything. This included the older audience, who didn't want to work as hard at being listened to and didn't take to this younger crowd, diverse and eager to talk about real issues. Too bad. It included some amazing new people like Jonathan J. Joseph and DiDi Delgado, and people returning to the scene after an absence like Navah the Buddaphliii (look Them up please). People boycotted, some silently, some otherwise, all went quietly away in the end. Because what were they complaining about in the end? Change? More voices? Waiting your turn? And those who did stay are loving every minute of the new sound on the open mic. With the poisonous people gone, I have no idea who is going to come through my doors anymore, or who told them to come check the place out. It's led me to my new catchphrase near the end of every spectacular show: It could be like this every night, people. All we need is you.

October 2016,23,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/10/23/the-power-of-the-mind/,"October 2016, 23",The Power of the Mind,"My story has to do with the power of the mind.  A while back I was invited to my 10- year high school reunion but couldn’t go.  They did, however give everyone the opportunity to send in a bio and updated information they then put together in a booklet.  I sent in my info and was excited to read about what everyone was up to.  I made a special note of my friend Dee Dee Barnes who, like me, had moved to the East Coast. I thought the next time I was in Washington DC I would get in touch, as I had not spoken to her since graduation.

A few months later I found myself in DC and it was a glorious day so I decided to walk back to my hotel from my appointment.  I was in Georgetown and suddenly remembered that this was where Dee Dee lived, but had not remembered to take her information with me and had no way of contacting her.  I remembered that I read somewhere that we only use 10% of our brain’s power, so as it was a day that anything seemed possible, I decided to test that theory and conjure up the unused 90% to see if I could somehow make a connection with my old friend.    As I wandered through the streets of Georgetown, I concentrated on Dee Dee and pictured her coming out of one of the beautiful brownstone buildings as I was passing.  I would say something clever like “Hi Dee Dee, I was just thinking about you”.  As an alternative, in case I was walking on the wrong block, I pictured her driving by and getting out of her car to mail a letter.  I thought about her all the way back to my hotel.  And at this point, you are probably wondering if she miraculously appeared.  Alas, no.  An experiment that did not really work, but it was a great walk anyway.

The next day, I found myself back at my desk in New York. My phone rang and I answered it.  “ Hi Maureen, this is Dee Dee Barnes”.  My jaw dropped.  To say that I was flabbergasted is an understatement.  She was in New York City and wondered if we might have lunch.  I cancelled other plans and couldn’t wait to tell her my story. Before I could get to it, she said she also got the book from the reunion and as she comes to New York often made a note to take my information.  As she was packing for her trip yesterday, suddenly a vision of me appeared in her head and she dropped what she was doing to get my number.  It was the same time that I was walking back to the hotel and using all of my brainpower on this connection.

The other odd thing was that she got directly through to me even though I had changed jobs a month before, so the number she initially called was not where I worked anymore.  Someone who knew me answered that phone and gave her my new number.  Also, my secretary usually answered my calls, but she was up getting coffee, so the call came directly to me.  There was no doubt that we were meant to talk that day.

The experience both delighted and frightened me and I realize we all have amazing powers if we channel them.  I have only tried this a couple of times and am amazed that when the mind is totally focused on a goal, it is totally achievable.  Try it for yourself.

October 2016,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/10/22/memetic-prevalence-debates/,"October 2016, 22",Memetic prevalence debates,"Once upon a time there was a Sparrow who lived with her fellow sapient animals in the woods outside of Fairbanks, Alaska. One day in October, it started to get very cold, and Sparrow's friend Salamander died of hypothermia. Sparrow was very sad about this, and said, ""This is an outrage! We need to build a bonfire and keep it going throughout the winter, so that no more animals will die of the cold!"""" 

Caribou and Bison grumbled that this would be a lot of extra unnecessary work; they'd survived many winters without a bonfire, so why was one needed now? They told Sparrow to go away and leave them alone. Sparrow, not to be deterred, started tweeting about her cause with the hashtag #BonfiresForSalamander. Eventually she got retweeted by Kitty Purry, which brought a lot more attention to her cause, and soon there was a full-blown Bonfire Movement. Animals all around the world started pitching in to help build bonfires. Before long, every animal in Fairbanks had a warm place to go. 

Sparrow was very happy about this, but she knew her job wasn't finished. ""There are still too many places out in the wilderness where animals aren't safe from the cold!"""", she said to her 400,000 Twitter followers. ""Last week, an entire family of frogs died near Yakutsk. We have to keep building bonfires everywhere in the world, until this never happens again!"""" 

Meanwhile, outside of Phoenix, Arizona, a Coyote woke up and noticed that it had gotten much hotter than usual. She crawled outside her den and saw that the other animals had built a bonfire just outside it. 

""Hey, what's going on?"""" she asked Iguana and Gila Monster as they gathered more dead brush to throw onto the bonfire. ""Why is there a bonfire outside my den? It's way too hot in there now!"""" 

""We're building bonfires to keep the other animals safe from the cold. Haven't you read about it on Twitter? It's a movement!"""" said Iguana. 

""That's my den and I'm worried I'll get heatstroke! Can't you move it someplace else?"""" said Coyote. 

""Look,"""" said Gila Monster, ""I know this is inconvenient for you, but the Bonfire Movement is really important. Cold weather is the worst crisis of our time, and it kills millions of vulnerable animals every year. If you don't support the Bonfire Movement, you're on the wrong side of history and you deserve whatever you get."""" 

Frustrated, Coyote logged onto Twitter and wrote: ""@Sparrow In Phoenix it's really hot and there are too many bonfires. Can u guys maybe stop building them there so I don't die of heatstroke?"""" 

Sparrow replied: ""@Coyote Cold is a much bigger problem that affects more animals than heat. I've never seen anyone get heatstroke #BonfiresForSalamander"""" 

In desperation, Coyote moved to Yakutsk, which was cold and unpleasant, but at least there weren't any bonfires. Turns out not a lot of people there follow Kitty Purry. Today, there's a thriving Anti-Bonfire Movement there, made of other animals who moved from equatorial climates. The frogs still die of hypothermia every winter; Coyote feels bad about this, but she'd rather just ignore the problem than try to deal with Sparrow again. 

MORAL: Buy a thermometer.

There were some visionary ideas and grand designs, but from the epidemic of urban freeways that cut scars across downtowns to the often-poorly executed massive """"urban renewal"""" projects like the one in my hometown of Washington, DC, there were dozens of mistakes that have had profound negative effects on the way people live. And while planners have (mostly) learned from their mistakes, the process of """"undoing"""" is difficult, if not impossible. People don't like change, and often they have very good reasons for liking change, even if the city they're in has serious issues. Plus fixing these things is expensive. The question of how to """"build"""" an prosperous, equitable, and happy city is purely an academic one. While new neighborhoods and suburban towns continue to go up, we're not going to be building any new metropolises.

I'm in grad school for urban planning and I'm really enjoying it. It allows me to apply my passion for understanding space and place to helping people. My passion for urban planning comes from the idea that so much of our day-to-day happiness is impacted by the layout and function of the built environment. Efficient public transit, smart parking policies, sufficient greenspace, and proper zoning laws effect where we choose to live and how much we enjoy our life. It's profoundly important to ensure that we don't let So what will the cities of the future look like?

October 2016,20,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/10/20/melon-and-the-multiverse/,"October 2016, 20",Melon and the multiverse,"Hi Listserve,

I’m writing to you in the early morning. My 2 year old son has spent the last hour rolling around on my head calling for melon until I finally relented and stumbled to the kitchen to fix him a bowl. The sky is lightening and the early morning fog that pours in from the bay is beginning to burn off. I’ve set myself up in the corner of our apartment where I sit cross-legged on my office chair and can peer over the computer to watch the kids with one eye as I write this. Which is to say that I am feeling cozy, and things are as peaceful as they get around here.

My name is Dan Brown, and I’m 37 years old. I live in Emeryville, CA with my wife and two kids and a dog. I’m a scientist and a statistician and I like to think about causal inference, particularly as it applies to occupational epidemiology. Which means that I try to study how to ask questions about how people’s work influences their health. Usually these questions are something like: “How much heart disease would this group of workers have if they were all breathing in a certain amount of chemicals while they were at work?”. I think this is a pretty important question, and there are a bunch of very interesting ways to ask it.

One of the most interesting things about this question is the things that answering it implies. When I say that I’m interested in what would happen if things were different, I’m inquiring about something that no one will ever see. I’m trying to determine the value of a variable that doesn’t exist in our world. We call these variables ‘counterfactuals’, since they tell us what would happen if, counter to the facts, the world was different. Which is some science fiction shit.

So, it always really surprised me that there’s this whole realm of serious academic and statistical research that’s based upon these things that are just totally imaginary. But a little while ago, I learned that some very clever physicists were able to do some experiments with light that proved that these counterfactuals do exist! They couldn’t see counterfactuals themselves (they don’t exist here), but they could see their reflection as they passed along the surface of our reality. Now this implies that the whole multiverse concept is true and where we live is just one of a possible infinite series of all the things that could be.

So the universe(s) are big and complicated and amazing and sometimes it gets a bit overwhelming. Which is why I have the following poem (by Alfred Tennyson) up on my wall. It reminds me that the small things we do and the small truths we learn are meaningful, and reflective of our own small stature in the scheme of things:

Flower in the crannied wall,I pluck you out of the crannies,I hold you here, root and all, in my hand,Little flower – but if I could understandWhat you are, root and all, and all in all,I should know what God and man is.

Thanks for reading, and in the immortal words of Abraham Lincoln: ‘Be excellent to each other’.

Much love,

I’m sure you’re allfamiliar with responsive design, yeah? Design that adjusts to the sizeof your screen. Well, context aware design is when the deviceconsiders the context in which it's placed, like environmentalfactors. Mobile devices can make recommendations set on location, theycan auto-adjust the contrast on a bright or gloomy day, they canpromote options based on your personal settings. Devices take intoconsideration their environments and act accordingly. And thesedevices are built by humans, which I feel as time goes on, are havingless context awareness. Maybe because of all the distractions orself-absorption.

I try to design context awareness into my everyday life. Being awareof not only my surroundings, but the people that inhabit it and thefeelings they exhibit has made a significant difference in myrelationships and impacted my life.

Whether you’re looking to connect with yourself or someone else,context awareness enables you to grow beyond just the courteous. Itallows you to explore other options, try on new ideas, ebb and flowwith other people’s energy. Opening a door, letting someone into yourlane, smiling as you walk by — that should be the standard. Findingsomething truly meant for you or giving someone something that’s trulymeant for them because you’re context aware, well that’s just awesome!

So, go auto-adjust someone’s gloomy day and create experiences thatare unique to your users. Personalize your interactions and connectwith your friends, your family, your fellow human beings; most of uswe’ll appreciate it.

We had taken our dog, whom we'd had for over 14 years, to be put down.  He was a wedding gift from my husband to me.  He was our """"baby"""" before we had babies, and when each of our children joined the family, he had no issues of jealousy or territory.  He accepted them instantly and loved them, sleeping under their cribs, following me around the house while I walked them to sleep, deftly avoiding them as crawlers and nascent walkers, becoming an enthusiastic playmate and a reluctant dress-up companion as they grew.  We moved him across an ocean with us and he took it in his happy stride.  His health had been gradually declining, with heart and kidney problems, but at the end, he deteriorated very quickly.  When the vet told us there was nothing more we could do but end his suffering, we felt shocked and desperate.  And those final moments with him, watching as he let go, were absolutely heartbreaking, for all of us.

After our heart-rending goodbye, we walked home from the vet, raw and hollow.  Once we got home, I opened my email to share the news with our friends and family, but instead I read a message that my grief-stricken brain could not understand.  It said that Sweet Briar was closing.

The significance of Sweet Briar College is nearly impossible to capture on paper.  It is a tiny, rural, liberal arts college in the gorgeous, rolling Blue Ridge foothills of central Virginia.  It is arrestingly beautiful, stunningly peaceful, and uniquely nurturing.  It is a salvation, a refuge, an inspiration, a motivation, and a home to those of us who are lucky enough to know it.  I met my husband there (improbably, at a women's college), I made many of my best friends there, I found my voice there. So many of us who call ourselves """"Vixens"""" know that the strength, determination, confidence, and honor with which we carry ourselves as women were distilled and refined during our years at Sweet Briar.

That evening, I closed my email without reading the entire message, because I simply could not process it.  There had been no warning, no indication of trouble or difficulty.  I was numb from loss already and could not begin to comprehend.

But, the next morning, I woke up not broken by loss or intimidated by the patronizing bluster of false finality, but as the fierce, determined, confident woman Sweet Briar had trained me to be.  And so did many, many of my alumnae sisters around the world.  And we began to fight, and to question, and to unravel the decision that had been made about our beloved alma mater.  Lawsuits were filed and funds were raised.  Questions were asked and deceptions were challenged.  The """"reasons"""" behind the decision were found to be largely baseless, and we moved forward with a conviction that we would not let Sweet Briar go quietly.  We shouted from the proverbial rooftops of social media and rallied local and national newspapers to our cause.  Slowly, inch by inch, we took back what was ours, and, with great effort and force of will, we won.  Sweet Briar has been saved, and, reminded of what we so nearly lost, her alumnae are freshly impassioned and more deeply committed.

They thought we would not fight.  They never expected us to win.  But Sweet Briar taught us to do what others might call impossible.  And so we did.

It’s twilight, & the sky’s a deep purple… I see 9 commercial airlines waiting to land at LAX. Also, I can see both the sun and the moon in the sky.

I’m alive, breathing the same air as you, walking on the ground you once stepped on, or one day will. … I can’t help but wonder if you and I have brushed shoulders somewhere in the world, we very well might have.

It’s 6:47pm on a Friday, and my dog, whom I utterly adore is curled up on my feet, fast asleep. I’m glad he is because his warm, heavy body is preventing me from getting up and procrastinating, or abandoning this email our of fear and self doubt.

I always imagined that if given the chance to write to the Listserve, I would somehow bang out the most insightful, life-changing, world hunger beating, polio-irradiating, humanity-healing email ever.

I realize that this is more than likely the largest audience I will ever have, and I am humbled to have the opportunity to reach you in as personal a space as your email.

You know, it’s very possible that as a collective, we have experienced every variation of human emotion… cool! Together, we’ve walked on every continent; who knows, maybe we’ve collectively darn near explored every corner of our earth.

I’m not a blind optimistic; I, too, live in the very same world that you do. Yes, I’m abridge to the issues that we as humanity are currently facing. I’m exposed to the same news as you, & inundated with messages of bigotry and discrimination, just like you. I only wish the media would gratify us with a little positivity every now and then. In actuality, we as a ‘people’ do kind, selfless, and amazing things every day, but they go unrecognized.

To quote the Listserve, “If given the opportunity, what would you say to a million people?” (statistic exaggeration!)Well, my answer is such; well, when it’s all said and done, apparently the content of this email is what I would say.

Before I slink away into obscurity, I want to create an opportunity for us to connect. If you feel inspired, do reach out.. I’d love to hear from you! You can email me at ‘shareyourstorieswithme11 @ gmail . com’.People fascinate the hell out of me; trust me, I wanna know your story, I truly do. So, indulge me, won’t you?

My instagram is @pld88, swing by & say hi!

In all probability, I will never get a chance to speak to you again.. but, I want to end by telling you that I love you.

We don’t one another, we might never will; but that’s inconsequential.

While reading this, know these words are from me to you; because YOU, yes.. you.. are whom I’ve been thinking of as I’ve been writing... I love you for all that you are, and all that you are not.I love all parts of you; all you have said, and all that remains unsaid.

It was an honor to have had the opportunity to connect with all you beautiful people. Stay happy, & always remember how immensely powerful you are.

From my heart to yours,In Gratitude,

I'm currently trying to make lemonade and I'm failing spectacularly! I recently moved to Botswana from Boston in the US due to some immigration issues that I won't get into because they'll make me cry.

The hardest part wasn't really the leaving of Boston; I can live anywhere, the hardest part is starting a new life with no familiar people as your markers, with no team of friends and advisors. Imagine being given an infinitely large field in a place that's not very familiar to you and being tasked with building a house, this freedom sounds great in theory but it's proven to be a lot frightening. As lovely as all that space is, where the heck should the house face? Where/who are my neighbors? Where is the road?  How big should the house be? What will the weather be like in 6 months? It's all very daunting and important, so I've decided I delay growing up, temporarily run away from my problems and travel for a bit. I know the point of these e-mails is to share something with you but I'm going to be needy and ask for something from you. Where are you in the world and where do you recommend I travel and what should I do there?

So, as not to leave you with absolutely nothing I'm gonna share with you my favorite people and places in Boston. First up, the best ever friends and sisters from other misters a girl could ask for: Valerie Tracy dot com is an awesome videographer/graphic designer/ photographer based in Boston, don't take my word for it, google her and see for yourself. Betsy Slate works for BU and is a brilliant academic and creative individual (I didn't know people like that existed either,) if you have a kick-ass job to offer her in Boston or the west coast please find her on linkedIn.

If you're looking for the best coffee in all of the eastern seaboard, then Neighborhoods Cafe in Fenway, Boston is worth checking out (say hi to Betsy for me) and finally, if you're looking for a community of people so awesome that leaving them could quite literally be the cause of some of the greatest pain you've ever felt then please check out City Church in Boston. E-mail me and let me know how you're doing, give me travel recommendations and maybe some other thoughts too: KeletsoCharlotteM at gmail dot com

Most of us city-dwellers ride solo, but the curious introvert never feels alone. You distract yourself from the fact that you’re holding on to the hand rails (with more upper body strength than you thought you ever had) as you develop stories about any one of the peculiar, fascinating human beings that takes this short journey with you.

My micro adventure began when I vacated my seat, and a sweet old man took my spot. Little did he know, I had stood up for entirely selfish reasons - there was a highly pungent smell in the general area. Meandering past a teen couple sharing Pokemon Go strategies, I find a seemingly secure spot to park. I happen to stand directly next to a relatively tall man, clad in red-striped flannel, with a death grip on a medium-sized wireless HP printer.

What happened next could only truly be savored in person; he reached deep into his pocket, and in one swift motion, he opened up a chicken nugget-sized flip phone. As he swiftly typed away with his right thumb, using the T9 function (presumably), I started to wonder what type of guy would purchase a printer that connects to WiFi when his mobile device doesn’t have the same function. Was he purchasing it for his tattooed live-in girlfriend that, earlier that afternoon, tripped over the mass of wires that littered their apartment floor, and cried out that she just couldn’t take it anymore? Was he installing it for his grandmother that assumed her 20-something grandson knew more about technology than she, even though he will need to meticulously read the user manual and take about 5 hours setting it up? Was he just trying to turn over a new leaf?

As I continued to mull it over, I mindlessly unlocked my phone to check Instagram for the third time in the last hour. One of my high school acquaintances that no one has heard from since 2009 besides the occasional vague social media post posted an image with swirly text saying, “People with fewer choices are happier.” This guy liked non-smartphones because he has three options: call, text, or play snake. He most likely picked out the wireless printer closest to the entrance at Best Buy because choosing among hundreds of printers is objectively terrifying; you are forced to live knowing that you are missing out on something. I put away my phone and realized - printer guy pretty much has it all figured out.

Disclosure: I am promoting my blog because my goal is to make at least a handful of introverts feel like they can use their powerful observational skills and introspection to their advantage in finding meaningful experiences in everyday life.

October 2016,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/10/13/i-kill-people-for-money/,"October 2016, 13",I kill people for money...,"...Okay, not real people - I'm a writer-director for film and TV. So I've killed a LOT of people on screen. There's more to the job than that, but if anyone is going to complain about something you've made, it's usually a death scene, either for the gore, or the loss of a favourite character.

I wrote the movies Severance, Cockneys Vs Zombies, Tower Block, TV episodes of Doctor Who, Torchwood, Spooks, Primeval, Crusoe, Crossing Lines, Eve, among others. I've directed short films, festival idents, and webseries. And, along the way, people end up dying. Drama where nothing goes wrong and everyone survives isn't particularly dramatic. So as the saying goes, if you want to make an omelette, you have to brutally murder some innocent people...

When people find out what I've written, their first question is usually """"do you write the whole story, or just the dialogue?"""" Yes, when I write scripts, I do both the story and the dialogue. Everything you see and hear on screen, has to be in the script first, otherwise they don't know what sets to build, what people say, and what happens. Obviously there is some improvisation on set, things change, but it all starts with a script.

It's a strange job. You work alone, writing, for weeks, occasionally meeting the team for feedback if you're on something that's in production. If you're directing, you have a short burst of shooting before you disappear into a dark room to edit, grade, do the sound, fx, etc. And then you unleash it on an unsuspecting audience.

The most stressful part is just before it's released. Suddenly, you start second guessing yourself. What if everyone hates it? I'm a fraud. I'm terrible. I'm ugly. I smell. My career is over. But then you see your work unfold on screen, and all the hard work and worries are worth it. And you remember why you do this: to give people something entertaining, something they'll be talking about the next day.

And that's why it's the best job in the world. Even if nobody quite understands it.

My current project coincides with me winning the Listserve lottery - it's a webseries, which has just started airing the first season online, so I'm still in the """"worry"""" phase. The hardest part of doing a webseries is letting people know it exists, so I'd love it if you had a look. It's a modernised, vlog-style adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula (I'm trying not to say """"Vladaptation""""). I've flipped the characters around so that Mina and Lucy are the heroes instead of the boys, it's a funnier, more self aware take, with plenty of left turns - even if you think you know the story, you'll have some surprises along the way.

And obviously, because it's Dracula, not everyone will make it to the end in one piece. But you'll have to wait and see. It's called Mina Murray's Journal (minasjournal[dot]com), if you check out the show's Twitter account at @MinasJournal or mine at @JamesMoran then you'll find the links. If you like it, please like, subscribe, and/or pass it on to someone else that might like it! These things live or die on word of mouth, and it's very much a labour of love for me, so I really want people to see it.

Thanks for reading this, I hope you enjoy some of my work (some of which is on Netflix, DVD, etc). And thanks to PJ Holden for introducing me to the Listserve!

This is not as new or shocking as you might think. From lead to asbestos to cigarettes, over the 20th century, industry actors became skilled at the art of scientific manipulation. The goal of it all? To prevent or delay governmental regulation of their products.

The dangers of asbestos exposure were first documented in the 1930’s, and were immediately followed by industry efforts to co-opt the scientific establishment and control research agendas and publications (Wikeley 1992). Murray (1988), documents the strategies employed by the asbestos industry, noting that “the effect was to claim the mantle of science for those opposed to stricter control of asbestos, to tarnish proponents of stricter regulation with the stain of 'politics', and to accuse the scientists among them of being less than responsible in their claims about the danger of asbestos.”

Leaded gasoline and paint followed a similar course, with regulatory efforts spanning half a century. In this case, scientific and political manipulation contributed to the lead poisoning of an entire generation. In 1976, average lead levels in the blood of U.S. children under the age of six were found to be 16.5 μg/dL (Kovarik 2005). To put this in perspective, more recent studies have established that intellectual deficits begin to appear with blood lead levels of 7.5 μg/dL (Lanphear et al. 2005). The CPSC’s injury cost model determines that if a child between the ages of 0-4 is exposed to lead resulting in blood/lead levels of 2 µg/dL, ignoring all other developmental and physical consequences, they are expected to experience an average IQ loss of 1.9 points, reducing lifetime earnings potential by 3.3% (Miller & Bhattacharya 2013).

Skipping over the tobacco industry, today, these same manipulative strategies are being applied by both the chemical and fossil fuel industries. The fossil fuels industry has provided climate change deniers with a wealth of “scientific” evidence that they can use to justify their positions (Michaels 2008). Following in the footsteps of the asbestos industry, they have been wildly successful at manipulating the public by framing climate change as a political issue. A Pew research poll released this week showed that only 48% of Americans (and 15% of conservative Republicans) believed that climate change was caused by human activity (Funk & Kennedy 2016).

The next round of scientific manipulation has already begun by the chemical industry, who has mounted a massive effort to obfuscate the science and manipulate the public concerning the hazards associated with endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including BPA, phthalates, certain pesticides and flame retardants. Last month I finished a paper documenting the chemical industry’s strategy on EDCs, which was recently recommended for publication in the journal Science and Public Policy. If you want to dig deeper, check out the work of Stephane Horel who has done a good job of documenting the European side of things.

If anyone out there is working on these issues and would like to hire me or take me on as a PhD student, I recently finished my masters thesis (similar topic) and am looking for work while putting together applications. I’d be happy to forward you my CV.

But I know how many I’ve won. Four — in a row. After I won the first one, I don’t know, I must have awakened some kind of code, because I haven’t lost one since. Maybe it’s because I’m competitive. You have to be. Otherwise, how would you find motivation to spend a day or two locked in a room with a bunch of developers with the single goal of building a business from scratch, knowing it will never materialize, and that on Monday, you’ll be back to your usual job? But that’s what I like about it. It’s a creative environment.

Most developers think the real challenge is programming something in a limited amount of time. But it’s not. It’s the development of the idea. You don’t arrive at a hackathon and have a eureka moment like “this is what I’m going to do, let’s start programming!” Using a rapid application delivery platform provides freedom with no worries about coding and plumbing. I can focus on the value I add to the idea and on the innovation. Then programming is quick. That’s a real advantage.

At the last hackathon, the challenge was to build an app to check the status of building permits. I finished the app in two, maybe three hours. So, I used the rest of the time to evolve and improve it. I slept, I ate, I took a shower, while the other teams spent the whole day and night just programming the app. Using a rapid application delivery platform is not cheating, it’s just being smarter.

I don’t think that’s the only reason I win. But it definitely helps.

Hello world,

Everyone has a to-do list. Few just keep it restricted to self, others write it down somewhere so that others can read and maybe motivate or help in ticking the items off it. What about your to-do list?

Traveling to new places has been one of the top items on my to-do list but have not been able to keep up with it in recent years. Hoping to add a lot of places to visited list soon.

I fell in love with cycling a few years back and completed my first brevet this year. Looking forward to riding PBP in 2019.

Have always loved writing code to solve problems. Thanks to my high school teachers for introducing with it in a great way. RaspberryPi and Arduino have taken this to a new level. Omega2 is joining the club soon.

I write computer code for a living. Currently trying to reduce effort in recruiting by using technology.

Looking ahead for surprises from life with a beginner’s mind.

Thanks for listening.

Stay healthy. Stay connected.

He sent me a copy of the message that was distributed to all 20K+ of you.  I thought that the concept was cool (and I thought his entry was very funny) so I signed up myself.

Today is my birthday.  It is also my brother’s birthday (we were born on the same day, although I am 3 years older than he is).

Somehow The Listserve gods knew that today was special, and picked me as “winner” of the day.

I’m totally unworthy of this.  I’ve paid no “dues”.  I’m sure most of you have been signed up for years, waiting to be picked.  With the exception of my brother’s contribution, I’ve never even READ a Listserve entry before.

So I’m going to jump right in.

Twice a week, I commute from my home in Baltimore, Maryland to Arlington. Virginia.  It often takes more than 2 hours in each direction, and the traffic is horrendous.

To survive the monotony of the commute, sometimes I like to make up a game to keep my mind occupied.  Six months ago, I invented a game called “Think of 10 Songs that have a person’s name in the song title.  The person’s name has to start with the letter “A”.  No duplicate artists.  Rank them in favorite order”.

Here’s what I came up with for “A”:

1) Andrew in Drag - The Magnetic Fields2) Allison - Slowdive3) Ana Ng - They Might Be Giants4) Annie's Song - John Denver5) Angie - Tori Amos (Rolling Stones Cover)6) Alice's House - Psychedelic Furs7) Sweet Adeline - Elliott Smith8) Ballad of Adam and Eve - Moose9) Alex Chilton - The Replacements10) Alice - The Sisters of Mercy

I’ve now done the same thing with letters B-E:1) Buddy Bradley - Adam Green2) Bela Lugosi's Dead - Bauhaus3) Bea - Throwing Muses4) Dead Billy - Big Black5) Bob - Weird Al6) Me and Bobby McGee - Janis Joplin7) Blue Jean - David Bowie8) Beth - Kiss9) Ballad of Bilbo Baggins - Leonard Nimoy10) Batman (Theme Song) - Neil Hefti

1) Taste of Cindy - Jesus and Mary Chain2) Caroline Says II - Lou Reed3) Clementine - Elliott Smith4) Christine - Siouxsie and the Banshees5) Carolina - Adam Green6) Calypso - Suzanne Vega7) Charlotte Sometimes - The Cure8) Oh Carolina - Shaggy9) Cybele's Reverie - Stereolab10) Cactus Man - Eureka Birds

1) Daniel Cowman - Regina Spektor2) Don, A Man - Slint3) Beautiful Delilah - The Kinks4) Don Henley Must Die - Mojo Mixon5) Ghost of David - Damien Jurado6) Dazie Mae - John Lee Hooker7) Lovelee Sweet Darlene - My Bloody Valentine8) Doreen - Mark Sandman9) Donna - Ritchie Valens10) Delores - Th' Faith Healers

1) Eloise - The Damned2) Elvira -Oak Ridge Boys3) Eleanor Rigby - The Beatles4) Eddie's Teddy - Rocky Horror Picture Show5) Evelyn - Pop Will Eat Itself6) Eric B. is President - Eric B and Rakim7) Goodbye Earl - Dixie Chicks8) Erik's Song - Slowdive9) Emily - Adam Green10) Eazy Er Said Than Dunn - Eazy E

We're welcomed at a nondescript door with a crisp high-five, then we pack ourselves through to the back room of a comic book store. Sitting shoulder-to-shoulder, Fidlar's """"Cheap Beer"""" pipes through speakers clearly too big for the venue and we erupt into song. """"I DRINK CHEAP BEER, SO WHAT, F- YOU!"""" So begins the best comedy show in LA.

...and all that is coming to an end. After nearly six years of entertaining a devoted audience in the back of Meltdown Comics, the sun is setting on The Meltdown Show. I watched as Jonah, Kumail, Emily, and Ed stood up on stage to delivered a powerful and heartfelt goodbye, followed up with """"We haven't told Comedy Central yet... Don't tweet about this!"""" There was a mix of tears and laughter from all around. A few of us regulars climbed up on stage to give them all hugs and personal thanks, and the show ended in a standing ovation. We laughed, we shouted, and we cried together for what seemed like an eternity before Emily managed to take back control. """"Guys! I can't look at any of you right now. There's still three weeks left! Save all your energy to make those shows the best.""""

@StevenRayMorris put it best. """"Most of the regular attendees would describe going to The Meltdown like going to church. For one night a week we held service where the power of laughter transcended all the bad things in our lives."""" Meltdown has been my only constant these last few years. It's helped me through the loss of loved ones, rough patches, and much more. I'm afraid to lose that, but I'm certain the bonds between us all will far outlast the show and I know everything will be okay in the end.

Here's a Spotify playlist of the show's themes + comedians I've had the opportunity to see here. Check out the Twitter Hashtag #MeltdownMemorieshttp://spoti.fi/2cVFyhi

When I read this article two years ago, I thought """"If I win this listserve thing I just subscribed to, I need to share this"""". Why ? Because I love all the urban legends or stories behind Bill Murray, how he crashed in parties of unknown people, drive a taxi or sneak to steal two french fries and say """"no one will believe you""""

Also because I don't have any life advice or highly though after theory. I'm a 39 years old white male trying to understand and confront what are my own privileges in this patriarcal society to help my daughter grow in a good person understanding and getting rid of the limitations society will want to throw at her.

Step one to being more like Bill Murray: Sing. And really be into it. Murray is not his ironic Saturday Night Live lounge singer and he is not his Lost in Translation actor abroad, singing a half-asleep version of “More Than This.” He sings when the mood strikes him, and when it does, he means it. As he walked out onstage on Friday night at the Toronto Film Festival to the sounds of Prince’s “Raspberry Beret,” Murray grabbed a microphone and sang a few verses of the song. He would repeat the performance (sans mike) at an after-party later that night, where he would also lead a dance party, as he has been known to do in the past.

Friday was “Bill Murray Day” at the festival, and it consisted of screenings of Murray classics Stripes, Ghostbusters, and Groundhog Day, and the world premiere of his new film, St. Vincent, in which he plays a grumpy old man tasked with watching the child of his neighbor, played by Melissa McCarthy. During the Q&A, moderated by Scrooged screenwriter Mitch Glazer, and featuring Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman, Murray dropped so many pieces of life wisdom that it seemed only right to gather it into a Bill Murray Guide to Life. (Copyright: us.)

Step two to being more like Bill Murray: Just be honest. The St. Vincent role came about, said Murray, “because they couldn’t get Jack Nicholson.” After the audience roared in laughter, he continued, “No really. It’s well-documented.”

Related StoriesBill Murray Is Terrible at Babysitting Melissa McCarthy’s Kid in the St. Vincent TrailerA Field Guide to Tracking Bill Murray in the WildStep three: Always make time for your friends. On a day when all of Toronto was celebrating him, and he had a full slate of press for St. Vincent, Murray still carved out time to see Welcome To Me, an audaciously wacko comedy about a woman with bipolar disorder (Kristen Wiig), who’s obsessed with Oprah, wins the lottery, and buys herself a talk show on a failing cable network. It’s the first film by Shira Piven, wife of Anchorman director Adam McKay, and Will Ferrell is one of the producers. “It’s one of the strangest movies I’ve ever seen,” he said. “The bravery to make this movie is pretty impressive. It’s quite a piece of work. I mean, the funny stuff is maybe bolder than anything we’ve seen in a very, very long time. And it’s not just a funny movie. There’s a lot going on. I’m still thinking about what happened.”

Step four: Be spontaneous. Many people are aware of Murray’s penchant for popping in on random karaoke nights, or doing dishes at other people’s house parties, or crashing wedding photo shoots. But this is not a new thing. According to Reitman, Murray has always been that way. Back in the day, before he was ever on SNL, Murray used to go up to people on the streets of New York and yell, “Watch out, there’s a lobster loose, hot butter’s the only way to get it!” in the voice he’d later use in Caddyshack. “He’s going up to strangers in Manhattan and they’re laughing. They don’t know who this guy is, but he’s making them laugh, and he’s totally spontaneous and they just have to go with it.”

Step five: Leave yourself open to magical moments. It’s unclear how long ago this was, but Murray told a tale of being in a cab in Oakland and finding out his cab driver was a saxophone player. The driver, however, never got to practice because he drove 14 hours a day. So when Murray also found out the guy’s sax was in the trunk, he had him pull over, get out his horn, sit in the back, and play while Murray drove. “You know, that’s like two and two. It makes four,” Murray said. “Not only did he play all the way to Sausalito, which is a long ways, but we stopped and got barbecue. He was playing at what people would call a sketchy rib place in Oakland at like 2:15 in the morning. It’s like, ‘Relax, man. You’ve got the fucking horn. We’re cool here.’ He’s blowing the horn and the crowd’s like, ‘What the hell’s that crazy white dude playing that thing?’ And it was great. It made for a beautiful night. I think we’d all do that, if you saw that moment and you’re, as we say, available, you’d make the connection and you’d do it right.”

Step six: Stay relaxed and success will follow. “Someone told me some secrets early on about living. You have to remind yourself that you can do the very best you can when you’re very, very relaxed. No matter what it is, no matter what your job is, the more relaxed you are, the better you are. That’s sort of why I got into acting. I realized that the more fun I had, the better I did it, and I thought, Well, that’s a job I can be proud of. I’d be proud to have that job, if I had to go to work and say, ‘No matter what my condition or what my mood is, no matter how I feel about what’s going on in my life, if I can relax myself and enjoy what I’m doing and have fun with it, then I can do my job really well.’ And it’s changed my life, learning that. And it’s made me better at what I do. I’m not the greatest or anything. But I really enjoy what I do.”

Step seven: Remember that you are you and no one else is. The night’s final question was “What’s it like being you?” Murray responded with a guru-level reminder about the importance of being present, which we’ll reprint in full and embed in audio form below.

I think if I’m gonna answer that question, because it is a hard question, I’d like to suggest that we all answer that question right now, while I’m talking. I’ll continue. Believe me, I won’t shut up. I have a microphone. But let’s all ask ourselves that question right now. What does it feel like to be you? What does it feel like to be you? Yeah. It feels good to be you, doesn’t it? It feels good, because there’s one thing that you are — you’re the only one that’s you, right?. So you’re the only one that’s you, and we get confused sometimes — or I do, I think everyone does — you try to compete. You think, Dammit, someone else is trying to be me. Someone else is trying to be me. But I don’t have to armor myself against those people; I don’t have to armor myself against that idea if I can really just relax and feel content in this way and this regard. If I can just feel, just think now: How much do you weigh? This is a thing I like to do with myself when I get lost and I get feeling funny. How much do you weigh? Think about how much each person here weighs and try to feel that weight in your seat right now, in your bottom right now. Parts in your feet and parts in your bum. Just try to feel your own weight, in your own seat, in your own feet. Okay? So if you can feel that weight in your body, if you can come back into the most personal identification, a very personal identification, which is: I am. This is me now. Here I am, right now. This is me now. Then you don’t feel like you have to leave, and be over there, or look over there. You don’t feel like you have to rush off and be somewhere. There’s just a wonderful sense of well-being that begins to circulate up and down, from your top to your bottom. Up and down from your top to your spine. And you feel something that makes you almost want to smile, that makes you want to feel good, that makes you want to feel like you could embrace yourself.So what’s it like to be me? You can ask yourself, What’s it like to be me? You know, the only way we’ll ever know what it’s like to be you is if you work your best at being you as often as you can, and keep reminding yourself: That’s where home is.

My grandmother passed away two years ago at the age of 98. She had a big family — 7 children, 18 Grandchildren, 32 Great-grandchildren, and 15 Great Great-grandchildren — and was a huge influence on all of us. She had a great sense of humor, never stopped reading or learning, and possessed wisdom that truly only comes with having lived for almost ten decades.

Most of her extended family would gather at her house every year for Thanksgiving. I grew up thinking Thanksgivings of 50-60 people were commonplace. On Thanksgiving of 2009, at 91 years-old, she wrote the following “letter” and had it read to everyone before dinner.

I hope some of her wisdom affects your life in a positive way, as it has mine.

Old Age

(How I feel being so old…)

I have decided it’s a gift…

I am so blessed to have this wonderful family around me all these years. This may be a surprise to you all, but for the first time in my life, I’m the person I wanted to be – not my body…I can’t control the wrinkles and my wobbly legs or my bad-hair days. Oh well, my hair is almost gone, so I don’t have to worry about that. I would never trade my friends or my beautiful and loving family for more hair, a flatter belly, or fewer wrinkles.

I have become my own friend and I am happy! I know that I forget, but some things in life are just as well forgotten. Over the years, my heart has been broken when you lose a loved one, but broken hearts are what give us strength and understanding and compassion.

I’m blessed to have lived this long and still am able to laugh at my children, grandchildren, great AND great-great grandchildren.

I am not going to live forever, but while I’m still here I won’t waste my time on what could have been, or worry about what will be. But I hope the glue that has held this wonderful and loving family together all these years never comes apart.

May you always have a rainbow in your smile and love for each other in your hearts.

May God Bless you all……Mamoo

I couldn’t have been selected to win the listserve at a less opportune moment. Three months ago, a year ago, or even a year from now I think I would have had many charming, insightful things to send to the many of you who enjoy reading these e-mails everyday.

I’m in a very transitional place in my life: I’ve graduated from law school and taken the bar exam, of which I am awaiting the results. I am currently unemployed and waiting until I have passed the bar exam to apply for the one job I really want—to be a trademark examiner at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. I am currently homeless, living in cheap hotels, Airbnbs, and upon the generosity of friends and family until I find a permanent home in Washington, D.C. The person I love may need to move to the other side of the world so he can pursue his career goals, so my romantic life feels in transition too.

My future feels very uncertain, and the more time I live in all my uncertainties the less confident I feel about the choices I have made. This is a new feeling for me, being uncertain, especially about the big things in my life, and I don’t like the feeling at all.

So, instead of platitudes, and cheesy life lessons that I’m not qualified to give, here are some things that have make me happy, maybe they will make you happy too!

Books: The Floating Opera, Kitchens of the Great Midwest, Garlic and Sapphires, Harry Potter (the audiobooks are my equivalent of drinking a glass of wine and taking a bath, the effect is that calming)

Television: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Friday Night Lights, The West Wing, Parks and Recreation, Veronica Mars, Top Chef, X-Files, the Office

Music: When I was younger I kept up with music ambitiously, but as I get older I only really like listening to music when I’m sad. So, I’ve been listening to a LOT of Amy Winehouse recently. This will not make you happy….so maybe…Devo?

Podcasts: Podcasts are great because you can listen to them while going on a walk or while cooking or driving. Some of the ones that make me happy are Reply All, You Must Remember This, Mystery Show, How to Be Amazing with Michael Ian Black, The Memory Palace, TANIS and The Black Tapes, This American Life, and most recently, Harry Potter and the Sacred Text

If you’re an American, please vote in November!

When I saw the body, I immediately thought ""that's not him"". The makeup was the wrong color. It didn't look like him. His hand felt plasticky. Something was missing. Where was the twinkle in his eye as made sarcastic jokes? He was gone. Seeing the body made it feel so real.

The last time I saw him was a couple months prior. I had no idea that it would be the last hug goodbye. It all happened so fast. Sickness and then death.

Hug the people you love!

I am not afraid of death. My mind used to want me to die. Depression is a horrible thing, a blackness that seeps into every corner of your mind. Things are a bit better now.

I still struggle to find meaning in life. I grew up in a religious home, but I am not religious anymore. I came to a point where I couldn't find any other reason to believe other than it was what I had been taught my entire life. Sometimes I wish I could force myself to believe, but that is just not possible. Ever since I gave up on religion, I've felt lost. Religion provided a framework for how to live my life, and had answers to questions of meaning and purpose. Now I am left without that framework, and must find my own meaning. But how?

What gives your life meaning? What do you live for?

I would love to hear your answers to these questions.

October 2016,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/10/01/immigrant-stories/,"October 2016, 01",Immigrant stories,"01. A made up language

When I was about 3, I started learning to read and asked my older brother to help out. We loved to hang out together, the dynamic being him trolling me at every step and me getting frustrated while trying to get my revenge. During his gig as a reading tutor, he started intentionally misspelling words on paper to get entertained by my mispronunciations. Do this a few hundred times and - by accident - we ended up creating this pig-latin like language. Super fun - speak it fast enough and parents can't understand a thing. Neighbors get confused and people on the street struggle to figure out which country you moved from. The language rules became apparent only years after our brains were already excelling at swapping consonants and vocals within syllables of complex words. A good friend eventually also picked it up, increasing the speakers of this endangered language to 3, while our parents remained clueless. ""Echamaifyciivonoak!""

02. Understanding evolution

That moment when the angels sing, the world around you fades to white and you're in awe of all these small miracles... it happened to me when I finally understood the basic process of evolution.

Are you confident you can explain evolution to a 10-year-old?

It's easy, it's just a series of happy accidents. An error in the copying process that sometimes results in an improvement in the next generation. A bump that becomes a wing, a pinhole that turns into an eye - not overnight, but after a hundred or a billion times you end up with beautiful dandelion parachutes designed by what Dawkins calls the blind watchmaker.

03. Fragments of life *

These are some random stories from someone who lives in the US but wasn’t born here. Another immigrant from a former communist country, with other siblings living all around the world. Different perspectives enabled by somewhat open borders and tolerance.

I’ve seen our own politicians and far right extremists being openly racist on national TV, being hosted purely for ad revenue. Whenever I see the combed-over xenophobic orange clown foaming at the mouth, I'm also seeing all the red flags and hearing alarm bells ringing at full volume. All the signs are there, ask any of your acquaintances coming from different cultures - we've seen it all before and learned to avoid and reject these individuals.

You are now facing two choices: to learn from other people's mistake or make your own. The impact of a bad choice will most likely reverberate and negatively impact your life over the next few years. It's not ""what's the worst that could happen"" it's how long it will that take for the nation to recover. It's years that mean little on a historical scale but will represent a sizable chunk of your own life. I left my own country because the recovery was not happening fast enough. After November 8 I might have to do it all over again.

The circus is the clowns you get as candidates for public office-the cesspool is the money that sloshes around and floats the whole system. The Koch brothers and other assorted 1% worthies intend to use the Citizens United court decision to finally turn the USA into the Potterville of “It’s a Wonderful Life”.

When Benjamin Franklin was leaving the Constitutional Convention of 1787 he was asked by a woman what type of government they were to have and he responded, “A republic, if you can keep it.”

Jump forward to 2016 and he seems like a colonial Nostradamus. But John F Kennedy said that “Our problems are man-made, therefore they may be solved by man.”

Let me offer a simple JFK style solution to complex campaign finance laws that block the voice of the people from being heard:

Only individual persons who are US citizens can donate money to a candidate for public office, and individual persons can only donate money to candidates for public office that they are eligible to vote for.

Now that doesn’t solve the problems in the presidential race but it would have a hell of an impact on elections for Congress. The Koch brothers could only buy one congressman and two senators each, instead of buying them all in bulk.Just a thought:

1.       Since Congress passed a law making it a crime to lie to a federal investigator, shouldn’t they pass another law making it a crime for a member of Congress to lie to the American people?

2.       Too much secrecy? Every government document that is classified must be signed by the person who classified it and classifications can only be for 5 years. And why can a corporation hide its’ true owners?

3.       Big banks too big to fail? I don’t think so. There are 12 geographically located Federal Reserve districts in the USA that “supervise banks”. Pick a district-any district-but you can only operate in one.

4.       And finally-all federal judges must take Senior Status at 75 years of age. That means that they can still work as judges; just not sit on the Appellate Courts or the Supreme Court. They tend to get a tad crotchety after 75-and congress can do that with a simple law.

Depressed enough? Sorry about that, nobody ever said that change was easy. I don’t want to leave you totally bummed out, so the best .99 cent book on Amazon is “The Birds of Baghdad.”  And try Tulley’s French Roast coffee-it’ll snap your head back in the morning and get you ready to go out and slay some dragons, or take back your country.

They all originate in Shetland, a group of 100 small islands, 16 of which are inhabited, in the far north of Scotland where I was born, and where I've lived most of my life.Shetland is always singular, and never plural, as in ""The Shetlands"". Shetlanders cringe when people say ""The Shetlands"". It's Shetland, pure and simple. No one speaks of The Scotlands or The Englands, or even cities like The New Yorks or The Londons. Shetland is always singular.

Shetland lies at 60 degrees north, the same latitude as southern Greenland, southern Alaska, and St Petersburg in Russia. The islands are warmed by the Gulf Stream, a warm water current originating in the Gulf of Mexico, so it isn't nearly as cold in Shetland as you might imagine.

Shetland lies below the Arctic Circle, so we don't actually get a midnight sun, but at the height of summer it never gets properly dark. You could read a newspaper in natural light at midnight. The sun dips below the horizon for a few hours at night in summer, a time we refer to as the Simmer Dim. In the depths of winter, by contrast, we only have a few hours of daylight each day.

Shetland is Scottish now, but 547 years ago it was Norwegian territory. Denmark ruled Norway in 1469, and Margaret, daughter of King Christian I of Denmark, became engaged to James III of Scotland. Christian I pawned Shetland to the Scottish crown as a wedding dowry. Princess Margaret unfortunately drowned when the boat taking her to Scotland capsized in a storm, and therefore the wedding between her and James III of Scotland never took place. However, Shetland remained part of Scotland, even though the Danish crown tried to redeem the islands on no less than eight official occasions.

Shetland's Norse heritage is still very evident today, especially in the place names, which all have strong Norse origins. Scottish bagpipes, haggis and kilts have no tradition in Shetland, though we do like a wee dram of whisky, occasionally. The people there once spoke their own language, Norn, which finally died out around the end of the 17th century. The language was never written down, so it is effectively dead today.

The people of Shetland still speak what is known as the Shetland Dialect, a mixture of Old Norse/Norn, Lowland Scots and English. It is unintelligible to English speakers. I grew up speaking Shetland Dialect, but when I went to school we were not allowed to speak our dialect in the classroom, and had to learn and speak proper English. I speak perfect English now, but I have never forgotten my original ""language"".

Today I live in the village of Aldeacentenera, Extremadura, Spain where I moved with my family 10 years ago. I work through the Internet, writing web content for clients all over the world. I've been doing that for over 20 years. It pays well and it offers me a lot of freedom.

Life here is surprisingly similar to Shetland, though the language and climate are very different. It is quiet and unrushed, the crime level is reassuringly low and the people are warm, friendly and open. The scenery and landscapes in the Province of Cáceres here are simply stunning, and we are happy to be a part of it.

Do I miss Shetland? Not really too much. I visit back regularly, though; Shetland will always be a part of me.

I'm on the cusp of adulthood and definitely feeling some paranoia and anxiousness. My life is currently consumed by school, swimming, and stressing about college. 

I want to be a veterinarian and always have ever since I knew what a vet was. I'm passionate about science and animals and none of the gross stuff bothers me even a little. I'm working my butt off right now in the hopes that I'll be able to go to a good university that I really enjoy and then end up working even harder in the hopes that I'll be accepted into a veterinary college. (If anyone out there is a vet, vet med student, or animal science major and has any advice about this career path feel free to email me! I'd love to chat). 

It's been rough for me these past few years. When I was 15 I suffered a traumatic brain injury. I was unconscious for almost an hour, had minor bleeding in my brain, and lost about two thirds of my memory. It made school feel almost impossible and it has taken years to recover from. It has altered my personality immensely and changed a lot of my relationships with people. I am actually grateful for it in the sense that it gave me the chance to recreate the kind of person I wanted to be and I had to start almost all of my friendships from scratch. It made school tough and it's made getting on the right path for the career of my dreams even tougher but I have almost fully recovered at this point. 

I love music. Porter Robinson, the postal service, twenty one pilots, Dillion Francis, Coldplay, Alesso, classical, alternative, electronic. 

If you have any advice for someone about to begin their adult life please send it my way, it would be much appreciated.

Chicken Tortilla Soup

Ingredients:Three to four chicken breasts, frozen (chicken will overcook if it's not frozen when you start)Two 28oz cans diced fire-roasted tomatoesOne to two 14.5oz cans black beans, drainedOne 14.5oz can whole kernel corn, drained (1 small bag frozen corn also works)One to two small cans diced jalapenosOne small jar salsa of your choice (I like tomatillo)

Spray bottom of crock-pot with cooking spray to prevent sticking. Place frozen chicken breasts in bottom of crock-pot. Dump remaining ingredients on top (make sure chicken is fully covered). Cook on low 8 hours. Remove chicken breasts, shred with fork, and mix shredded chicken back into soup. Serve and top with shredded cheese and crumbled tortilla chips, plus anything else that sounds good (sour cream, salsa, hot sauce, diced avocados if you feel up to dicing something, etc.). Enjoy!

Also, shameless plug: 

I'm running the Boston Half Marathon in a few weeks to raise money for Shattuck Partners, a non-profit dedicated to making medical and mental health treatment accessible to underserved adults in Boston. As someone who works in social services, I've seen what a difference access to care can make for families in my community.

I did not expect to win this lottery so soon - I joined Listserve only about 6 months ago! Writing something meaningful that resonates with thousands is a bit daunting, but equally exciting. So here we go.

A little bit about me: I am in a happy state right now; had a painful but relieving break-up; got promoted at work and overall life's good. Realized that we just need to own up to our own mistakes in order to be happy. Forcing myself to smile each morning, singing out songs loudly in my car on the way to work, talking to everyone with a smile and being grateful to whatever higher power there is every now and then helps me move along life pretty neatly. (Touchwood!)Here's a small poem I wrote about living life the way it comes, about going the way the road takes us and about being humble instead of stubborn in the face of change. Hope y'all like it!

TEACH ME...Tell me Dear Cloud,Where did you learn to fly;To fearlessly soar in peace,And to effortlessly breathe the sky

Tell me how, you stay aboveThe doldrums of this landscape;And teach me your dignity,When Gusts leave you no escape

That imperious, innocent Wind with her antics,And her mad, mischievous, mutable smirk;Cloud, you wear it all with a smileAnd with grace, forgive her every quirk

Timid is her arrogance,Her naiveté neighbors neglect;Invisibly she wields her way through you,And yet seldom you object

Fierce is your humility,Your maturity margins magic;You give her cowardice a beautiful faceMaking her ungratefulness much more tragic

I’m sure you see futilityIn coaching us Humans humility,For we cannot differ between Pride and ego;Mistaking modesty for meekness wherever we go

But educate me still, How you like a parentAre the Sky we look up to in delight;And then how you comfort with a cushiony bedWhen this child looks down from his shaky flight

You dance to the Wind, as to Life we dance,You see her in the eye, but we never even glance,You flow with her, and we defy in vain,We fight change, you never complain

I now see you’ve already taught us all,Yet impervious we are now to old wisdom,Oblivious to our fall;The most resolute of men,Once had a saying,About listening to the penEven when the sword is praying;

So remind me again Cloud,Where did you learn to fly;To fearlessly soar in peace,And to effortlessly breathe the sky.

September 2016,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/24/a-christmas-memory/,"September 2016, 24",A Christmas Memory,"First before my story my brief PSA. Vaccinate yourself and your children. You're not only protecting yourself/child but all of the people who can't be vaccinated and are immunosuppressed. They don't cause autism. 

The most memorable, but saddening, holiday memory I have is the death of my favorite pet animal.

My pet's was name was Othello. He had started out as just a farm animal, but after awhile his affectionate smile and wiggly tail got our attention and we just could not let him go. He became out pet. For awhile we kept him outside, but the more we were around him; we just couldn't part with such a cute creature, so we brought him in the house.

Othello became a big part of our family. We planned trips based on whether he was allowed in the hotel (which not very many hotels allow). He ate under the table while we were eating. And we all laughed whenever he made a yap in the middle of our conversation. We all argued every night over who got to sleep with Othello, and contrary to most families, we also argued over who would take him outside to go to the bathroom at night. We even sent him away to a pet spa to relax for a weekend.

Then came the unfortunate day. It was Christmas day. We had just finished opening presents, and we were out in the yard playing with Othello's new ball. We would toss the ball and Othello would dig through the snow and bring it back to us, running at us with a silly grin on his face and his tail wagging. He was even smart enough not to fall for the old snowball trick. We were taking turns throwing the ball to Othello and it was my sister's turn. She threw the ball, but she accidentally slipped and the ball flew into the street. Othello ran out. It was snowy. Plows can't stop very easily. We thought that there was no way that Othello would survive. He had hit the blade and flew high into the air. He tumbled through the air and landed in the snow behind the plow.

We stood there in horror, but luckily the snow was soft. Othello's nose was soon visible above the snow bank. He was alive! We were ecstatic. We thought we had lost our best friend. Othello dug himself out from the bank and stood on top of it triumphantly. We all called him over to us, rejoicing at his good luck. He started running. He was half way across the road when a teenage driver hit him.

And that night Othello served his original purpose. We had pork chops for dinner.

September 2016,23,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/23/hypnosis/,"September 2016, 23",Hypnosis,"I'm a hypnotist. Yes, really. A lot of people have a lot of misconceptions about hypnosis, so I thought I'd clear up a few things.

1. Hypnosis is a real thing. It has been extensively studied, documented, and scientifically verified. Do some Google searches for scientific papers about hypnosis, if you want more proof.

2. Most of what you've seen in movies and on TV about hypnosis is wrong. A hypnotist can't hypnotize you just by looking into your eyes, snapping his fingers, etc. You can't be hypnotized against your will. You can't use hypnosis to force someone to do something they don't want to do. Hypnosis is not about ""taking control"" of another person.

3. Hypnosis sounds like mystical, voodoo stuff, but it's not. A hypnotic trance is simply a state of deep, intense focus, similar to meditation. Nothing more, nothing less. That means that anyone can be hypnotized, including you.

4. Most people go into and out of light hypnotic trance every day. Have you ever had the experience of watching a good movie, or reading a good book, where you got ""sucked in"" and stopped noticing anything else going on in the room around you? And afterwards, you're surprised by how much time has passed, because it didn't feel like as long as it was? That's a hypnotic trance. That's not like a trance, that is a trance.

5. It's impossible to be ""trapped"" in a trance. When you are hypnotized, you can stop at any time, just like you can stop watching an engaging movie at any time. However, like watching an engaging movie, being hypnotized is a very relaxing and enjoyable experience, so unless something happens that makes you nervous or uncomfortable, you probably won't stop until you're done.

6. Like anything else, being hypnotized is a skill. As you get more practice with it, you'll be able to go into deeper trances, which can have stronger and more long-lasting effects. Even if you have a lot of practice going into trance, you'll only go as deep as you feel comfortable going -- if you're in an unfamiliar situation, or working with an unfamiliar hypnotist, you won't go as deep.

7. One of the properties of a trance state is ""heightened suggestibility"". This means that if an idea is suggested to you, you are far more likely to serious consider and potentially accept the idea, rather than just brushing it off and discarding it. This is why watching a good movie can provoke intense emotions. Intellectually, you know that you're watching actors on a set reading a script. But because of heightened suggestibility, you're willing to accept the idea that these characters are real, their struggles are real, and they deserve your sympathy and support. ""Heightened suggestibility"" does not mean that you will think or do whatever you're told: if a movie suggests that anyone watching it will murder their loved ones, you might get a bit creeped out, but you won't actually follow the suggestion.

8. I often get asked if you remember what happened after a hypnosis session. This forgetting is called ""post-hypnotic amnesia"", and it can happen, but it's rare. It only happens after a very deep hypnosis session, so it won't happen the first time you do it. It happens when the conscious mind doesn't want to hold onto what the subconscious mind is experiencing, similar to suppressing painful memories.

If you want to know more, search for my website: ""Quiet Strength Hypnosis"". I'm happy to chat and answer questions!

We were visiting family friends, just the two of us, leaving my dad and brothers behind. My mom turned to me and said, ""I'm so excited! This is the first time I'm traveling without your dad or my parents.""

Her comment floored me. My strong, seemingly independent, no bullshit-taking mom had never traveled on her own before?

She died when I was 17. I have no doubt that I wouldn't be the strong, independent, still working on the no bullshit-taking-thing, woman I am today without her being such a model of it herself. 

As for the travel thing, I thrive on pushing myself out of my comfort zone through new experiences. I just returned from a ten day trip to Rwanda (the people are wonderful and the land is beautiful!). 

Everyone should take a solo travel trip at least once in their lives. Can be domestic or international. Traveling alone makes you realize just how much you can rely on yourself. 

Something I'm Working On: Being less independent and asking for help more often.--

I was recently sitting in an airport, and three men sat across from me decked out in some expensive looking jewelry. As soon as they sat down, I had a feeling they were famous, but I had no clue who they were. My feeling was confirmed when people periodically would approach them, asking for photos. After taking a photo for a woman who approached the men, I asked the one closest to me, ""So, uh, what do you guys do?""

He said, ""We're in music...""

""Oh, music?"" I responded.

""Yeah... G-Unit.""

I was sitting across from 3/4 of the rap group G-Unit.--

Please send me book (and travel) recommendations! Currently into sci-fi and non-fiction. 

I just moved to Chicago and would love recommendations of non-touristy things to experience! 

Or send me anything else you'd like!

September 2016,21,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/21/lets-talk-about-universal-basic-income/,"September 2016, 21",Let’s Talk About Universal Basic Income,"I can’t say I was expecting this: last time I won the listserve lottery, I wrote about how lucky I was to have been chosen only three years after joining. That was 15 months ago, and I assure you: the chance of winning twice in 4.5 years is even lower than winning once in three.

I won’t spend all my time again talking about luck, though. Instead, let’s talk about work. Why do you work? To earn the money to survive, right? Except it’s patently obvious that when some people inherit billions through no better quality than luck, and others spend their entire working lives doing jobs they hate because for whatever reason they can’t make a living doing something they enjoy, something is wrong with the system.

A Universal Basic Income seems like it could be the solution. If the poverty line in the US is $12,300 or so, what would happen if you scrapped all current social programs and simply gave every US citizen $12,500 every year?

In short, it wouldn’t work yet. That expense alone would cost something like 4 trillion dollars; the entire US Federal budget for 2014 was only 3.5 trillion. You would totally eliminate poverty, but you would likely crash the economy--there are still plenty of low-wage jobs out there which can’t yet be done by robots, which people still take because their option is to work there or starve. If people knew they wouldn’t starve even if they just lazed in their underwear and watched TV all day, it would take a much higher salary to convince them to, say, get out in the fields and pick fruit all day. This in turn would raise the price of fruit etc. dramatically.

Still, it’s a beautiful dream, and in an increasingly automated world, it’s one to keep an eye on. The promise is not simply to completely eliminate poverty, but to significantly increase wage equality. Some jobs are simply fun to do; there are people passionate about teaching, programming, engineering, and many other fields. Those positions won’t suffer under UBI. However, very few people have a true passion for being the graveyard shift clerk in a 24-hour gas station on the highway. Those sort of positions will simply have to automate, or pay more in order to stay staffed--a win for wage equality no matter how you cut it. In the meantime, you can expect a flowering of artistry and entrepreneurialism, as millions of people whose time had been consumed by jobs they hated now have the opportunity to do what they really wanted with their lives.

Within 20 years there will be no more truckers; as self-driving trucks catch on, those jobs will cease to exist. They won’t be the last field to be automated out of existence, either. Retraining after middle age is unlikely, and retiring too early is a huge financial risk. Do we just cast the affected individuals to the wind? I’d hope not. I’d dearly love to see a UBI worked out within my lifetime. What it really comes down to is what you want for your children: do only millionaires’ kids get to follow their passions, or should everyone’s?

In the meantime, I’m following my own passions, working as a freelance programmer. If you need a backend expert in Python or Rust, do get in touch!

Finally, US people: make sure you’re registered to vote, and then go do it. Please. Even if you disagree with my politics, voting is the only effective way you have to express that, other than significant political donations.

September 2016,20,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/20/it-happened-in-the-frozen-food-aisle/,"September 2016, 20",It Happened In The Frozen Food Aisle,"It happened in the frozen food section at my parent’s local supermarket. She could no longer keep up niceties. She was a woman melting down because she just wanted a frozen dessert. Cancer got the best of her while standing in front of the ice cream looking for Neapolitan.

Right there in aisle 5, sat a tragically beautiful woman. I was helpless to give her ice cream, or more time, or any answers about what was happening to her, but I had, in a heartbeat, grown into the daughter who could hold her and bear compassionate witness to the remainder of her life. And that's what I did.

My mother had advanced colon cancer. A surgery performed in an attempt to remove the cancer resulted in the need for a colostomy bag. There would be rounds of radiation treatment and chemotherapy to follow.

The cancer marched on, breaching boundaries and moving into her liver where it would take her life. But not before she could find purpose in cancer by agreeing to be a part of research. She was, as I remember it, part of an early trial group using a chemo-pump. The pump was a 4"" x 8"" device she wore in a fanny pack around her waist. It connected to a treatment port in her chest. With the pump, her treatment was delivered more slowly with less side effects and it allowed for fewer trips to the cancer center. Cancer also played to her strengths as a natural and gifted teacher. She began volunteering to help other people with colostomy bags learn to take care of themselves.

The way my mother negotiated cancer taught me there is no part of my person or my challenges too awful that it can't be used as a meaningful path to service. I saw I only needed to play to my strengths to face my fears or shortcomings. Anything I’m willing to face becomes a means to be of service.

Before my mother’s diagnosis I had little confidence in myself or anything I did. I repeatedly sabotaged my efforts and opportunities. But from the melt down to her death bed, my mother’s examples saved my life.

Two weeks after laying her to rest, I returned to college at age 32, to complete my undergraduate degree. I went from dropout to graduating magna cum laude. I continued my education to become the first legally blind visual artist to receive an MFA from the University of Michigan.

Every step of the way I used (and still use) challenges and character defects as the compost for my strengths to find ways to grow possibilities I share with others. I created my business, ProNagger, out of my own challenges. I started ProNagger because I know there are people, like me, who have valuable things to offer and can’t get them done and/or out into the world because of some type of emotional paralysis. The same kind of paralysis that once crippled me more than any visual impairment could. Please don’t let anything cripple you too. We need your special kind of goodness in the world.

Warmly,

Rachel Z CornellCurrently in Michigan, in the United States

PS: While I was writing this email, a friend, the beautifully honest poet, Ilyse Kusnetz passed away. I’m crying as I type this. Her most recent works integrate love and cancer and dying into brilliant poems and prose, because writing was her strength. Her words will resonate in hearts and minds forever."
September 2016,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/19/keep-moving/,"September 2016, 19",Keep Moving,"This past spring, my younger son and his girlfriend took a trip to the Smoky Mountains where they rented a place and went hiking during the day. 

About a week after they got back home, the two of them, along with my older son, came over for dinner and I was excited to hear the details of their trip.  They loved it, of course, and then told me that their first day out they asked a ranger for some help, and misunderstanding them (I guess), he sent them out on a much longer trail than they had inquired about. They walked for what felt like forever when my son said he was worried they'd be losing light soon.  And then he noticed a bear print on a large rock, bent down and found it was still wet. At this point his girlfriend said, ""I'm exhausted and there's a bear near us and I feel like crying"", to which he calmly replied, ""It's okay to cry, but you have to keep moving.""

I've survived emotional abuse growing up, divorce, the loss of friends that can happen when you divorce, the deaths of people who were very important to me, and stage 1 non-Hodgkins lymphoma.  Throughout all of these challenges in life, the best advice I've gotten can be summed up in that simple phrase, ""It's okay to cry, but you have to keep moving.""  

What I've learned is that:

99% of the things we worry about never happen.99% of the things that do happen are never as bad as we feared they would be.It's the challenges that teach us and improve us - as long as we're committed to being better and not bitter human beings.  

It's okay to cry, but you have to keep moving.

When I'm not reading your emails I conduct a Management Training Class for companies around the country.  I'm also a published author.

Is anyone else ever so taken by a Listserve contribution that you take a peek at the writers photo on LinkedIn so you can put a face to the font?  There should be a word for that.

September 2016,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/18/my-life-as-a-photograph/,"September 2016, 18",My Life as a Photograph,"This is a picture of a growing city. In the foreground you can see a fading memory of the old green hills and a single browning patch of grass. Further in the distance, you see the solitary sliver of Golden Gate Park, desperately holding on to a city that is slowly being taken over by a new generation of San Franciscans.  These changes aren’t bad; they are solely the next chapter in the extremely long life of this ever-changing city.  There is a tendency among landscape photographers to edit out the “human world”, leaving only greens and browns of the “natural world”.  But this photo would not be anything without the orange lights or the pastel blur of the hundreds of 20th century homes.

When I was in 6th grade, I was diagnosed with dyslexia. After my family discovered this, I was faced with the very difficult decision to either stay with my friends at my current school--where I would undoubtedly struggle through the rest of middle school, or to go to a new school where I would receive the help I needed.  I didn’t want to think of myself as an outsider who needed help.  I didn’t want to be a “weirdo”(!).  After a lot of tears, and going back and forth, we decided that I would move to the Charles Armstrong School (CAS) which specializes in teaching students with learning differences (LDs).  When I moved to CAS, I immediately felt accepted and understood.  To my surprise, the students weren’t “weirdos”, but interesting, smart people from many different backgrounds.  The teachers immediately engaged me in educating me on my learning differences.  Everything started to make sense.  The blurry picture of myself suddenly started to come into focus, and I began to see more clearly who I was and how I learned.  My new teachers taught me to not only accept and cope with my LDs but to embrace them and use them to my advantage.  I had been struggling in school at the fault of a learning difference I wasn’t even aware I had.  I realized why at my previous school it had been so difficult for me to succeed; I was tempted to erase my past and wipe out the flawed, blurry image of myself.  I just wanted to move forward.  But later I learned that wiping out the past is not so simple.  A blurry and imperfect photo, seen in a new light, can become calming and grounding.  Recently, I heard a teenager who had also had a rough time in school say, “it’s not about forgetting the past, it’s just about forgiving the past.”

Just as a photographer criticizes a photograph, you must learn how to criticize yourself and see what you are doing wrong.  But a photographer can also see the potential in a photograph.  You have to learn to accept the flaws in an image, and see the beauty in oneself. The goal isn’t always to take a different photo, it is to take a better one.  Instead of trying to change yourself entirely, you should improve. So, like the picture of this landscape, I have grown up, in a world full of change and innovation, and instead of attempting to edit out the flaws within myself, I simply change the composition of my picture. This makes the flaws a feature that can evolve into something greater. People don’t hang perfect photographs on their walls. The few perfect photographs that exist are preserved by museum curators. So, neither you nor your photographs nor your art need to be perfect.  I’ve learned people much prefer a picture with flaws, a history and meaning to one that is flawless, “perfect” and bland.

September 2016,17,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/17/my-five-most-life-altering-moments/,"September 2016, 17",My five most life-altering moments,"In chronological order:

1. The drummer from the high school band, a fellow sophomore named Garrett, approached me at lunch to ask if I wanted to get together and play some music that weekend. He knew that in addition the trumpet and keyboard I played in the school band, I also played guitar and sang, and we had chatted about both liking Pink Floyd. That weekend we began a lifelong friendship, and two lifelong band careers. Together we formed the first student-run rock band my high school had ever had, pretentiously named Sound And Fury, after the Macbeth quote our English teacher had just had us memorize. We recruited our friend Rudi, a clarinetist who I taught to play bass using on a fretboard diagram I drew for him on a coffee shop napkin. With the support of the school—and particularly the awesome and extremely progressive librarian—we played school events every few weeks, about half classic rock covers and half originals. I learned partnership and teamwork, developed my musical and leadership chops, discovered songwriting, marketing, and what it is to front a band. I found a voice I didn’t know I had.

2. I said “One, two, FIVE”, and heard a girl standing nearby reply “Three sir!”—a Monty Python reference, if you aren’t aware. This was the week before classes started, my freshman year of college. I’ve now been married to that girl for just over 21 years. We’ve grown together into very different people who still somehow manage to still complement, support, and deeply love each other after all this time.

3. I sat in a room with about 80 other people confronting all the meaning and significance I have added to this utterly insignificant thing called life, as I participated in a course called The Landmark Forum. I walked into this one-weekend course skeptical and defensive and pretty certain about how life “is"", and I walked out able to actually HEAR people’s communication for the first time in my life, and with the blinders truly off about what could be possible. No part of my life was left unaltered. I became the agent of change in my own life, and a voice for what is possible for those around me. In the 17 years since that weekend, no single event has altered my trajectory as utterly as doing the Forum did. (I’m not an employee or stakeholder with Landmark, just a profoundly grateful and satisfied customer who can’t recommend it highly enough. I think everyone owes it to themselves to at find out about it and see if it’s for them.)

4. I told a woman that I liked very much that my wife and I had discussed it, and that we felt we had room for her in our lives. After confirming this with my wife, she began with us a discussion of how this would look and work, which culminated in her moving in with us in early January of 2007. The three of us had a commitment ceremony a couple years later (which we’ll call life-altering event #4.5) in front of about 80 people, including members of all three families. I now live with both of the the loves of my life.

5. I held my five-minute-old daughter in my arms. I had expected, in that moment, to MEET her. To finally get to see her and know her after all this waiting. What I was unprepared for was that there was NOTHING there. A great big empty slate of pure wide-open unwritten future, that she gets to spend her life filling in. I’d literally never had the experience of meeting a human with NO way that they are. She wasn’t any way, she didn’t have any properties; she just WAS. It was the most shocking and unsettling and profound experience of my life.

It’s awesome to share a bit of my life with the Listserve community, and a privilege to be invited to do so!

Now a favor to ask! I’m starting up a new band in the Triad area of North Carolina, called the Disaster Recovery Band—a cover/party band with an emphasis on quality, high-energy music and crowd engagement, including some live-band karaoke. We lean toward classic rock, but our repertoire includes last week’s hits. If you’re in central NC and have any kind of corporate event, party, club, wedding, bar mitzvah, festival, fun run, food truck rally, or other sort of thing that could use a super fun party band to liven it up, please check us out and consider us for it. You can find us by searching Facebook for “Disaster Recovery Band”. A link to our website is on the “About” tab.

Thanks!

September 2016,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/16/on-planning/,"September 2016, 16",On Planning,"I am an expert planner (self-proclaimed).  I’ve been in training since I was a little thing.   When my parents woke me in the morning, I would ask for the day’s plan before I even opened my eyes.   By my freshman year of high school, I had it all figured out.  I would spend the next few years beefing up my resume with the clear intent of getting a scholarship to play tennis at TCU, majoring in marketing, and then landing a killer job in the fashion industry.

Well, plans change.

My headaches came on quickly and were getting worse.  I had imaging studies instead of playing my district tennis match, which seemed like the end of the world.  The next day, the doctor put the MRI film on the viewer and we all stared.  There was a tumor on my brain stem and I was scheduled for surgery in 2 weeks.

I kept planning.  I planned like my life wouldn’t be forever changed.  My parents paid for summer camp because I was so certain that I would be on the bus with everyone else in a month.  I went to tennis practice and begged my coach to let me keep practicing, since I would be just fine in no time!  I seemed to be the only one who believed that everything would go back to normal as soon as they removed that pesky little tumor.

The surgery went well, and the tumor was benign.  The right side of my face lost movement, my eye wouldn’t close, and I couldn’t swallow.  I was in the hospital for 2 weeks relearning to walk, getting my pain under control, and creating a new plan.

I never stopped making new plans.   Even though I could walk, my tennis career had to go.   I started playing golf.  Since I wasn’t going to get a tennis scholarship at TCU, I worked on my application to Texas A&M.  Accounting was not my friend (I’m sure this is not related to the tumor), so I changed majors and started another new plan.

I’ll graduate as a Family Nurse Practitioner 13 years and 5 days after my original plans changed forever.  One might note that the medical field and the fashion industry are a bit different...

Plans change.  Go with it.  Keep making new ones.  Who knows?  The revised version may be even better than the original.

I have many memories of people that have sprinkled my life with kindness - family, friends, strangers and locals. I think those experiences makes me a more kind person.

Tonight I am surrounded by family and friends that have supported me through many good and many tough times. They have kept me from wallowing in my own negative history and provided many experiences of kindness to help heal the wounds.  The kind memories are what I WANT to filter.  As an ambivert (google it, it’s a thing) I often need time to myself to think and process.  Even when I am in that mode, whether literal or simply known in my heart, I know that my friends and family “get me” and support me.

It is often hard to balance the need/want to be out and about with the necessary time to reserve my energy.  Over the last two months, I have worked a full time paying job, completed a significant volunteer project, fit in two short vacations to refuel, and managed to somehow remember to nourish myself and my cat.  This is not unique to just me.  We all face the pressure to do it all and be everything to everyone.

Through all of that I’ve learned the following:-          Sometimes “I can’t.” is the right answer.

-          Sometimes “I can’t” is the wrong answer.

-          Most of the time you won’t know which is which.

-          I have broken, burned, built and rebuilt bridges in the process.

-          Found new inner strength that I hope will push me into finding:

o   a new career, life purpose, and rekindling the relationship that took quite the ride (some good, mostly bad) in the whole process and deserves much respect and time to heal.

To best sum it up, when life sets you up to knock out a home run, take the chance but don’t forget to manage your relationships along the way.  Be kind.  Be human.  Be loving.  Be honest to yourself most of all. In doing all of that, remembering the positive memories, is only remembering, and not filtering.

They’re not sending you.  They’re sending emails that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems to you.  They’re bringing spam.  They’re bringing preachiness.  They’re bringing pseudo-intellectualism.  And some, I assume, are good emails.""

Just kidding Listservians.  I now know firsthand how difficult it is to come up with something creative and original.  I actually have been really impressed with the emails I have received from The Listserve.  So many have shared personal and sometimes painful stories, and I really appreciate the courage and effort people have shown.

I am a 43 year-old attorney living in Maryland.  I run an ediscovery law firm, and write sometimes entertaining blog posts about it.

I spend my time hanging out with my family, cheering on the Terps, eating nachos, watching TV, botching crossfit, and reading.

Some of my personal highlights since 2008:

• 9/25/08:  I knew that my son dropped his toothbrush down the drain, but was surprised when the plumber found FIVE toothbrushes down there.

• 12/9/08:  I’m at the shopping center watching two kids get arrested. I think I just saw the cops plant some evidence.

• 12/25/08:  At Lion Country Safari. Ostriches are feisty.

• 5/30/09:  Just had an ostrich burger (vengeance is sweet!)

• 12/8/09:  A woman on the metro told me that her son was reading the same book as me. Then she told me he was in the 4th grade.

• 3/3/10:  Going to my 21st Maryland-Duke game.

• 3/30/10:  Just got a Kindle! No more nosey metro ladies mocking my reading level.

• 9/3/10:  The mean camp won in Camp Rock 2? Most disappointing movie ending since Rocky I.

• 12/6/10:  I have a favorite Jonas Brother : (

• 2/5/11:  The opening scene of The King's Speech was completely ripped off from 8 Mile.

• 2/9/11:  I'm at my first concert since Public Enemy in 1991 (Miranda Cosgrove).

• 8/30/12:  Happy 103rd Birthday to my beloved Grandma Esther!

• 11/22/12:  This Thanksgiving, I am so thankful for my wonderful friends and family. I am also thankful for my 1999 fantasy football championship, omelets with pastrami inside, Carly Rae Jepsen, nfl redzone, Amy Farrah Fowler, Facebook' s ability to allow me to minimize actual human interaction, the entire cast of ICarly, Stefon Diggs, Stefon Urkel, extra-large kindle font, Hard Times Cafe wings and chili.

• 12/23/12:  Sad that our awesome au pair is going home to visit her family for Christmas. Happy that I don't have to wear pants in the house for the next 10 days.

• 3/8/13:  I got my favorite seat on the metro : ) I have a favorite seat on the metro : (

• 11/17/13:  Terp game with me, the boy, and President Obama.

• 9/16/14:  I don't normally like to do stuff, but I'm pretty psyched to be going to see Aziz Ansari tomorrow night with my wife.

• 8/8/15 Just finished the 15 book Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. It was kind of meh.

• 10/3/15:  Per Facebook memories, I had a carvel football cake on my Birthday for the 5th straight year.

September 2016,12,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/12/turning-my-lego-passion-into-a-living/,"September 2016, 12",Turning my LEGO passion into a living,"Maybe everyone had this idea: Quit your job and make a living from whatever you like best. Many people like their comfort zone, though they don’t give it a try. I like my comfort zone too, but I try nonetheless… I have not quit my job (yet) but reduced it to a bearable minimum to be able to turn my LEGO passion into a business.

LEGO business? What? How?

A year ago, I started my venture: The qlib. The qlib is a giant LEGO brick that you can just clip onto IKEA furniture. I built those for my study once (google „besta lego shelves“ to check it out) but never thought about bringing the idea to the market. However, when my daughter was born 18 months ago, and I looked at kids furniture, everything was so uninspired, colorless and sterile. That’s when I sat down with some friends, and we developed the product.

It took half a year to get everything done from development to a marketing plan. In April we turned to Kickstarter, but the ‚community‘ didn’t catch on and our manufacturer let us down, so we stopped the campaign before it even begun.

I want my blankie!!

When you have worked so many nights to get it all done and it doesn’t go as planned, that is exactly the point when you want to go back to your comfort zone. You suddenly notice how much time and money you invested and start thinking that is was all a bad idea. You start to question everything - the idea, the team, the business plan, the marketing strategy, the whole damn project.

Luckily, I didn’t do this alone. The whole team pushed me to develop plan B with them and we did. That’s what friends are for. That’s why you shouldn’t do this alone.

Will we make a living out of it?

I would love to end this story with a success, but we’re not quite there yet. We have a new manufacturer, even better prototypes, and we are getting ready to restart the crowdfunding in November.

I don’t think this will be our breakthrough (unless IKEA wants to integrate the qlib into their product range...), but we will continue nonetheless. It’s been a great journey so far, we all learned so much and we are doing this to get the full experience from the development process to the market.

I’m certain that we’ll create our own comfort zone, better than the one we’re in at the moment. We have a ton of ideas and once we have the qlib venture up and running, we won’t go back to where we started, but to the next (ad)venture!

I would love to hear from you!

Have you tried something similar? Succeeded? Failed? Do you like the story and want to know how it will go on? Any other suggestions, ideas or experience you want to share?

All the best

September 2016,11,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/11/jesus-was-an-astral-traveller/,"September 2016, 11",Jesus was an Astral Traveller,"“And that’s what the Bible is: an astral story; a very groovy astral story, at one level anyway. It’s a good astral story, but illusions are illusions.”

I saw that printed on a poster for a show here in town several years ago, and it made me chuckle so I wrote it down. I like it because it unifies what I perceive as the wisdom of the ancient mystics with the revelatory cynicism of the Post-Modern realist. Following this metaphysical thread, I want to use this opportunity to contribute what could only be the most trite, prosaic, and insufferable Listserve topic available: my take on the Meaning of Life.

As of Right Now, I perceive reality as a high precision mirror, reflecting to each of us, literally and metaphorically, who we really are. Further, our emotional reactions to these perceived impressions, memories, and thoughts intend to facilitate our self-remembering and the expansion of our consciousness--to show ourselves to ourselves. Further still, we are indistinguishable from all in the mirror that we perceive, but more on that in a minute.

As fragments of a singular Consciousness, I believe that we are the means in which Source Energy creates itself and knows itself. This quest(ion?) isn't best addressed through the pursuit and attainment of material objects, physical attractiveness, superficial pleasures, or in some cases, even knowledge. More so, presence to the direct experience of what is happening now, whether in our relationships, desires, dramas, beliefs, or recurring events, can effectively lead us to discover what is necessary for our soul’s expansion.

As active participants in a dualistic and relativistic universe, no object, thought, or event has any fixed reality--even consensus reality can shift if brought about by the collective’s consciousness. Modern physicists have discovered activity within the atom clearly mimicking the activity within our minds, in that the intent of the individual determines the existence and behavior of particles. As to whether we can assume that macroscopic reality mirrors the subatomic, I turn to the timeless statement first written on the Emerald Tablet of Hermes Trismegistus, ""As above, so below.”

Perhaps less aligned with modes testable under our current scientific method, many attest to the relevance of dimensions beyond the three in which we are familiar. Three-dimensional reality possesses the basic qualities of time, space and matter, thereby creating the experiences of separation, death and mass/volume. It has been proposed that we enter the fourth dimension when we dream or when folks with the capacity, travel astrally. The fourth dimension and higher are said to allow a stronger perception of pure energy, unity, and soul, accompanied by the omnipresence of eternity, where past and future simultaneously co-exist in the eternal moment of Now. And the interplay of all dimensions is happening Now; as just like in the case of the aforementioned hypothetical mirror, there is no such thing as distinction.

I know much of this sounds like a bunch of uncitable, woo-woo, New Age mumbo-jumbo, which in a sense, it is. But I also think that we only have such nonsensical words to describe similarly esoteric concepts because we don’t yet have language available to us to describe them.  As a mere fractal of this whole beautiful mess, I know that if theories such as these struck the fancy of an ordinary, introspective seeker like myself, there are those out there with inklings of the same! Regardless, please feel free to let me know how it has impacted you, if you feel so inclined!

Winning the list serve was no surprise.  It was the final piece of recovery from my darkest hours yet.  There are no coincidences.

3 years ago I met the love of my life.  Shy yet intrigued, I mustered the courage to introduce myself.  We took it slow, dates, art shows, eventually intimacy.  Casual but fantastic.  More time together, a Polish Ambassador concert and the most passionate night of our lives.

She is the one.

But I have past loves, mentally unstable,  poly-amorous, and a terrible communicator.  She wants commitment, I agree.  But my past still resides inside.  I cheat, but come clean.  She is rightfully upset, almost breaks it off,  yet forgives me, we heal.

She is the one.

We move to Seattle, find a dream house.  Work comes slow, we scrape by.  She grows her art, I land a “dream job” hosting Cannabis events. February 2015, I am DJing a set atop the Vegas strip, schmoozing with Tommy Chong and the founder of Instagram.

“We have made it” I think to myself.

But, long hours, a sociopath boss, agressive roommates, past loves, little focus on grounding ourselves.  She grows wary, I am convinced it will work  She intuits the coming crisis, yet remains supportive.

After weeks of 18 hour days, I have my first ever manic episode.  Blurry vision, vomiting,  thoughts so dark even George Carlin and Kung-Fu Panda can’t free me from despair.  Awake for days, we decide to head home to the Midwest.

Summer 2015, Convinced I have failed us, I search for meaning.  She meets another love at a festival, I am devastated and vow to change, she believes in me, we are together again.  I get back on my feet; work, therapy, medication.  Our lease expires, we find separate housing.  On and off in the fall, love and passion, yet anger and uncertainty.  Winter looms, I find work in Florida.  I don’t want to drag her across the country again,  she stays.  We vow to make it work long distance

Spring 2016. She grows her art, I find an acceptable job and settle into a great routine.  We are both building ourselves, communicating, visiting, the spark remains, this will work, the distance is temporary.

She is the one.

A month ago, she visits, we plan so many things to grow our relationship.  None of them pan out.  We fight, and become nervous around each other.  But plan to get through, we will find a way,

She is the one.

She leaves, off to Colorado to perform and connect with the circus scene.When she returns home, I sense a shift.  2 weeks later, an email hinting at new love and prospects, she’s confused yet certain.

I am manic once again, no food or sleep for days.  My need for answers pushes her away, she asks for space, I can’t comply. Tensions mount, mania expands, I end my Florida life in a week and head home.  That was 3 days ago.  Our future is uncertain,but

She is the one

Her name is Sophie SpaceGypsy an inspiration and beacon of love for the world, and a blossoming circus performer.  She deserves to shine.  Please support her if you can  (@sophiespacegypsy)

I am Dr Beatz (@DrBtz) - an EDM producer with visions of sustainable touring and technological utopia.Hit me up about ANYTHING!!!  Connections are what drive us, art will save us, beauty is everywhere.  I know that because of her.

September 2016,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/09/haunting/,"September 2016, 09",Haunting,"I don't know what my own story is, I'm still working on it. I didn't want to bring myself to write this story but my twin sister Tory reminded me to be brave and she is always right. 

2 years ago I lived in a haunted house on McClellan Ave. with my sister Kylie, her boyfriend Mark and their corgi Finley. They were the perfect little family. The house was a big 3 bedroom with creaky wooden floors and a long dark hallway. The 3rd bedroom had no door and was left unused. Everyday Finley would lay at the entrance and growl at nothing. The ceiling light in that room would always flicker. I started sleeping with a nightlight.The house was the only one on the block with no grass, it never grew despite how much Mark watered and seeded it.He didn't believe in ghosts, he said the dark stains that would appear and then vanish on the hardwood floors were water damage, that the black slugs and small grey flies that would come up from the drains were just an infestation, that the figure of a man he repeated saw in the kitchen was just his imagination. Once when we were sitting at the small dining room table the 4th chair moved back without anyone touching it, like someone we couldn't see had seated themselves for dinner. I felt terrified being alone in the house. Home alone one night the power went out and I was left staring at my own face in my vanity, lit up by my phone. I ran outside with Finley and sat under the street lamp, our house was the only one on the block with no lights on. Taking a shower was a nightmare, the ceiling of the bathroom always had long black strands of hair stuck to it that I would have to brush away with a broom. Once I heard a woman scream from inside my pillow. 

Eventually we moved out into a magnificent brightly lit house only a few blocks away on Oro Ave. It was beautiful with flower bushes and a green yard and I felt like Kylie and Mark had finally gotten the home they deserved. I was scared to live alone but I saved money and got my own apartment. Mark moved all my furniture for me and bought me house warming presents. 3 months ago Mark killed himself in the garage of the house on Oro Ave. Do I think the house on McClellan had anything to do with it? No, of course not.It doesn't bother me to drive by the haunted house we used to live in and it doesn't scare me to think about it, but I won't drive past the house on Oro Ave. 

I am no longer afraid of ghosts, I'm afraid now of much more real things. I'm afraid of someone I care about being relegated to a few descriptive words ""he was funny, smart, creative, kind."" I'm afraid of not getting the chance to let someone know how much they really mean to me.I'm afraid of someone I love becoming a haunted house. I still sleep with a nightlight.

September 2016,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/05/7-days/,"September 2016, 05",7 Days,"A week ago, I went through an amicable yet extremely painful breakup.

We’re young, we were each other’s first significant other, and we had been dating 4 years. She was worried she was missing what else is out there—that she’d be 40 and wake up realizing she’d committed too early. I tried to convince her to stay, but I recognize she’s right, and I’m crazy for being willing to ignore any of those doubts myself.

It doesn’t make it easier to lose her, though. There really is no one else in the world like her.

I know breaking up is the standard stuff of being 20-something, but it’s hard not to feel like it’s exceptional. Maybe that’s just because it’s personal, so I know the all the details of what I’m losing, the small things you usually don’t see in stories, like her calling me excited with moments she can’t wait to share, me sending her goodnight messages, us using silly pet names... There are sad moments where I get excited to tell her something and then remember I can’t.

The past week has been a lot: random memories stabbing at my heart, moments of ridiculous optimism, regret over every time I let her down, an Avett Brothers and Fleetwood Mac playlist, fear of the future, blank stares into space, and reflection on my life.

At this point, I’m becoming okay. All this has also rekindled my spirit. It’s reminded me of all the great things I’m planning to do, but had forgotten being comfortable. Someone a couple years back sent out a message titled “Plan secretly and without respite.” Find the quoted passage online—I’m no anarchist, but that speaks to exactly how I’m feeling.

My new plans are being laid. I know things will be different in the future and they’ll be ok, even if there’s a space left behind. I’m in tech currently, but eventually want to get into storytelling of some kind. Time to start exploring.

For now, though, the roller coaster will continue. I’m visiting our college for a career fair in a couple weeks. I’ll walk past the places where we met, had our first date, had our first kiss. Her ghost will be everywhere. It’ll suck, but it’ll also probably help me find closure to be there alone, remember, and walk away.

--------------------Thanks for reading as I work through all this. I recognize it’s not particularly meaningful to others, but it was helpful for me. It felt right given the timing.

Other Things:

I live in the Bay Area. Hit me up for a drink. I promise I have tons of interesting, other things to talk about when not emailing 20,000 people.

Send me book, movie, & music recommendations! Doesn’t matter what as long as you think it’s interesting and tell me why.

Also, please send me your thoughts, hopes, fears, criticisms, wise words, and startup pitches (just kidding, please not those). The most exciting part of this for me is getting to hear from all you awesome people out there. I'll respond.

Be good to others and yourself.

It's a great honor to get chosen to write for the Listserve. I love hearing all your stories, advice and zests for life. It's a pretty amazing community to be apart of.

I would like to talk to you guys about a positive mindset. It's a practice that I find defines my life. It's about waking up each day and saying ""hey, I'm alive and nothing can bring me down because guess what I'm breathing."" These are some of the things that I do in order to keep that mindset grooving and you should too! Smile at people. Laugh at your own weird thoughts. Say hi to dogs on the street, stop to smell the flowers, lay in the grass, say hi to strangers as well, look at tough times as ways to improve your mindset and make yourself wiser, shout!, sing at the top of your lungs, don't wait to do something if you can honestly get it done today and out of the way, send mail the old fashioned way, enjoy the ride instead of waiting to get somewhere, dance if you feel like dancing, have a yin and yang with your health and vices and finally follow what makes you happy. I left my family and friends behind in Chicago to follow my now husband to California and it has made me a lover of adventure. I hope you all enjoy this wonderful and weird time we all have on this green and blue marble. Love is all you need!

Oh! I'm also trying to become a better reader...if you have a book that changed your life feel free to email me the title!

Or a Reason to Meet in Chicago Over Cheese,"It's not often the average person gets a second chance at winning. Well, I guess I am no longer average. Because this is the second time that I have won the drawing for the Listserve.

The last time I heard from Zena Koo, I was in NYC on holiday in 2015 when I wrote about being single and accidentally exposing myself to the guy that took me to a pool hall for an online date. I received an overwhelming amount of responses, from men, women. Single. Dating. Near and far. I even received offers for dates. On Skype. In person. Via email. Then there were the people who asked me to write guest posts on their blogs. And those that wrote email exchanges lasted for days at a time. It was a joy to read other stories from people, but then I got too busy. Busy with the New Year. Busy with the rest of my life. Graduate school started again, deprioritizing anything beyond a hundred mile radius. I didn't make time to update my blog. Didn't add the new subscribers from the Listserve readership who requested updates about my life. Readers were gracious enough to visit my blog. Thousands of views on my site dropped to dozens. An opportunity lost to share more comedy, to nurture new relationships, and to potentially fall in. Out. And back into love.

Over the last twenty months, I thought about how I had potentially squandered something great. How I had not done enough to keep a unique experience alive. I thought about it in the shower. On a trip I had taken this summer to Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe and Iceland. There were many new unique moments, like thinking I would die from being stung by a jellyfish in the Philippines, skimming my knee in Myanmar on my first ever motorbike ride, staring at hot Irish guys with man buns, and looking for remnants of Thor in glaciers and cliffs. Despite all of that, I still daydreamed about what if I the Listserve to do all over again. What would I have done?

With that, I propose a challenge. MEET ME AND MY COVERED BOSOMS IN CHICAGO for the Grate Cheese Caper of 2016. A picnic where we feast on cheese. If you don't eat cheese, bring fancy crackers, If you don't eat crackers, bring wine. And if you don't consume any of those delicious treats, we may have to have a soul reflection together where I better understand your hesitation for joy and grateness. In the meantime, grab your blanket and head to the destination below. Rain or shine.

September 2016,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/09/01/because-life-isnt-traumatic-enough/,"September 2016, 01",Because life isn’t traumatic enough.,"I was not at all surprised to win The Listserve. In fact, I have been contemplating removing myself to avoid the eventuality. I don’t have anything to say. I don’t have any advice. I’m 27 and still figuring life out. They suggest sharing a story so…

Growing up I thought that 17 was a magical number. It was the age at which I would grow out of my gawkiness, be free of my braces, and finally bloom into this beautiful being that novels and movies kept insisting was a part of my future. I couldn’t wait!

The magical day came and I spent it like many other 17 year olds: at the mall shopping. My phone rang and it was my mom, who I was supposed to meet for dinner later to celebrate after I had finish shopping with my dad (my parents were divorced).  Instead of the “Happy Birthday Sweetie!” I was expecting, she rushed to ask where I was, who I was with, and told me not to come home. Her voice sounded strained and on the verge of tears. I asked her what was going on and if she was ok. She said everything would be fine, but to stay with my dad at the mall, don't come, and to please pass the phone to my father. I reluctantly agreed.

That night my mom came to my dads house, face pale, eyes puffy from crying. She sat on the edge of my bed holding my hand. There was a long, pregnant pause.  She said she didn’t know how to tell me, but… my aunt was gone.

She had been murdered.

As my mom burst into tears and embraced me I sat there shocked. But we had just seen her on Christmas 4 days before. But…murdered? This doesn’t happen to regular families. And it definitely doesn’t happen on your 17th birthday. But it had. The reality sunk in and over the course of the next few days detailed emerged.

She had been at a party with a mixed crowd. She had always been outspoken and that night she had irked some gang member. When he pulled a gun on her she asked, “What are you gonna do, shoot me?!”  As she laughed, he pulled the trigger.

I loved watching murder mysteries and cop shows growing up. Those shows always show such clear lines. Bag guy and victim. But who was who in this episode? Recently in recovery from drug addiction we weren’t sure if she’d been using again. What about the other guy? Why was she even there? Would she still be alive if someone had called for an ambulance sooner?

This year will be the 10th anniversary of her death. Most of those questions remain unanswered yet I realize that it doesn’t matter. What matters is that my mom’s best friend and the woman who had helped raise her, the woman who gave me chocolate for breakfast and taught me how to hike is gone. And that each year on my birthday my mom is torn apart by the grief that fills her, and the obligation to feel joy and celebrate the birth of her only child.

August 2016,31,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/08/31/how-i-scarred-my-doll/,"August 2016, 31",How I scarred my doll,"When I got it for my birthday I was told it was a doll for boys. For me it didn’t matter if dolls were for boys or girls. I just knew I liked mine. It was special to me. It had a small red nose, freckles, a soft cotton body and a plastic head with a beautiful smile. The kind of smile that is not too obvious, but modest and reassuring. My grandmother used to make clothes for it. Pretty woolen clothes that made me think of the warm clothes she made for me. It was the first thing that I ever named and took care of. Every evening it sat in my room and watched over me while I went to sleep.

As I grew older I started to notice that the combination of having a doll and being a boy was looked upon as strange. Something I obviously didn’t want to be. I still liked my doll but I was really scared about what my friends and other people would say if they would find out. He was my first real secret. As friends stayed over I would hide him in the closet. After they left I took him out again and tell him I was very sorry. This worked out pretty well for my doll and me until one day I forgot to put him in the closet.

The boy that came over for our play date was very loud scared me a bit. He always wanted to play war or throw stuff. I did not really like him, but he asked my mom and me to come over so many times, I finally said yes. The day he came to my house he was even more hyperactive than usual. He was throwing toys around and I just wanted him to leave. When my mother got enough of the yelling, running and throwing she said we should go upstairs and play in my room. As he went up the stairs towards my bedroom I just hoped his father would come to pick him up quickly.

I followed him into my room and before I knew it he was holding my doll. He held him upside-down and said it was the stupidest doll he had ever seen. I was so ashamed for the fact that he saw that I had a doll, that I told him it was my sisters. To make sure he would believe me I said I didn’t like it and thought dolls were stupid. After that remark he started to throw him around.

I could hear the sound his head made when it hit my bed, my desk and finally the stairs. All the way down. I watched and tried to fake a smile. “This doll is so stupid, look at its silly red nose, and look at its stupid clothes”. I nodded. I felt like the weakest person in the world. After a while he got bored of throwing it around. I hoped he would quit, but he didn’t. Instead he got a green marker and started to draw a moustache on his face, I just watched.

His father finally came to pick him up. They left and I just felt incredibly sorry. I immediately tried to wash of the moustache using a big white towel. The towel was getting greener every time I wiped his face, but one green stripe just didn’t come off. No matter how hard I would rub the towel against the shiny plastic. I promised myself I would never be this weak again. It was his first scar. He still smiled.

Whether you live in a place that experiences frequent droughts or one that floods, it makes sense to conserve water that can be used for growing plants and other purposes later on. In some places like New York City, where I live, there is the unfortunate phenomenon of combined sewer overflow (CSO), in which heavy rainfalls overwhelm the sewer systems, creating large amounts of pollution in the city's waterways. Simply put, if more people were able to responsibly harvest rainwater through well-designed catchment systems, then less water would be flooding the streets and sewers. I also believe urban planners and politicians should be working on legislation to create clear guidelines and incentives for implementing effective rainwater catchment systems. A good guide about rainwater harvesting is on the GrowNYC website.

About me: I am an urban planner in Brooklyn who has been painting a lot in the last few months. You can see some of my paintings on instagram @ smodigliani. Right now I like painting strange shoes! I want to create children's books, and will have a website up soon.

It would be fantastic to connect with people about urban planning, design, and development, as well as mapmaking, civic technology, public health, and gardening. I will soon be working as a project manager for an art and design consultancy that works with international artists, so if you would also like to talk about art making or collaborating on projects, that would be exciting!

Some artists I appreciate are Hundertwasser, Dallas Clayton, Henriette Picker, and Jihan Zencirli (Geronimo Balloons).

      I lived in Africa for 6yrs. In 2010, I volunteered in a village in Namibia,  teaching english and arts to 4-12 year olds.  Kids aged 5&10  weren’t much different in their capacities. They had poor living conditions and few quality social interactions. Many of them were raised by  chronically alcoholic parents. They slept on bare sand or a blanket that doubled as a mattress. Many were orphans, their parents died of HIV. Some families were better, most of my students were raised like this though. After few months of working with a group of 12 children, their minds opened up like popcorn and a child who wasn’t able to draw something recognizable before, was expressing himself in understandable english and built a house out of rough pieces of wood, with an original design, with windows, a door, and where you could enter and fit in; All out of play, and special attention to each child’s particular talents and weaknesses.

The inmates received  me with warmth and generosity. Discussing with several people I realized that if they had access to quality education they wouldn’t be there.

Cold mornings. Damp, slatted pine tables full of boxes of what my father called ‘smalls’. A few dollars in my pocket. Hot dogs for lunch. These were the Saturdays of my youth. Cherishing the idea of not knowing what I would find.

Along the way, I was drawn to tattered boxes of black and white photos and film canisters loaded with 8mm. Here were forgotten lives. Here were moments in time. Here was human history, relegated to the back table next to a pile of Mad Magazines and hand-forged iron tools.

I've heard it suggested that we die two deaths: The first is when you take your last breath. The second is when someone speaks your name for the last time. As I flip over a photograph and say, to myself, “Billy and George at the swimming hole - 1937”, have I resurrected them, or is someone out there still speaking their names?

Is it possible that there is no value in peering into the past at strangers? Are our lives separated by something as abyssmal as time, or something as ephemeral as a browning sheet of glossy photo paper?

Hundreds of years from now, what will become of audio recordings of my father playing whimsical, freestyle versions of Beatles songs on the piano? What about videos of my mother touring me around her home town? What about photos of my sisters and I wearing bee hats and pretending to play baseball?

In the spirit of keeping stories alive, I haven’t forgotten that I promised you Brando.

My Great Aunt Anne was a ghost.

I recall as a child climbing the faded, concrete steps into my great grandparents’ house to find her smoking cigarettes at the kitchen table. She was grey, hollow, alone.

Her family had committed her in the 50's. With years of electroshock therapy and experimental drug regimens, life was drained from her slowly. She whispered, she mumbled, she told stories that made no sense. She said that she had once worked with Marlon Brando.

When she died, I found her books, her poetry, her journals. From a family of blue collar workers, she had somehow become a poet, a dancer, an actress. A beatnik. An artist. I looked through her old playbills.

In the summer of 1953, George Bernard Shaw's play, “Arms and the Man” took the stage at the Theatre by the Sea playhouse in Rhode Island. Flipping through the playbill, I found my Aunt's name: Anne D., Stage Manager.

Flipping further I noted one of the stars of the show: Sergius Saranoff, Marlon Brando.

It had been the last stage play of his career.

Maybe they shared a conversation, a laugh, a glance. I'll never know. I never got the chance to ask her. But she remembered.

Maybe I can save this story. Maybe I can save others. Maybe I can leave something behind that doesn't wind up on a flea market table. Maybe if we try hard enough, people’s lives don’t need to blink out of existence.

If any of you want to preserve stories, let me know. I have a web domain that I would love to someday turn into a resting place for these memories I've collected.

If any of you spent time in Stamford, Connecticut or Mt. Kisco, New York before the 1970's, let me know. You may have known someone in my family!

Shout out to my friend Dan for introducing me to the List Serve.

Peace be with you.

August 2016,25,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/08/25/some-truths-about-iran/,"August 2016, 25",Some truths about Iran,"Hi all,

as a native German being married to an Iranian wife (that only came to Europe in her late twenties) and having travelled to Iran,I can say that I have a quite different picture from the country than most people have when reading the media. So I come upwith a very random list of prejudices and what I found to be real.

1.) Iran is very strictly IslamicI cannot speak for the poorer rural areas. But having a look at several Persian cities, I know that there are probably less strict muslims in private than there are strict Christians in the USA. The government is Islamic, sure. But regular people have a very relaxed view of the topic. I know many who are even aggressive atheists.

2.) Muslims don't drink alcoholMaybe that is true for strict muslims. But for regular Iranians, the opposite is true. I almost never drink alcohol myself (less than my wife), but in Iran, they drink alcohol everywhere, so I drink daily. Alcohol is very expensive, but virtually everyone has his dealer.

3.) Women are weak in IranWomen are getting stronger and they fight for their rights. They study all kinds of professions, especially professions that are typical ""men"" jobs in the western world. 50% of computer science or engineering students are female, a number unseen in the western world. While rare here, it is common for me to talk to Iranian women about stuff like agile software development, the latest database frameworks or the safety of car factories. My wife, as an example, is an industrial engineer.In Iran, women still have to wear a headscarf, but only few wear the iconic black chador. Many are dressed very fashionable, while still obeying to the government rules. Women are also allowed to run businesses or drive cars and travel alone. Iran is not to be compared to Saudi Arabia.

4.) Iran only has oil.While the build quality is not like in the west or far east, they produce millions of cars every year (sometimes they just assemble the parts from western, especially French, models). They are sold throughout the middle east. I've never sat in a car not produced there when I travelled to Iran.

5.) Iranians don't laughThe clerical government seems not to be funny, but that is not the reality of ordinary people. Iranians are very funny people, they tell a lot of jokes, like funny things, talk a lot. There exists a number of good native Iranian TV/DVD shows that make you laugh even when you don't speak a word of Persian. And they dance a lot! While dancing publicly is forbidden in Iran, everyone I know does it in private with guests.

6.) Entering the country is dangerousI found that at the passport control in the airport, the guards are usually very welcoming and very friendly. This is in stark contrast to how it is depicted in films. They usually want you to ""come back soon"" when you leave the country. The usual tourist will have a wonderful time in the country and probably make friends with a lot of very open people.

7.) Persian is difficult to learnIt is easier to learn than English because of its beautifully simple grammar that knows no exception from rules. No articles, no masculine/feminine forms (which makes it the perfect feminist language in theory). Learning to write Persian-Arabic script only takes you a day or two.

Go visit Iran while the Grand Bazaar of Teheran is still free from tourists!

August 2016,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/08/24/hands-pointed-up/,"August 2016, 24",Hands Pointed UP,"UP is a little two-letter word with so much meaning that it takes up a fourth of a page in the dictionary. My favorite words to use have become Hands Pointed UP, so I wrote a book about the subject of UP.  Every time I hear or picture these words, I get psyched UP and jazzed UP.

My book contains 90 inspirational sayings that include the word UP. It includes biblical references and other observations that will help you keep a positive attitude when you approach your most prized possession--the next 24 hours. I have collected these quotes over my lifetime, starting in a shoebox and working up to a computer. Everyone goes from hearing Jack and Jill went UP the hill, to kiss and make UP to “What’s UP?”

Everybody is thinking about life and its UPS and downs, they are UP in the air or down for the count; UP to something or down on somebody, UP a creek without a paddle or down in the dumps, we want to be UP to the minute, but we’re down to the wire. Since people know my favorite word is UP, everyone wants to meet UP with me, catch UP with me, raise their glass UP to me.

The reason I like UP comes from when I questioned my mother about what time she got married. She said noon “because the hands are pointed UP.” Towards heaven.

Many people have horseshoes that point UP, argue over cutlery in the dishwasher being UP so it gets cleaner, save pennies with heads UP or collect elephant trunks curling UP.

Shania Twain had a hit song UP that my niece won a talent show with.

I started thinking about good things that happen at noon and whether bad things happen at 6:30 when the hands are pointed down. One of the good things is  Presidential inaugurations. I wondered if criminals were born at 6:30.

Of course I served my guests at the book signing my new favorite drink, 7-UP. What about Stick UPS air fresheners, Block UP sunscreen, Kilz UP Shot Overhead Stain Sealer, the quilted picker-UPper, Easy UPS and Chicken Shake-UPS by Oscar Mayer?

To get you to buy clocks, ads feature 10:10 because it subliminally creates a smiley face with the hands UP.

Maybe you’ll start noticing these things, too. A friend called to tell me about the priest’s sermon on UP on Ascension Sunday. Since Christ was lifted UP into Heaven, the priest made ”UP” his key word, beginning with ""we wake UP"" and ""get UP,"" and ending about 10 minutes later saying something like ""and that sums my homily UP.""

Things in nature seem to point UP to God. Grass blades point UP as do mountain peaks. Tulip bulbs planted UPside down in the ground, manage to turn  UPward, breaking the soil to point toward the sky. What I can’t imagine is that sloths spend most of their time UPside down. They eat, sleep, mate and give birth that way.

Skiiers are told not to look down, as are beginning typists. A beginner will be frightened by the slope and overwhelmed by the distance. Looking down causes panic, instructors say. Same advice for models.

To end UP, people always tell each other not to give UP. Observers of the Korean prison camps gave the name Give-UP-itis to those who lapsed into a state of passive acceptance, the least likely to survive and recover. Stay suited UP. And stand UP for something.

August 2016,23,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/08/23/relatively-few-things-considered/,"August 2016, 23",Relatively Few Things Considered,"I'm lucky, I guess? 

I tried to die when I was born, and then I tried again a few years later when I got an unusually nasty flu. A dozen years after that someone dropped a rock off a bridge, magically hitting me in the head as I was trying to cross the river below, but I neither drowned nor died of a skull fracture. Subsequently, I've barely avoided being struck by lightning (20 feet), been stabbed (that really sucked), hit by a car (just a big bruise), gotten an arterial gas embolism (what?), had some bad luck with chemicals, narrowly avoided air accidents, grabbed a retaining bar in darkness at just exactly the right time to avoid a significant fall, been poisoned (why?), and been shot at a few times (they've missed every time so far, although once they used a rocket, which was really really surprising).

Every event thus far, the first thought in my head was some variant of ""whaaaat?"" followed closely by ""aw, shit"" (or an age-appropriate equivalent. I didn't swear as a kid). Depending on the event, later thoughts tend to be focused on why I can't hear, why I can't see, or why I can't feel important parts of me. Nothing profound. No life flashing before the eyes.

I have learned relatively little from any of this, except that dying sucks and almost dying also sucks to a lesser degree. I've seen people die, violently and otherwise, and between my repeatedly dodging fate and their failure to do likewise there's relatively little difference.

...and so now I find myself sitting quietly in a darkened house, listening to crickets, wondering when I'll next dodge fate. Or if I'll dodge fate next time. I'm thinking it'll probably be a car that gets me, or possibly something heart-related? As far as I know, nobody has any particular negative interest in me these days. In any event, I hope I won't outlive the few remaining people I care about.

Once upon a time, my personal slogan was: ""the suffering of others builds my character"". Can't remember where I heard that line. TV probably.

You can tell I wasn't the most considerate fellow. Nor the most cautious. I'd like to think I wasn't intentionally hurtful to anyone I didn't think deserved it, but if I could travel back in time I'd beat the shit out of myself, and if any of you can travel back in time I'd encourage you to do likewise.

These days, I think my slogan is more along the lines of: ""well, shit, I guess this has probably gone about as well as we could reasonably expect?""

Which is probably a lie.

August 2016,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/08/22/hello-911-what-is-your-emergency/,"August 2016, 22","Hello, 911, what is your emergency?","Las Vegas, the most famous city in the 47,877 square mile Mojave Desert, is 88 miles south west of Amargosa Valley, the city in which I work as an emergency dispatcher. Not much happens in ""The Jewel of Nye County,"" but sometimes, between getting crank calls, complaints from visitors to the Alien Cathouse (the local brothel), and cheaters caught at the only casino before tourists get to Vegas, something memorable happens.

When the phone rang at 11:52pm on January 14th, 2012, I kicked into gear and jammed the 'Line 1' button on my desk phone as I flipped my headset's microphone down in front of my mouth. I waited for the line to connect before I fired off my identification and shot a concerned and – since I'd been practicing the same 3 words for almost 8 years – rehearsed ""What's your emergency?""

I didn't get an immediate response, so I repeated my question to the caller. A moment passed and then the man on the other end sprung into an excited jumble of words that spilled out of my earpiece.

""Oh thank God! I haven’t had signal for hours!"" And then, slightly muffled as if he withdrew the phone from his head, “Al, I got through to someone!” Pulling the phone back to his head, his voice boomed “we were riding our ATVs and ran outta gas and now we’re stuck in the desert!”

To say that statement was troubling is a massive understatement. The Mojave Desert is not a forgiving place after the sun goes down. Once the temperature drops to near freezing and you attempt to seek shelter, you have to worry about the coyotes and other predators coming out to hunt.

“Sir, I’m going to need to ask you a few questions so I can get emergency personnel on their way to you, ok? How many people are in your party?”

“2. Just me and my buddy Al” he replied.

“What city did you start in?”

“Sugar Bunker.”

“Do you know which direction you were driving before you ran out of gas?”

“I dunno. We were going west or maybe north, I think.”

His lack of confidence was unsettling, but since he was in range of our cell towers, I knew he couldn’t be more than 20 miles north of where I was sitting at my desk.

“Sir, can you describe your surroundings?” I wasn’t expecting much, because out in the desert everything is covered in sand and all the rocks look the same.

“I dunno. I mean, it’s a frickin’ desert, man. There are mountains behind us and I think we’re walking south.”

As I’d guessed, his response wasn’t very helpful but confirmed his general location, so I prompted him to be a bit more descriptive.

“Do you see any landmarks that can help me pin down your location? Are you near anything large or see anything that can help lead us to you?”

I waited as he audibly pondered my questions, hemming and hawing as he likely twirled around in the darkness, searching for something – anything – to give me as a bearing on which I could send the cavalry. I was ready to punch the autodialer for our search & rescue squad (which wasn’t much of a “squad” as it was 3 guys that also volunteered at the fire house) and feed them any scraps of information my lost caller could give me. He cleared his throat and what he said next was unmistakable.

“Uh, anything large?” He mused, almost rhetorically. “Hell yeah! We are directly under the moon.”

I love motorcycling.  This year, I got a brand new awesome bike.  I love the sense of freedom and the art of riding skillfully.

Earlier this summer, in upstate New York on a country road, I was in a motorcycle accident.  It was a beautiful night, I was driving carefully like always, and the next thing  I knew I was slammed down on the road sliding to a stop with my bike next to me.

I was so lucky.  Cars were around me and no one  hit me.  I was able to get up and get off the road.  Someone helped me pick my brand new bike up.So what happened?  A child and her Dad were playing basketball in the driveway.  The ball rolled out into my path and jammed underneath, instantly tipping me sideways.  I called my wife and she came to get me.  The man offered to keep my bike in his garage.

I realized I was going into shock.  I also suspected that I had at least broken some ribs, since it was painful to breath. My arm and hand was swelling up and bleeding.  I asked my wife to drive me to the hospital. Once at the hospital, they triaged me in fairly quickly and I had a series of diagnostic x-rays, CT scans, and blood work.  They diagnosed one broken rib, but my blood work was showing some troubling signs of pancreas damage.  They urged me to be admitted.

Two days later, my blood markers looked better and they released me.  I happily came home and began a slow recovery.  My arm was completely purple.  My rib hurt so much I could not get out of bed without horrific pain.

Now it is 2 months later and I'm mostly recovered.  My bike is fixed and I'm riding it again, albeit with some trepidation.

Here's the thing:  Accidents happen sometimes out of nowhere no matter how careful you are and how much you try to mitigate the risk.  What saved me was having good protective gear, including a helmet, jacket and gloves.  I can't imagine how much worse this would have been to have my skip scraped off without this equipment. This summer there have been some hot days when I almost didn't wear protective clothing.  I'm very glad I did anyway.

in 2015 i chose the word happy: to pursue things that make me happy, thus the hard conversations that led to the end of my marriage. i started hosting a standup comedy showcase featuring the funniest ladies in NC. i was cast in a local independent movie WITH all of my clothes on! i left a lousy job where i was overworked and underpaid.

when 2016 started, i was optimistic. 2015 was the bad chapter, 2016 was a new book altogether. in 2016 i chose the word light and held on to happy. i had some plans for weight loss (being light-er), dealing with some of my darkest shames, focusing on activities and friendships that bring positivity, etc.

but the job i took to escape that lousy job turned out to be toxic quicksand. my apartment was lonely. i hadn’t negotiated fair pay when i was hired and my savings had been sitting at $30 for months. when i was alone after work the thought processes that creeped in were scathingly unkind. i began to spiral. alcohol definitely helped take the edge off of those self-aimed sharp “you’re failing” thoughts. i wasn’t taking care of myself, so i did what everybody does who is lonely and hating themself: downloaded Tinder.

dating apps are FABULOUS for instant validation of being a desirable woman. but i’m not good at not getting attached to handsome men who want to hang out with me. i was stood up by 2 different Joshes in 2 weeks. then i met Drew.

Drew showed up at our first date with cookies he’d baked at home for himself for fun. Drew does improv and it was the definition of hitting it off. we were all in. we deleted all of the dating apps; immediately settling into a routine of basically living together. my apartment was never empty when i got home, and there was a man who wanted to talk to me!

Drew had been looking for work. he’d had a phone interview for a job in Dallas. i told him that he was free to do whatever he needed to and that we’d figure it out. of course i didn’t want him to go, but he got the job and we started planning a long distance relationship. i helped him pack his apartment into a crate, and then we drove to TX in 4 days. it was the best road trip of my life.

i got a new job in Durham, and we both started on June 13th. we talked every night. it felt like he was still in town, just unable to come over.

until July. he went silent. his phone wasn’t working. he took days to text me back. made me worry. on August 10th he called me to break up, the next day he admitted to meeting someone else. he canceled my plane ticket for 8/18 to celebrate our August birthdays.

i am figuring out what to do with the remaining 139 days of 2016 without rose colored glasses.

i have light to chase and so many jokes to write. all that worry in July helped me cut alcohol out and go running. i am freer than before.

please send me a birthday message world (8/21),

love,

So, what to write?

How about some honesty... something I have been keeping from myself for quite some time.

--

At the age of 24, I was handed my dream job. Barely out of college, and based purely on my performance working with local groups, I was selected and hired as Director of Bands for a gorgeous university. For as long as I could remember, this is where I always wanted to end up -- working with bright, motivated students to create entertaining field productions, perform expressive concerts, and spread the message that life is all about finding what you are PASSIONATE about and embracing it fully and without repose.

Life was suddenly perfect. I immediately knew that every day moving forward, I would awaken, put on a spirited polo shirt or suit and tie, walk to campus, and spend 8-10-12 hours SURROUNDED by everything I loved most in life. It was going to be.... perfect.

And so it was.

But I didn't appreciate it.

I let things get in the way.

~""Our budget has been stagnant for a decade! This is a reflection of their lack of respect for me!""~~""A student doesn't like the show design! They obviously hate me!""~~""These alumni don't like the Homecoming plans! They must not care about the Band!""~

I focused exclusively on everything that WASN'T working, and allowed myself to forget exactly how perfect everything actually was...

All the ensembles were growing!MULTIPLE-times more performances than this school used to do!NEW ensembles started!

Heck, we CREATED and HOSTED one of the largest band festivals in US history!

But it didn't matter. Ego. Ego got the best of me. And it all came to a head at a homecoming game. As we took the field at halftime, the Athletic Director wanted to change the timeframe, and expected us to change our show...

~""He doesn't care how much work they've put in! He doesn't care about us!""~

So I refused. I had the Band continue on, as rehearsed. And halftime went off without a hitch.

And I lost my job.

Here I am, 2-years later, in my 30's, working in the field of mental health. Every day, I go to work and ask one question of myself:

~""What is best for the person in front of me?""~

Some days, patients smile while I listen to why they're happy with their new meds.Some days, patients cry while I listen to why they're hurting.Some days, patients yell while I listen to why they think I'm worthless.Some days, patients thank me for staying with them despite everything they've said.

Gone are the days of thinking of my ego. I keep it in a box, in a storage locker, alongside most of the belongings of my 'old life'. I visit the locker every few months to get a knickknack or trinket, usually something to pass along to a niece or nephew. Every time I open that door, I am reminded of what I used to be, and what I try every day to never return to. 

""It is never too late to be what you might have become.""

I became overly excited, dreaming about the amazing prize that required nothing short of physically being placed into my awaiting hands. The had tried to deliver it, and the notice explained that they'll attempt 3 times and then it will be returned to sender. Attempt 2 was too late to stop. I logged onto the website provided to reschedule it, since due to working a traditional 8-5 schedule, I could not be home between 10-4 on a weekday.

That's when I learned they had me right where they wanted me. 

Want to reschedule delivery? That'll be $5.Want a weekend delivery? Tough crap. Not an option.Want a new address (aka: work)? $5 please.Want to pick it up yourself at a local UPS store? Sure, for $5.

Me, screaming at the computer: ""What are my free options for this thing that I have no idea what it is???""

1. Return to sender (Seriously. That's an option they list on their website.

2. Drive to the middle of nowhere and pick it up myself at a free warehouse. 

Guess what I got to do later that week?

It better be a damned pony.

(Approximately 3 days later, I went to claim my mystery package. It was not a pony. It was a box of cereal. My brain exploded.)

Since 2005 I have been active on this website that was just gaining wider traction: Wikipedia. This website was working from a crazy concept: asking people to contribute knowledge, to co-author an encyclopedia without any compensation whatsoever. And somehow, it worked out just fine.

The success of Wikipedia is visible in the way students do their homework, journalists get background information, or in how students understand the context of their materials better. Wikipedia is used to settle bets and disputes, and to satisfy curiosity. Who hasn't started reading a Wikipedia article, and found themself later on a totally unrelated topic after clicking through a variety of links. 

What not everybody realises, is that Wikipedia is not created out of thin air. Wikipedia is written by some 80.000 volunteers around the world, and depends on three main factors that are all crucial to its continued existance. And your help is needed, to keep Wikipedia as good as it is, to improve it even further. 

1) Roughly once a year, depending on where you live, you're most likely asked for a financial contribution. These contributions make it possible that there is a (technical) infrastructure, that there is a level of community building and that the software is improved.

2) Wikipedia is a so-called 'teriary source', which means that it highly depends on the availability of information and knowledge in other sources: newspapers, research publications, books, photographs. It is crucial that there is an ecosystem of fact checkers, researchers and journalists that collect and write up information, which is accessible to Wikipedians around the world. You can help by making your publications openly accessible, by putting your pieces out there. You can help by supporting journalists, researchers and photographers working under such models - as professional or as volunteer. 

3) Finally, and maybe most importantly, you're invited to contribute your knowledge to articles, by clicking the 'edit' button that shines on top of every article. If you see a spelling mistake, please fix it. If you find information elsewhere that isn't on Wikipedia yet, add it. If you see an error, help the person after you looking it up, and improve it. 

Together we can upkeep the quality of Wikipedia, improve its quality, and work towards its ultimate vision: to make the sum of all knowledge available to every single human being. 

Thank you.

But today, I received the proverbial email while driving with my family three hours (thank you, small-town MO) to the St. Louis airport, where I boarded the plane I’m now sitting in. I drank in my last glimpses of the city that has been my home for the past 6 years, and the state that I have lived in my whole life, but won’t see again for a year.

With that kind of timing, it seems the world has already decided my topic for me.

For the past two years I’ve worked at a St. Louis rape crisis center, working with survivors of sexual assault and sex trafficking. It‘s been an incredible opportunity; I grew as an advocate, employee, coworker, friend, social justice warrior, and human. One listserve topic I’d considered was the impact trauma can have over a lifetime. Fortunate that I’ve never dealt with suicidal thoughts myself, it wasn’t until this job that I came to truly understand why someone would view suicide as her only way to end the unbearable pain.

I’m so grateful for that job, but I was burning out fast, from constantly witnessing the ugliness of the world (reactively, never in a position to stop it. Just try to make it hurt less), and from draining office dynamics. If anyone knows how to solve issues of high turnover rates in nonprofits due to burnout, please let me know (seriously, if I could become aneffective, helpful consultant, I might just dedicate my life to that).

Then I visited Australia and New Zealand last summer with two friends from a semester in Holland, and I fell in love with Sydney in a way I never have before with a city. I met ex-pats living there on year-long visas, and realized maybe I could do it too, as a gap year before grad school.

So I started talking about it, more and more confidently, until one day I bought a one-way ticket to Sydney. I put in four weeks’ notice, did what else I could for my incredibly strong clients, and spent time soaking up St. Louis. I set up trips to see friends and family, and say year-long goodbyes, which is why I’m heading to Denver, LA, and SF. (I’ll be going to Burning Man for the first time – any tips??).

Goodbyes have been rough. The weight of my decision is sinking in as I realize how many special relationships I’m leaving behind. But I’ve also realized that in order to grow, thrive, and learn I need to intentionally place myself in conducive environments. I’m fortunate to be at a place in my life where I can easily change my reality. And right now I need to take time to invest in myself so I can come back refreshed, with a better sense of how to lovingly, sustainably invest in others again.

That’s my story. I’m happy to share my blog. If you have any Sydney connections who have room in their life for a new American friend, or just a tour or some tips, I’d be grateful. I’ll be building a community from scratch, so I’m on the lookout for wonderful humans.

Lastly, a few brief poems, format inspired by the soul-opening nayyirah waheed.

August 2016,12,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/08/12/mr-tomato-and-nugget-the-chicken/,"August 2016, 12",Mr. Tomato and Nugget the Chicken,"Food is a right, not a privilege.  But some do have privileges that allow them to exercise that right more freely than others.  I have been extremely privileged in that regard throughout my life.  I grew up on a farm, where we always had our own garden and livestock.  I also lived in an area where other foods we wanted/needed were low cost.  When I started law school and moved to a food desert in Baltimore I lost a (small) portion of that privilege.  Because I grew up on a farm, I feel like my life has centered around food production, first inadvertently and now intentionally.  After law school, I intend to pursue food law, approaching it from a public health perspective to combat food deserts and increase access to healthy foods for people in urban and rural environments.My inspiration/motivation, and the explainer of the subject line, comes from my experience working with an organization called Amir (google Amir Project if you’re interested).  My explanation of the organization is that Amir uses informal garden education at summer camps to teach kids about social justice.  Amir hires college students and trains them to become Farmers at camps.  Of course, working with the organization over two summers revealed that it was more than that.  I saw the organization lay the groundwork to expand past summer camps, to year-round gardens.  The work was fulfilling because I didn’t just see the campers we worked with grow and learn, but the Farmers as well.  I happened to be working at a camp with a high tuition rate (about $5,000/month), with campers whose parents could afford to shop at Whole Foods.  But that didn’t halt their sense of wonder when they saw a tomato plant in the garden for the first time or picked their own chocolate mint and muddled it.During one of our discussions, we used weeds as a metaphor for problems we encounter in real life, and discussed how they could be weeded out.  This was followed by a removal of weeds from our lettuce bed.  One of the young campers, 7 years old at the time, found a tomato plant in the lettuce bed.  The other Farmer and I explained that yes, that tomato plant was a weed in the lettuce bed, because we hadn’t planted it there on purpose.  The young camper wanted to keep it, though, so we helped her transplant it to a wooden raised bed.  She named it Mr. Tomato.  When I came back for my second summer at camp, Mr. Tomato wasn’t there, but he had left seeds that grew into volunteers, so his family was there to greet that camper.Another program component was our animals.  The first summer, we had ten chickens.  Like some of the plants, campers had not interacted with chickens that were still clucking.  One of the older campers coined the name Nugget for one of the hens, and made sure to walk by every day and say “Hi” to her.My experience with this program was transformative.  However, I think many of the lessons can be replicated anywhere you can grow food and share it with people.  We all eat, so why don’t we have more of a connection with our food?  There will be ethical considerations, about the use of pesticides, GMOs, or the labor that goes into food production.  But we can cut many of those out if we follow our food from seed to table.  And if that doesn’t interest you, playing in the dirt is just as fun now as when you were a kid!

By embracing my messiness I have opened myself up to so much more. It isn’t easy. It requires being uncomfortable, confessing that I am not perfect, and making mistakes, lots and lots of mistakes. It requires learning a whole new language of humility and diving into the deep dark inner regions of my soul to truly understand what is behind my hesitation or fear and owning it.  It is clearing the way to see clearly.

This work has allowed me to see the beauty and possibility in new adventures—starting my own business, venturing into the world of online dating and picking up moving across the country away from friends and family but towards the life I was meant to live.

Now as I build my consulting business, working with organizations (non profits/NGOs, government, for profit) to develop strategy, business plans, partnerships and generally have greater impact—I encourage them to embrace the messiness. Change evokes strong emotions, it reveals barriers and resistance and can literally derail an organization. Using similar techniques we create a new language of conflict and learn how to identify and address those barriers to move the organization forward.

I’m Julia. I’ve been on the Listserve for almost four years now, so it’s about damn time I won the thing.

A little about me: I’m 23. I live in NYC. I’m a reporter at BuzzFeed, and I mostly cover human interest news. I love dogs (obsessively), knitting (ineptly), reading (everything, especially weird non-fiction), and going to concerts (I’ve seen Third Eye Blind thrice and counting).

A few thoughts on stuff:

1.	The best part about my job is getting to interview everyday people who do wonderful/funny things (e.g. a woman who is cosplaying through cancer treatment, a 15-year-old girl who got her head stuck in a Barney mascot head, the dad behind the “Cheerio Challenge”, etc.). The worst part is how mean the internet can be, and also today a guy on a dating app said “lol you should write a listicle about me.” :/

2.	Every night/morning, I write in my “5 Minute Journal.” As someone who always wanted to keep a journal but never kept it up, this thing is great. Search Amazon, it’s worth trying.

3.	School always made me think I was a failure, which I think had less to do with my intelligence and more to do with how we treat learning disabilities (especially in girls). I was never formally diagnosed with a LD, but had at least one elementary school teacher who I later found out had told my parents I should get tested. I never was. I’m doing OK now, but school was hard for me in ways it maybe didn’t have to be.

4.	I got half a boob job in high school because I had severely asymmetrical boobs that really messed up my self image for most of my life. I wrote an essay about it on BuzzFeed a couple months ago, which was a HUGE deal for me after years of keeping it a shameful secret.

5. I’m on Team Mystic (level 18), and my starter Pokemon is always and forever Squirtle.

6.	My circle of friends from college lost a few people in the last 13 months. Untimely, sudden deaths of young people alter your world in a way that cannot be undone. A little over a year later, I don’t know if I’ve had any major EPIPHANIES, but the sheer knowledge of grief has made me (and all of us) kinder and a bit more forgiving. It still feels unfair. I think it always will.

7.	The world is bit of a dumpster fire lately, so everyone should register to vote!

8.	A few book suggestions: Smoke Gets In Your Eyes, The Language Of Food, and my all time fave, Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy. I read this book every time I need it. It’s like meditating to me, at this point.

9.	Music you should listen to: Chance’s newest mixtape. The newest Ariana Grande album (it is SO GOOD DO NOT START WITH ME). Smoke and Ashes by Tracy Chapman. Third Eye Blind’s cover of Mine. Jojo's (yes that Jojo) cover of Marvin’s Room. Coffee by Miguel. Borne On The FM Waves Of The Heart by Against Me. Depending on when this email comes out, Frank Ocean’s new album. Hopefully.

Say hi! Ask me questions! Give me compliments! Send me pics of your dog!

August 2016,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/08/08/the-untold-story-of-indians-in-america/,"August 2016, 08",The Untold Story of Indians in America,"As a first-generation Indian American, I grew up with stories of my parents immigrating to America in the 1970s with little to their name but a good work ethic and some education. Their story became one of quiet determination to build a solid foundation for me, my brother and my extended family. I recently read an article from 1909 about earlier Indian immigrants called “The Hindu Invasion: A New Immigrant Problem.” This story opened my eyes to a broader history, and the struggles faced by this first wave of Indian Americans paints a picture that we can learn a lot from today.

Let’s rewind to the turn of the 19th century. The wounds of the Civil War were fresh. In half a century, the technological breakthroughs of the Industrial Revolution had transformed the United States from an agrarian economy to an increasingly urban manufacturing powerhouse that was also increasingly diverse: between 1860 and 1900, 14 million immigrants came to American shores seeking the American Dream.

By the 1890s, a trickle of Punjabis landed on the west coast of the US looking for work. Almost immediately locals took note, asking in the 1909 article, “Who are these tawny-skinned, black bearded, turbaned Asiatics? Do we want them? Are they desirable immigrants? Shall we welcome them or oppose their coming?”

To answer the question, a now-familiar refrain arose pitting labor versus capital.

The White working class was nervous, noting that “the coming of hordes of Asiatic laborers will keep wages down and crowd the white man to the wall, since a white man can not or will not come down to the Asiatic laborer’s low standard of living.”

Capitalists, however, needed every worker they could get. “Railroads are to be constructed, cities built... and scores of other industries await but the touch of labor to transform our country into a land of unexampled prosperity. We are eagerly seeking labor. If a white man wants work, why don’t he come forward?”

While our economy convulsed towards a new equilibrium, the United States Congress began considering a set of nativist immigration laws. In 1917, despite a veto from President Woodrow Wilson, Congress passed legislation that barred a laundry list of individuals including “homosexuals,” and “feeble-minded persons,” from becoming naturalized citizens. It also banned Asian immigration entirely. US Citizenship was hereby limited to “free white men.”

This narrative could continue to explore the story of Bhagat Singh Thind, whose pursuit of citizenship led to a failed 1923 Supreme Court challenge that ultimately restricted Indian immigration for decades (see Unites States v Bhagat Singh Thind). It could continue through the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s, which paved the way for many of our families to settle. It could include contemporary stories of a growing diaspora. But let’s pause for a second.

We’re in the midst of an election where we’re hearing a major party candidate use language straight from “The Hindu Invasion” to pit American workers against a different immigrant group. In 1917, our Congress determined Asians were unfit to immigrate to the US and banned the entire continent. Today, this same candidate for President is advocating for the exclusion of entire religions and regions from immigration to the US. We have an opportunity to learn from the struggles of those who came before us so that we don’t cause the same suffering endured during the last century. If you live in the US, please vote, and not just this year.

There are many more stories to be told about Indian American immigration, and immigrants in general. I’d love to hear yours!

August 2016,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/08/06/change-ringing/,"August 2016, 06",Change Ringing,"Well, what do you know? I've won the Listserve. Having been a subscriber since May, 2012, and assuming about 23000 members, I calculate that I had about a 6.5% chance of winning after that amount of time. So I count myself lucky!

I consider myself a minor math geek. One of the ways I express that is with participating in an old English pastime called Change Ringing. If you have spent time in England, or the East Coast of the United States, you may have heard church bells ringing. Normally there are 8 bells, sometimes more, rarely fewer. They will ring in “rounds”, from highest note (smallest bell) to the lowest.  They may then start permuting their order, following a simple rule:

	1)	From one change to the next, a bell may move its ringing position one place forward, or one place back, or stay in the same position.

That means that, if I am ringing the bell in the 4 position in one change, then for the next change I can either ring in the 3 position, or stay in the 4 position, or move to the 5 position. Of course, I must also coordinate with all the other ringers, or else things just turn into a hash!

The way this is normally shown on paper is to put a bell number (say, 1 through 8) into a position number (the same count as the number of bells). We always start in “rounds”, which is

	12345678

Bell 1 is in position 1, bell 2 is in position 2, etc. Bell 8 is in position 8. If we now just switch each pair of bells, we will ring

	21436587

Bell 1 is now in position 2, bell 2 is in position 1, and bell 8 is in position 7. And no bell is more than 1 position away from its prior position, satisfying the rule. If we again just switch each pair of bells, we return to rounds, and that’s not very interesting. But if we do something slightly different, and leave the bells in positions 1 and 8 alone (these are bells 2 and 7 currently), and switch every other pair, starting at position 2, we get something new:

	24163867

Bell 2 is still in position 1, bell 4 is in position 2, etc. Again, no bell is more than 1 position away from its prior position.

The goal is to ring a number of changes, starting in rounds and ending in rounds, and never repeat a change. As you can imagine, this can take some thought the first time you start thinking about it.

The group I ring with is not in a church tower, because the closest tower with bells is about 1000 miles away! Instead, we use handbells, with a bell in each hand. So, since we are each controlling 2 bells, we only need 4 people to ring with 8 bells. And with 8 bells, you can ring for a very long time, if you choose the right set of changes.

One of the best parts about change ringing, versus other bell choirs, is that we can ring with any number of people. We don’t worry about someone missing rehearsal. We can still ring, albeit with fewer bells to ring.

If you are in the San Diego area and would be interested in exploring change ringing, or if you have experience with change ringing, please search for Encinitas Handbell Change Ringers where you will find our blog, which includes contact information. Or just reply to this email. I would be happy to chat!

My 13 year old daughter had been having some knee pain but we thought it was growing pains.  Then it didn’t go away.  The doctor wanted an X-Ray.  Something looked “off”.  Let’s get an MRI.  Something is definitely off.  Let’s do a biopsy.

Within the span of a week our lives took a 180 degree turn.  We were gearing up for a fun summer.  We had started the process of looking at houses and, in fact, had an offer in on a house we loved (that fell through).  It was an exciting time.

Then you find out your kid has cancer.  Osteosarcoma.  It’s a somewhat rare but fairly treatable bone cancer.

As I’m writing this we’ve been through 2 rounds of chemo (that’s six total hospital visits) and we are 2 days away from a six-hour surgery where they will be replacing a lot of the bone around her knee with metal and plastic.  All of our treatments and surgery are happening nearly three hours away from home at Vanderbilt in Nashville.

She’s long since lost her hair.  We are dealing with a plethora of meds, the side effects, and chemo sickness.  One of the cancer meds can cause heart problems which will necessitate a heart scan every year for the rest of her life.  Another can cause hearing loss, and it has already caused a perceptible amount.  The knee replacement will eventually wear out and sometime in the next 20 years she’ll need it again…and again…

And we are a long way from finished.  After surgery there’s a cast, PT and then twice as much chemo as before surgery.  And it all started with that one horrific fact: “Your kid has cancer.”  I thought often about what I’d write if I won the ListServe.  I didn’t know.  But I never dreamed this.

I’m working my way through dealing with this as a father, a husband, a Christian, a human.  I’m trying to figure out how to best take care of my daughter, our other daughter, my wife…myself.  We’ve had great support in family and friends.

As a Christian I am trying to find God's guidance in all of this.  Sometimes I feel deep comfort with a peace that really does pass all understanding.  Sometimes I'm yelling at Him.  Somehow I think he's really OK with both.  I do believe that this too shall pass.  We will be changed but I believe we can find goodness in this somewhere, somehow.  I do know it has made us cherish the good days, the days when we are all together, much more.

I was raised in a Catholic family. While not the most pious bunch, I can safely say that most or all of my extended family believe in some form of Heaven. ""She's in a better place,"" they said of my great aunt, Frida. ""He's watching over you now,"" they said of my grandfather, Richard. ""I know I'll see her again someday,"" my mother said of her mother, Mary, one of the most beautiful people I have ever known, or expect to know, as long as I live.

But when I, the only atheist in the whole church, broke down sobbing at my grandmother's funeral, I was not the only one. As I looked around me, I did not see people grieving for a loved one who had taken a long trip. When my relatives say these comforting things, all I can hear are the words they cannot bring themselves to say: ""They are gone, and they are never coming back.""

I do not believe in any kind of afterlife; when the respiratory system halts its vital operation, and brain tissue starts to degenerate due to loss of oxygen, that person has ceased to exist. They are gone, forever.

That's the sort of thought that drives people away from skepticism and into the arms of religion and mysticism. The sort of thought that terrifies me to my core.

How do I deal with that?

Cryonics.

Cryonics is the practice of lowering the temperature of an organism such that all biological activity (including decay) is suspended.

There is a consensus among scientists that someday, a suspension of neural activity will not prove ultimately fatal, and technology will provide a method to revive a person from this state. Until then, cryonic suspension of a recently deceased human body will preserve it in stasis, as long as its temperature remains below a certain threshold.

Cryonics is actually a lot more affordable than you probably think it is. Cryopreservation can be as cheap as $28,000, and you don't have to pay this in cash - the usual way of paying for cryonics is to purchase a life insurance policy that pays out to your cryonics provider upon your death. A term life policy that pays out at least $28,000 (at my age, anyway) can be as cheap as a few bucks a month.

The two main cryonics companies (at least in the US) are Alcor and the Cryonics Institute. Alcor is considered the state-of-the-art, but they charge $70,000 for neuropreservation (just your brain) and $200,000 for full-body preservation. The CI charges $28,000-$35,000 as a base rate for full-body cryopreservation (they don't offer a neuro option). Their respective websites have lots of resources for you to peruse.

If you have more questions, the LessWrong forum and the cryonics subreddit will have people who have gone through the process of signing up.

If you still need to be persuaded, search for “You Only Live Twice”, a blog post by Eliezer Yudkowsky.

At any rate, I don't intend to let a little thing like temporary interruption of neural activity get in the way of my immortality, and neither should you.

Only I realized that my silence was part of the silence of the countryside. And I did not feel abandoned. The horse, from which I'd fallen, was waiting for me beside the river. I remounted and sped along the slopes where refreshing shadows were gathering. I pulled up the reins, stroked the animal's fevered and throbbing neck. I rode on at a slow pace, listening to the happiness inside me, as high and limpid as a summer sky. I stroked my arms where there were still trickles of water. I could feel the live animal close to me, an extension of my body. We both breathed, throbbing and youthful. A somewhat sombre colour had settled on the plains, warmed by the last rays of sunlight and the gentle breeze slowly died away. I must never forget, I thought, that I have been happy, that I am happy, happier than anyone could hope to be. But I forgot, I was always forgetting.

August 2016,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/08/01/embalmarama/,"August 2016, 01",Embalmarama,"I work in a funeral home, and I have some stories to share with you.

Once:

At a graveside service, a dove was released as a symbol of a free soul at peace. As the priest invited everyone to watch the bird circle in the sky, a hawk suddenly darted in and knocked the dove straight out of the air; the dead weight dropped into some nearby bushes. Everyone watched on as the bird of prey made a beeline to its lunch. The family wondered out loud if they still had to pay for the dove release.

Once:

            Staff were in the upstairs office while a visitation was going on downstairs, when a blood-curdling shriek filled the funeral home.  Rushing downstairs, we expected to find someone collapsed from a heart attack. Turns out the family hadn’t checked what exactly was already on the USB stick they had given us to load with pictures, to play on loop throughout the course of the visitation. Surprise: interspersed with heart-warming photos of the deceased and his family was also homemade amateur pornography starring the man now in the casket.

Did you know?:

Dead bodies poop. A lot. Hence, packing orifices with cotton to prevent leakage is crucial.

Crazy glue is like the duct tape of the embalming room. The uses are virtually endless.

Vaseline will bring blackened, dehydrated lips right back to their pre-dead plumpness in a matter of hours.

Respect to the body is key in every prep room I’ve worked in. Bodies must be covered with sheets to maintain dignity, embalming equipment and tools should never be placed on top of anyone, and though the atmosphere is casual – singing along to the radio while embalming is something I do often – jokes are never made at the expense of the deceased.

Making a body look “natural” and “resting” is ironically one of the most unnatural and arduous tasks. Hours go into injecting, massaging, suturing, aspirating, dressing, cosmetizing and casketing, to create that perfect “just sleeping” look. The amount of detail painstakingly taken to create a comforting and lasting memory is enormous, and though I have strong opinions on whether or not our approach to death is psychologically healthy, I have a deep respect for skilled embalmers and the work they do.

 Pro tips:

            Don’t send low-cut clothing for your loved one to be dressed in. It makes it harder to hide the incision used for embalming, which is usually along the collarbone.  Along the same lines: pulling jeans or tight clothing onto a clammy dead person is not easy. Think of your local mortician, stick with easy breezy blouse and slacks.

            Do understand that just because we’ve been given a picture, doesn’t mean we will necessarily be able to recreate the resting face of that person. They may not look like they’re sleeping, that’s because they aren’t.

            Don’t ask us to remove gold teeth.

            Do educate yourself about your rights as a consumer in the death industry. In most provinces, you are legally allowed to do everything yourself, from registering the death, to holding a visitation in your living room and building a casket. The more personal effort a family puts into being a part of their loved one’s sendoff, the healthier the grieving process tends to be.

Cheers to life and death,

The moon has just become some off center rock formation. Even Sgr A*, at the center of our galaxy, is young in an ever expanding infinity. Lost in an understanding of math. An understanding that      the limit as x-> infinity of 1/x=0 is an understanding of my own nothingness. Yet understanding that      the sum of 1/x, from x=1 to x=infinitydivergesis an understanding of more than that.

I remember what my grandfather told my dad, told me, his only daughter: Life is nothing      but a kite,          in a box,               in a house called eternity. 

I'm an astrophysics and computer science student. I study black holes and neutron stars right now, and sometimes I get lost in the scales of the universe. I find it interesting how I can easily talk about objects hundreds times larger than the sun, and then talk about the particle collisions that make them burst. The universe as we know it is infinite, and yet we are made of the same infinitesimal parts. Sometimes I get a bit lost in the math, sometimes I get a bit lost in the wonder.

I just wanted to thank my dad for everything. I can trace my dreams to his- he taught me how to use my first telescope and how to write. We used to trade stories and poems, and still do. He's coming out with his first book this year, called Dynasty of the Magi. I'm on my way to hopefully be an astronaut, but I have to survive (and afford) undergrad first.

The conference room is jam packed and there’s a buzz throughout the place. I take my seat along the side and wait for the ceremony to start. In the middle of the room sit 134 eager students, and behind them are hundreds of proud family members with their cameras poised, ready to snap a photo of their child walking across the stage.

It’s graduation day, and although it’s much like every graduation happening across the country, it feels even more special because all of the seniors are young people of color who grew up in low-income communities. The weight of the occasion comes not only because these students made it to high school graduation; it’s also because they finally have a day to celebrate, which is not easy to come by in the tough city of Newark. More often than not, they are mourning, angry, sad, or frustrated, but today is all about joy. The ceremony proceeds like graduations do, but with a few highlights:  the scholarship winners are announced, which causes an eruption of cheers from the crowd and a flow of tears from the students who are shocked to discover they’ve won thousands of dollars towards their college education; the keynote speaker brings her own DJ, and part of her speech is to play “All the Way Up” by Fat Joe and Remy Ma, during which the students pop out of their seats and dance; and a fellow 2016 classmate, who passed away from cancer, is honored, and her family is given a diploma in her name. All of this culminates with the students walking across the stage to receive their high school diploma, while their families run up to take the photo they’ve been waiting for, big smiles across everyone’s faces.

Once caps have been thrown in the air and degrees have officially been conferred, I make my way across the crowd to congratulate the seniors. While doing so, I can’t help but pause and revel in what’s going on. Everywhere I turn, the students from the Class of 2016 are embracing. And my favorite part about it is it’s mostly the boys. I see Malik, the scholar athlete, and Saheed, the class videographer, hugging and clapping each other’s backs. I see James, the class clown, doing the same with his best friend from 5th grade. It’s such an emotional scene that I’m frozen - all I can do is look around and smile for these amazing young people. To be in this room is to experience the purest and most acute sense of joy and possibility. I leave the graduation feeling uplifted and energetic, hoping that my students’ lives are filled with days like this one.

---------------

I’m an educator at KIPP NJ, and I, like everyone in the US, have been overwhelmed with the news of violence in this country and throughout the world. The feeling of hopelessness, anger and frustration is permeating, which only leads to more violence. I believe much of this stems from the stories and images we see, and the stories of black men and women are far too often negative and violent. This is not my experience at all - the students that I work with are hilarious, smart, generous, and strong. I wanted to share this story of them as a way to spread positivity - positivity within schools, within the black community, within the US; I hope you all find your own positive story despite this mess we’re in and share it with others.

July 2016,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/07/29/life-will-show-you/,"July 2016, 29",Life will show you,"In English, the saying goes, “time will tell.” In Russian, the saying goes, “жизнь покажет” or “life will show you.” I have this phrase tattooed on my ribs as a daily reminder of the people, places and things life has shown me, many of which I never expected. How this phrase got there is a story in and of itself and it all started when I got on a plane to Kiev, Ukraine in September of 2010.

I had joined the Peace Corps after graduating from Texas A&M earlier that year and was selected to serve as an elementary school teacher in a small town about 3 hours northeast of Kiev called Konotop. Arriving in Ukraine, I hardly knew anything about the people, their culture, let alone a word of Ukrainian or Russian. In fact, on my first night my host family had to open a dictionary and point to the word “macaroni” to ask if I would eat that for dinner, so I nodded my head yes and thankfully macaroni is what ended up on my plate. As my Russian improved, I began to immerse myself into a beautiful culture few westerners know much about. Life had shown me how to communicate.

After living with my host family for three months, I moved into a small apartment complex. I bought some cookies and introduced myself to my neighbors (how very American of me!). When an elderly couple, Anatoliy and Nina, opened their door, I introduced myself (in pretty broken Russian) and they invited me in for tea. Little did I know that I had met my new Babushka (grandma) and Dedushka (grandpa). Every day thereafter, I was expected to show up at their house to have dinner with them. Even though they receive very little in retirement (<$100/month) and live in a 500 sq. ft. apartment without hot water, they were willing to share their food with me and never asked for anything in return. Through their kindness and generosity, I became part of their family. They are always with me as my tattoo “жизнь покажет” is in their handwriting. Life has shown me that you can find family.

The struggles of daily life include -20 degree weather and schools that are closed for weeks at a time because they cannot afford to heat the classrooms, and now war. 10,000 people have already died due to the war in eastern Ukraine, yet it is something that rarely makes our news… why is that? (If you have a chance, watch Winter on Fire on Netflix to learn more about how the revolution started.) Life has shown me the many hardships these people overcome.

Ukrainians use their dinner tables to share unique life stories and songs passed down from generation to generation. The time spent with a group of family members and friends sitting around a table covered in fresh homegrown fruits and vegetables, steaming borsch soup, salads, breads, and pastries is one of the most important parts of their community. Their laughter and love is often seasoned by some stiff homemade vodka. Life has shown me how important community is.

Life has shown me a community that I love and I want life to show this community that people from around the world care about them too. I have started a project on CrowdRise (search Konotop within the site) to build a skate park for the kids of Konotop to use. Please donate if you can.

Say yes more. You can sleep when you’re dead.

I have never been good making long introductions so I will be straight to the point.

I am a PhD Student working on metal-air batteries: they store energy thanks to oxygen. Amazing no? But it’s what I want to tell you today.

For two years now, I dedicate a lot of my spare time to an association trying to connect better researchers, entrepreneurs and general public (just type BeyondLab in your favorite search engine).

I don’t know how it works in your country, but here, in France, academic research in mainly funded by the State. And so many results are just sleeping in the labs.

It’s a shame because these results are funded with public money, they are supposed to belong to everyone but society cannot enjoy it, for many reasons…

Whether you are a scientist or not, I will be really interested to read your opinion on this topic.

What is your opinion of research?

Do we need more or less? How do the topics studied should be chosen? Do you think research is useful for your everyday life?

I think that it’s really fundamental to maintain an open and multidisciplinary research to continue understanding and discovering great things.

Just check out the TED Talk by Steven Johnson “Where good ideas come from”: the story of GPS is a nice example of that philosophy.

To finish:

-I was last weekend to a wonderful wedding. It was of course the celebration of love. But a nice tribute to friendship too. Friendship as an opportunity to build a second family with the chance of the meetings. Just take your phone/your pen/your oven and send a text/a letter/a brownie to an old friend you didn’t saw for a long time.

-If you want to make the revolution (in science/politics or whatsoever stuff), drop me an email, we need to talk!

-The most powerful sentence I’ve heard these years: “Happiness is a state of mind”. It seems very simple, but I think it’s a part of the answer. When I am deeply sad, I tell myself that “my machine to see things in a positive way” is broken.

-The second most powerful sentence comes from the Listserve: “Try just one day not to give yourself excuses”. Do or don’t do things, but with a good reason!

If you are, congratulations! Like me, you are a part of a revolution -- a revolution that has been consuming millennials for the past week or so. It's burgeoning and staggering. But like every ""viral"" trend, either it will kill us or it will die out in a few weeks. Likely the latter. Quick poll: Who remembers planking, the Harlem Shake, or Gangnam Style? Yeah, I thought so.

Recently, my roommates and I have been discussing the value of virtual reality and augmented reality (an in-depth explanation of each can be found on Wikipedia). Pretty soon, you'll be able to have a meeting with potential clients who are located out of state, hang out with your grandma who lives across the country, or wander around that awesome vacation spot halfway across the world.

Yeah, I mean, I'm just your standard, 25-year-old guy living in Chicago. Yes, I grew up collecting Pokémon cards. No, I don't really know how to play the card/app game, I just like catching Pokémon. #TeamValor. We (yes, millennials -- people just looove talking about us) are trying to ""catch"" these virtual animals to collect or battle. This past weekend, it brought me and a friend to the Lincoln Park Zoo where -- ironically -- a girl dropped her phone into the meerkat exhibit while playing. But hey, at least we are walking around...right? Not only are we focusing on nothing, we are burning through precious data and battery life. Yeah, it's a huge problem.

But all sarcasm aside, the real valuable component about Pokémon is that it created the first real mass implication for augmented reality (for better or worse). And we will continue seeing new game and apps that get people out of their homes and exploring their neighborhoods. Or quite the contrary, TBD. Here's to a new and exciting generation of exploring your local, and hopefully not pissing off the meerkats.

Every day at noon the dining hall comes alive. People bring color to the room, and a symphony of banging pots, crunching apples, hushed conversations and heated discussions gives the space a voice.  As I walk towards the source of the mouth-watering aromas, I am not approaching the school cafeteria, but rather, my favorite classroom.

I wonder about two things: what’s on the menu and which topics will fuel today’s discussion. I sit around a table with an eclectic group, who are united through a call to explore interesting conversation. No teenage-girl gossip at this table (-maybe just a little).  Through these lunchtime dialogues I have realized that gaining new perspectives is often just as profound, if not more so, than acquiring new knowledge.

As the cafeteria gradually recedes into its dormant state, it signals the end of yet another lunch. I am always reluctant to leave, my appetite satiated, but my mind more hungry for the next day’s food for thought.

------ This is one of my favorite things I've written. I wrote it late at night for college admissions essays. The thing about that process is that you never get feedback. I'll never know if someone on the other end liked what I had to say (or even read it). Maybe they liked it, but rejected me. Maybe they hated it, but admitted me.

My favorite classroom contained my favorite part of high school - my best friends (the kind who stuck through you through your awkward years, when you were mean and didn't deserve them, and when you were betrayed).

I'm in grad school now. I used to wish I went to a different school for undergrad or studied something else - but hell, I wouldn't have met my uni best friend. And even if I didn't win one lottery, the odds of getting into ""insert-brand-name school"" were only 1/10 000, my best friend is one in 7.4 billion.

When I was 7 years old, my mother took me to a mall near Tampa, FL just before Christmas.  I got her to buy a little crystal pendant as a present from me.  The man at the jewelry kiosk wrapped the small box, took a little square of paper, and folded it into a crane to use as a bow on top. My mind was blown and I had to learn how to do that.  Now, more than 30 years later, paper folding is still one of my biggest hobbies, but it isn't just cranes and boxes.  There is an entire world of paper art that has grown and blossomed over the years.  I highly encourage you to check it out.  You will probably be surprised by what you find.  A good overview is the short documentary film, _Between the Folds_.

I also have a rant about ""origami purity"" and the idea that there are strict rules that define what is and isn't origami, but I won't type that here.  The idea has more with how the Western world decided to define origami, ""only one square, no cuts, no glue,"" rather than something intrinsic to the art. The short version is that you can and should impose whatever constraints on yourself that make you happy, but you shouldn't try to impose them on other people just because it doesn't fit in your ""box"".  Come to think of it, that has more general applications as well.

The other major hobby in my life is board gaming and it is plagued by misconceptions.  If you only thought about games like Risk, Monopoly, Candyland, and Chess when you read ""board gaming"", I would encourage you to spend a little bit of time exploring the landscape of modern games, starting with things like Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, Ricochet Robots, Pandemic, and Hanabi. Those games are a good place to start, although my personal preference bends toward luckless strategy games like Go, Food Chain Magnate, Age of Steam, and Roads and Boats.

Driving terrifies me.  It is the single most dangerous thing many people do on a regular basis.  Any time you are driving or near cars being driven, you life is in the hands of every person behind the wheel of a car.  Do what you can, and please consider following the two second rule for following distance.  Your reaction speed is not as good as you think it is.

One last thing. I try to live my life according to something akin to the golden rule, ""Don't unnecessarily inconvenience others.""  Hopefully I have not inconvenienced you.

And even though this is my industry – even though I am a participant, and I love the tools and strategies that are available to people now there is something going on that distresses me hugely.

I see it everywhere in the community. It’s on Twitter and Facebook, it’s in webinars and eBooks.

It’s deeply unkind and, in my opinion, deeply unwise.

Stop me if you’ve heard one of these:

*If people really value you, they’ll open their wallets for you.

*Most of the people on your list are losers who will never pay you – the important ones are the ones who can.

*Make sure you charge premium prices – you’ll REALLY be able to help people who can pay you enough.

*Outsource the boring work for as little as possible so YOU can do the high value stuff ONLY you can do.

All of this from people who almost unanimously say they want to change the world.

So I have to ask:

Who do they want to change the world FOR?

Let’s flip that script a little bit:

When someone earns $10 an hour, you can be very sure that that hour is valuable to them, and they are careful about how they will spend that limited resource – if it’s on you, be grateful.

There are many reasons someone might not have a lot of income to invest in coaching and training programs – none of them is that they aren’t talented, capable, creative or worthwhile.

There are considerably more people who can pay a little than can pay a lot. (And let’s be honest – that number is growing.)

I don’t have all of the answers. But I want to be having these conversations, and I want to see people asking themselves these questions.

As an entrepreneurial community are we really and truly comfortable with saying that those who have ready disposable income are better, more deserving, more talented and more capable than those who don’t?

Do you feel good about that statement?

Would you tweet it?

Would you post it on Facebook?

I want entrepreneurs – the people who are in the unique position of being able to challenge existing business models, create jobs, generate new products, systems and ideas – to consider that the culture of denigrating those who have less in favor of those who have more is a toxic one, and numbs us to the huge, systemic problems that exist in the world in favor of an idealized version of reality where people who are worth your time and energy are the ones who can pay you the most.

I’m not saying to stop selling $2000 products.

I’m not saying to stop charging rates for your work and time that allow you to support yourself and continue your business.

I’m not saying you should start giving away everything for free.

But I am asking you to stop talking about people who have less as if they are less valuable than people who have more, and start thinking, seriously, about how you measure value.

Language matters. The words we use to talk about things influence how we feel about them – and the more we talk about people who don’t have a lot of money as if they’re not worth our time, the less likely we are to question the way things are done now – and explore NEW ideas about how things CAN be done.

Hit reply and let me know what you think.

July 2016,20,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/07/20/this-world-is-over/,"July 2016, 20",This world is over,"This world is over.  Global capitalism has failed in its promise oflimitless prosperity.  Industry has succeeded only in destroying theclimate which keeps us alive.  Nation states are collapsing intofaux-democratic spectacles and open authoritarian regimes, neither ofwhich can fulfil their promises. But like a zombie, these systemspersist, rotting as they stumble on.  This world is dead, but it refusesto die.  It must be destroyed.

There is a new world waiting.  A world where we share and circulateresources, rather than hoarding them.  Where we participate inecosystems rather than exploiting them.  Where we govern ourselveswithout nations or leaders.  But this world isn't inevitable, it won'temerge naturally.  It must be built.

Destroying the old world and building the new one is the same project.We cannot do one without the other.  Allowing the old world to unraveland crash is not enough; it allows forces like racism, nationalism andfascism to blossom in the wreckage (see Golden Dawn and Donald Trump).And building new alternatives alone cannot challenge establishedsystems; that just creates new kinds of power which the ruling class cantwist to serve them (see Google and the grassroots Obama campaign).

This project of creation and destruction is epic in scale.  It is ourlast, best hope at a future of freedom and prosperity for the wholeplanet.  But it is also a humble project undertaken with our friends andfamily, our neighbors and co-workers.

We can build intentionally with those around us, creating alternativeinfrastructure and community.  Social centers run by neighborhoods.Cooperative businesses.  Public safety programs which don't involve thecops.  Communal childcare and education projects.  Sustainabletechnology initiatives.  Ways to take care of our needs together.

We can also destroy their world decisively: labor strikes, streetprotests, riots and road blockades.  Electronic disruption, hijackingmedia channels.  Theft and seizure of property.  Civil disobedience.Refusal to cooperate with military or police authorities.  Ways to clogthe machine and bring it down together.

I can't do all of these things, and neither can you.  But we can each dosome of them.  The key is to do what we can, but recognize our effortsas part of an epic project: identify our allies and support them.Identify our enemies and fight them. Sustainability hackers can buildoff-grid power for autonomous rural communes.  Commune farmers cansupply food to striking urban workers.  Church congregations can shelterrioters and rioters can loot supplies for the local free clinic.Separately, each of these efforts are weak and inadequate, butinterconnected we can stand against even the strongest authorities.This is not theoretical. It is happening in the world already, waitingfor you to pick a side.

I tell you this not because I think my words have much impact, butbecause as someone who has whole-heartedly invested in this project, itis the only significant thing I can think of to share.  If thisinterests you, check out ""To Change Everything"", or contact me at, including 'LISTSERV' in the subject line. I'd love totalk more.

My friends and I often joke that ""you can't fault a man for knowing what he likes,"" somewhat ironically at times. Because of course, one thing I like, and I think everyone should like, is trying new things and new experiences. Discovering a new things to like in the world around you and new things about yourself is thrilling and also lets you better understand others. That last sentence risked devolving into platitudes, so without further ado, here is a short list of things I like. My hope is that you might find something new to like on it, and you'll also be inspired to share one of your likes with me.

-Reading (Authors: David Foster Wallace, George Saunders, Roberto Bolano, Ta-Nehisi Coates, William H. Gass, Vladimir Nabokov, Junot Diaz, William Faulkner, Thomas Pynchon, Teju Cole, Alice Munro, Don DeLillo, Michelle Alexander - The New Jim Crow, ...)

-Listening to music and going to concerts (the Mountain Goats, Kamasi Washington - about to see him tonight!!, Protomartyr, Kendrick Lamar, Julien Baker, Titus Andronicus, Father John Misty, Sufjan Stevens, The Knife, Joanna Newsom, Burial, Flying Lotus, Run the Jewels, Trampled By Turtles, ...)

-card games and board games (Dominion, Carcassonne, King Mao, Catan, hearts, ...)

-playing goofy songs at open mic nights with my friends to provide comic relief for the people trying too hard

-eating pizza and drinking craft beer

-cooking new things with my girlfriend

-currently, playing pokemon go

-science (not in the flashy, clickbait-y way but in the beauty of incremental progress toward understanding the natural world a little better)

-faith (had to put this after science as a plug that yes, they are compatible, also the PC(USA) is awesome)

-TV, sparingly (Arrested Development, The Wire, Breaking Bad (and Better Call Saul), Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job, Mr. Show, ...)

-tennis (sadly, Federer looks like he's waning)

That about does it for me for now because I'm starting to get that solipsistic feeling that I am giving too much information about myself, assuming someone should have similar preferences to me. Best wishes and please email if something here resonates with you! Or if it doesn't, that's cool too.

As I'm writing in this coffee shop I overheard someone talking about their bone marrow transplant...He had his 26 years ago and was one of the first survivors of a non-related donor.  Mine was only 6 months ago. We just chatted for an hour. Someone recently plugged the national bone marrow registry on listserve and its worth saying again.

I looked up, and you startled me, but I'm fairly sure I had startled you first. We locked eyes, neither one of us wanted to make the first move. You were quite close, and normally I would continue on my way and let you be, but something about your gaze froze me... It made me want to enjoy this encounter just a little longer. I made myself smaller and crouched to the ground. I guess you took that as a safe sign to continue eating, but your constant glances back to me made it well known that you were still mindful of my presence. You walked further and further away, eating here and there, glancing and staring at me.I stood up and continued on my way, only to do the same and glance back several times until you disappeared into the forest.

I normally don't write such things, I don't really find myself creative in any type of medium. However, I wrote the above about an encounter with a deer on my most recent hike. 

I started hiking on and off in 2013, but I didn't treat it as a serious hobby until 2015. At the beginning of this year, I only made one concrete resolution for 2016: to complete 24 hikes. It didn't many the distance, it didn't matter if I repeated trails. All I wanted to do was to get out and hike more.

July 2016,14,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/07/14/on-freedom/,"July 2016, 14",On Freedom,"Greetings from Washington, DC, USA, on the Fourth of July. It seems fitting today to share a few reflections on liberty, or what I think it means to be free of external control. 

The bedrocks are the freedom to speak your mind; freedom to worship or not worship as you please; freedom to pursue the calling or career of your choosing; freedom to love whom you want, when you want; freedom generally to do as you like, so long as you don't harm others. We celebrate these basic freedoms while recognizing that not everyone enjoys them today, with the hope that they will be shared more universally in the future. 

I also think of freedom in other ways. Freedom means having the flexibility to structure your day as you please. It is a luxury to be free in this way, as many of us are forced to adapt to a schedule we don't fully control, whether for commuting, or running errands, or caring for others. If your life allows you to avoid rush hour, count yourself among the blessed.

Freedom means the ability to teach your values to your children, but also the choice to reject traditions or dogma that you don't like. Maybe that means disagreeing with your parents, or with your children. There is tension in embracing both sides. 

Freedom also comes from the absence of negativity. How many of us lack control over our thoughts about the past (regret, guilt, what-ifs, etc), the future (anxiety, stress), or other people (for example, unnecessarily harsh, rash judgments of strangers who happen to be bad drivers). It is truly freeing when those emotions are gone. But it's not easy, and for me it's an ongoing project to live in the present, look upon others without judgment, and minimize the internal negativity. 

The instant gratification of technology exerts its own form of control. So when it comes to our phones, freedom means the security to put them away when in the company of friends, or when driving. 

I hope you are able to celebrate your freedoms. And that you can live to make yourself, and others, more free. If any of this resonates with you, or if you'd like to share your view of freedom, you can reach me at  I will keep your message in confidence.

It was very different then as there wasn't a Silicon Valley or a big highway system, or even a fancy Napa Valley. My dad's family had moved to California in the early 1940's for work and as soon as he graduated high school he went into the army. He was lucky since it was the end of the war and he was shipped out to Germany where things were finished rather than the pacific. He came back, went to Berkeley on the GI bill, graduated, married my mom who was 19, he was 25. He went to work for one of his fraternity brother's father who was selling scarves that he got from NYC. They were approached by a guy who knew nothing about the accessories industry to design a scarf that would be made in Japan and then imported to the U.S.. They created a scarf out of designs from postcards sold to tourists. It went to Japan and then back to U.S. It sold out in one day at the City of Paris Department Store mainly to the GIs in SF now returning from Korea. They continued to import silk scarves from Japan until it became too expensive and then knitwear from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and other Asian countries. They became the knock off artists, buying expensive designer sweaters, tweaking them and creating goods for the masses. After I recently interviewed my Dad who at 88 still gets up everyday and goes to work for a few hours, I searched eBay for the scarf with the postcards, I was rewarded  recently with one which I will frame.I love to sew and knit. I also needlepoint, crochet, embroider and quilt. I love being a ""maker."" I think this came from growing up with someone in the fashion industry as well as the lineage on my mother's side where my great grandfather was a tailor in Oakland in the early part of the 20th century and my grandmother taught me handwork. I have traveled to learn from skilled knitting teachers around the world. Handwork is something that gives me pleasure and has been an important facet of my life during difficult times. I always have a project with me. My 3 children, husband, family and friends all own work from my hands. It will be my legacy.Today I am learning to row which I love since I grew up before Tile IX and didn't have the chance to do team sports. Read about it if you have never heard of it. I have practiced yoga for decades which brings me peace. I cook good food and enjoy having people gather at my table. I went back to school and got my BA and Masters while raising my family. My first career was as an RN in the O.R. when I was in my 20's. Now I am director of a small museum.Come and visit the Metropolitan Waterworks Museum in Boston.

My final words for the listserve are never stop challenging yourself and learning. It provides you with a rich life and opportunities to meet interesting people and see the world. Learn to do something with your hands, it will be a lifelong skill that you will be glad you have. Be kind, polite and generous. If you have been fortunate to have opportunities, remember those that have not. Help to create a peaceful world without prejudice.

As we were driving to their village, my dad noticed a car in the ditch next to the road in a very tricky corner. He decided to stop to ask if everything is ok. He pulled over and opened the door to step outside. The moment he steps out, a car going from the opposite direction skids and crashes right into him. He spends the next 4 months lying unconscious in the hospital, my mum visiting him regularly, before he passes away. I still can't even imagine what she must have gone through. I was too young to realise, and I cannot even remember any of this. She didn't have this privilege.  

The lesson here is clear, life is not fair. Even the purest of intentions can turn into the grimmest of outcomes. Being good can literally kill you. It just begs to wonder how many people die each year thanks to the consequences of doing good deeds, or live their whole lives dedicated to other people that may often not even realise it. The poor souls that put happiness of others above their life. We can just ask and wonder why on earth these people can't just be selfish and live their own lives happily. Had my dad been more selfish, he could've been here now. He could've seen me graduate from university and he could've been here and enjoy all the latest tech gadgets that he loved so much back then. 

The conclusion is very inviting. Why should we be trying to help others when we can happily live our own lives? Why should we care about strangers at all? I, personally, know why. Because someone so close to me lost his life trying to help others. Becoming selfish just out of spite would make my father's death become meaningless. Therefore, every time I do my small bit of good and help a stranger with their suitcase, or stroller, I think of my dad. I know these are menial little things, but I do hope they still count. And I hope that one day I'll even have enough courage to pull over and help a stranger stranded on the side of the road. Until then, shall I help you carry that suitcase up the stairs?

 How about you? What makes you care about others? And how do you show it?

P.S. All I am going for with this email is to give some recognition to my father, whom I only got to know very briefly, but who deserves it immensely. I just wish one day I could be at least half as kind as him. And also to my mum, who I admire for being able to go through this all. And for being able to drive through that unfortunate curve, again, and again, week after week. I honestly wonder, how she can be so strong.

I was a lifelong hopeless romantic when I first watched it, I fell in love with my girlfriend then at first sight. I believed in walking under the stars, wordlessly immersing in the presence of the other, falling in love like it was part of some grand destiny.

I left that relationship with a broken heart, a damaged soul, and I emerged out of it with a growing cynicism – if she was not the one, then nobody else would be.

---

I sought to form a committed relationship with my work instead, who needs romance when there is one's life's work? Work doesn't abandon. I rolled my eyes watching Scandal, when the leader of the free world wanted to choose his love of his life over the world. I judged him, and I judged people around me when they chose love over purpose. Why love a person when you can love the world?

---

She arrived in my life like a bubble. I resisted her with all my might, and gave us a thousand reasons why it wouldn't work. Putting out my baggage in full view, I was unconsciously putting out a dare for her, to love me. I was too broken, and she, too whole. I broke her heart by telling her I sought meaning, not happiness, that I can no longer put anyone else above my life's work.

---

I didn't realize how many walls I had around my heart until she came along. I wasn't aware how cynical I had become by trying to push away the only person who tried to love me with her heart, without drama, without mind games – does a person like this still exist in this reality? It was as if I have won the lottery and I was desperately trying to reject the winnings.

I had done so well before her. I learned to be alone, to immerse myself in an inner-world so rich I didn't feel like I needed anyone. I have survived without that sort of love that makes the heart aglow, that the unexpected arrival of it felt more like poison than a gift. I had unknowingly become a person who sees all good things as future threats.

She stayed, despite me. I let her love me, and she did, in the most generous way possible. I had lost count of all the ones who had broken me because they too, were trying to escape from love. Her love was whole and it threatened me more, because I was used to trying to find light in the darkest corners, instead of dealing with unadulterated bright light.

I had gotten the plot wrong. That it wasn't me who dared her to love me. It was her, all along, who dared me to love her, to develop the courage and capacity to love a love so whole that it would utterly break me:

""Love, then, is less a utility and more a preemptive form of grief. Allowing something to matter is simply another way of saying you’re going to care when it’s gone."" – Helena Fitzgerald

---

She returned me to my self, the hopeless romantic. She has softened me enough, to see that I couldn't truly be effective with my life's work anyway, if I couldn't open my heart to wholeness and light, to rediscover what it feels like to carry hope once again.

It is one of the things that make me one in a million. What is more, is that my path to get here and my future make me even more distinct. I was born in 1995 to woman who is beyond loving and stubborn. My mother, and my dad have been a truly driving force in my life. As a child, I was often very sick and truly no one expected my to live to the age of five. So as you can image we had a heck of a party when I turned 15. On top of being sick and allergic to just about everything (trees, grass, dust, dander, etc. ... the list of things I am not allergic to is way shorter), I also have learning disabilities. However as I am sure you understand none of those things stopped me. Don’t get me wrong, they made and still make life very difficult. But after a great deal of hard work and help from a number of phenomenal people, I have been able to make something of myself. I graduated from high school at the age of 16, and earned my B.S. in business by 19. A year ago I started my MBA, and now I have it at the grand old age of 20. It has been one heck of a roller coaster but where I am headed next is an even bigger journey. My next step... a doctorate in Psychology. You see, I want to develop the resources and the knowledge around how people think. This idea for a thesis dissertation is something I created five years ago, and I am now pursuing it. I am getting the classes I need through the next year, and then I am jumping into a five-year program that will help me explain my ideas. My ambition is to create a career around my thesis but to also expand the research available about people with learning disabilities and autism. I previously mentioned my mother who has been a driving force in my life, well, she has Asperger’s which is on the autism spectrum. My baby brother is autistic as well. And I know many more people than I count on two hands that have either learning disabilities or autism. Each one of these people is dear to my heart, and having a chance to give back to them is a reward all its own. Someday I hope to share my ideas with others, and influence discussion that will someday impact change. I might be 10 years from seeing this goal become a reality but I know I will fight tooth and nail to have that opportunity. My life has been nurtured by those who have helped me, and someday I will nurture others by helping them. Thank you for reading my story, and please feel free to email me! Have a beautiful day. Peace be with you,Angela R.

My partner didn’t want a dog, I did.  But as the years past, he wanted a dog and I didn’t.  He didn’t want dirty paws in his bed, or slobbery licking.  I was worried it would chew on papers I like to have stacked neatly on the floor.  We both worried it would pee on our beige carpeting, and leave hair and fuzz all over the house.

29 years later, we converged; we both wanted a dog.

But we had requirements, lots of them.

We wanted a dog that didn’t bark.  We wanted a dog that didn’t shed.  We wanted a dog that didn’t go to the bathroom, that didn’t drool, that didn’t chew on furniture, that didn’t eat shoes or paper, a dog that would never get dirty or lick, or throw-up in the car. I wanted to dog that liked to be cuddled and would sit in my lap, and my partner wanted one that likes to go on long walks. We were worried about getting a rescue dog because we didn’t want it to have psychological issues.

We wanted a RoboDog; a manufactured dog that would meet every single one of our requirements, the perfect dog that would not make a mess and could do no wrong.  A dog that would give lots of love, and require no care.

Our friend who is a professional dog handler, suggested some stellar purebreds, but we determined they come with their own sets of issues.  We read, and researched, and googled, looking for the magical mix of dog, and how to make it our own.

Eventually we narrowed down the choices to Maltese/Poodle and Bichon/Poodle for their combination of temperament, lack of shedding, and intelligence.  Since these dogs aren’t purebred, we decided to take the risk on a rescue dog.

We checked out the local No Kill shelter who told us these “designer breeds” are snatched up by local rescue organizations, so we emailed one of them.  We received a response with a photo of Margo, an adorable 2-year-old female “bichon-poo”.  We made plans to meet 2-days later, 1-hour away at a dog park.

The next evening during dinner we joked with our friends that we were going to pick up our new daughter in the morning, in reality having no idea if we’d really end up with this dog.

When we arrived at the dog park, it was love at first sight.  Margo came right up to us with a big doggy smile on her face. We didn’t know what else to do but to say, “OK.” After a lot of paperwork and instructions from the owner of the rescue organization, we were walking back to the car with Margo on a leash.  As we left the park, Margo was faced with a decision.  Would she try to follow the owner of the rescue organization back to her car, or willingly go with us?  Without any hesitation, she chose us, and marched confidently towards her new life.

She buried her head in my arms and quietly waited to be transported to her new home.

We believe that our silly notion of the perfect “RoboDog” went out into the universe, and somehow manifested into the discovery of Margo.

She doesn’t bark.She doesn’t shed.She potties rarely, and always waits until it’s time to go outside.She never drools.She loves her dog toys, but never harms them.  She picks them up gently, and moves them about, but none has ever been torn nor damaged in any way.She never bites, only occasionally offering a loving nibble.She never touches paper, in fact, one of her only fears is the sound of paper.She has no interest in shoes.She doesn’t dig, so rarely gets dirty.She has gorgeous eyes that peer directly into yours.She has a marvelous personality, the perfect balance of energy and calm.She gives lots of love, loves to be cuddled, and enjoys sitting in my lap.And when my partner mentions a “walk”, Margo squeals with excitement, and is happy to walk for miles and miles.

I can’t overemphasize the joy of living with this magical, perfect RoboDog.  Margo has now lived with us a year, and all three of us couldn’t be happier.

So please, don’t wait any longer. Google PETFINDER and FIND A DOG TO ADOPT now.  It’s heartbreaking how many of these loving spirits need a home, so if you have one to give, please share yours with one of them, you’ll be glad you did.

But experiences are impossible to manufacture and even harder to replicate on paper. So till we get to the next level, here's a quick story about one of my experiences

The Red Earth

Welcome to Kinshasa!! Keep your head down, lie flat in the car and keep your bags beside you. That’s the first sentence said to me as I get out of N’djili airport at the democratic republic of Congo. As I leave the airport five bodyguards with guns bigger than me surround me towards my bullet proof car. The driver zips off as soon as my head hits the ground. On the way to the brewery I try to take several peaks out the window. All I can see are red flames dancing over burning houses and all I hear are rounds of ammunition being fired not unlike when the drops of the African monsoon hit the tin laden shanties. Kinshasa is burning. President Kabila has just been reelected and it seems that not many people are happy with that. While all this is happening I’ve got three months to try and sell beer to the very people who are trying to burn every moving vehicle, including mine. That shouldn’t be difficult considering war and beer have had an intimate relationship akin to Romeo and Juliet.

As I enter the expat district, things change dramatically. Straight clean roads are being patrolled with armored vehicles patrolling the streets. There’s lighting, open shops and even many locals walking around not trying to kill me. “We are safe now grand chef’ Ilnyas, my driver says to me. “you can come out now”.  I tentatively sit up straight and light up my Dunhill’s with my trembling hands. We reach the brewery. An opulent gate opens up to a vast landscape of beauty. A line of tall buildings come into my vision, followed quickly by rows and rows of picturesque European row houses with manicured gardens, a large swimming pool, basically the works. I reach my row house. I enter with 5 bedrooms and 3 butlers all waiting to do my bidding. “My oasis in hell” I say to myself. Heineken definitely makes you live king-size.

Over the next three months I scoured the city, flanked by my AK laden guards and tried to sell as much beer as I could across roads so uneven that the roads of Bangalore would feel like a dream. Across districts filthy with dust, dirt, garbage and excrete all mixed together creating a medley of stench stronger than that of urea. Small children with big guns, big men with even bigger bottles and big women with their bruised laden bodies converge together to create an almost surreal environment. It’s no wonder the Congolese say “God left Africa the day he left Kinshasa”.

Among all the chaos the only soothing sense is the ear. Everywhere you can hear it. The sounds of the music of Africa. The sounds of people trying to survive. The sounds of defiance.

These people have seen violence for 60 years. Since the Belgians left, many pillagers have come and raped this beautiful country. But the people survived. They rebuild and rebuild till another catastrophe washes everything away after which they build again.

As I am leaving Kinshasa, the Congolese of the brewery all want me to take a picture with them at the gate. It kinda looks like the picture hanging in the CEO’s office of Freddy Heineken, the founder of Heineken, who first came to Kinshasa 60 years ago to open the brewery.

Then as now everyone is smiling. The palm trees are swinging wildly and the red soil is jumping up, leaving translucent layers of African dust on our clothes. And then as now the situation is the same. The earth is still red, made so by the blood of Africa

Intellectual Giftedness, that is…","Hi, My Name Is J.!Or, @JRoc23, on Twitter, if you're open like me & need a quick character check. Some background context, on who the heck is writing this shit.

You see, I see Twitter, the social @ originator, as a resource:

1) Internet consciousness. Current Real Time Events, News, Ideas, Sports, Pictures, Random Observations, Trends. It fulfils my many interests.2) I can ask, Who is this? Do we click? Or are they a prick?3) It exercises Empathy. Provides perspectives. Because diversity is strength.

So yes, I suggest Following as many accounts as you can. You'll learn something new. Listen To Many! (Speak To Few.)Oh, & D) It's an underrated Search Engine.

Speaking of which, I'm collaborating on another Twitter side project.@REAL_JOBS_YTO, if you're looking for, in the beautiful city of Toronto.

As I am, continuing to try, & find my career calling.

Sharing REAL JOBS, found through Tweets, from real people! Unlike bland faceless morale crushing job boards, or fakeass social networks like ~$26 Billion LinkedIn. Twitter keeps it real.

***

Ah yes, & ""Gifted""…

The commonly known short form, of ""Intellectual Giftedness"".

Which yes, I also explore on Twitter, @THE_REAL_GIFTED. Because, Gifted is real… preconceived misconceptions aside.

Essentially, I was 1 of those Gifted kids in classes. You may remember them. You may even be 1 of them, labelled GIFTED! AND NEVER talk about it. Which I get. & Why, I talk about it.

Because funny enough, I ended up dropping out of Gifted school. A failed academic.In addition to Failed Actor, Failed Ball Player, Failed Show Coordinator, Failed You Get The Idea. Failed Writer.

It was only after, that I actually realized, that it was Gifted 4 LIFE.

You see, Gifted kids are different, & complex. Asynchronous development with a mental capacity advanced beyond age expectations, maybe displayed outwardly. Those who do display, are labelled Gifted, in school. Basically, they're extra smart.

What they didn't teach us as kids was the side effects of Intellectual Giftedness. Mental Health, unaddressed. This Double Edged Sword includes things like: ADHD, Anxiety, Dyslexia, Existential Depression, High Sensitivity, Imposter Syndrome, Loneliness, OCD, Schizophrenia, Etc, Etc.

So let's just say, I'm glad my boy, the Prime Minister Of Canada, J. Trudeau, is getting around to Legalizing Marijuana.

Because yes, there is more than just an IQ. Like, how you handle, how you feel.

Also, I think there's something to Gardner's ""Theory of Multiple Intelligence""; It's a new way to view IQ… analogous to the Moneyball Revolution in Baseball? There is meaningful context, than just the numbers & statistics.

Anyways, keep Gifted curriculum in schools. But just like the status quo, it could use reform.

***

These days, it's Twitter, helping intellectually stimulate me. Eating lunch, standing in line, perusing while driving. Yes, I know.

They say, You Follow People on Twitter That You'd Like To Know, You Friend People On Facebook You Hate To Know. (Why no, I'm not on evilbook. Like Mr. Robot, I hate facebook.)

& If I may, some random, parting tweet-sized thoughts:

Empathy, Empathy, EMPATHY.The Golden Rule, Rule Of Reciprocity.Exercise Critical Thinking, & Understanding Context. ""Why, Is This True?""There is an exception to every rule.The world isn't just black & white.My cognitive dissonance dances around destiny, faith, luck, opportunity.I love The Rock. & Scarlett Johansson. If anyone knows them?

If you've made it this far, which I admit I don't usually get—Know that I'll now go through, the inbox, & Twitter, & read everything #THEListserve.

Respect.

July 2016,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/07/01/glug-no-its-not/,"July 2016, 01",Glug. No it's not.,"Glug. No it's not. You've been reading too much output from the Robert Amsterdam propaganda mill. Robert Amsterdam is a paid political lobbyist who specializes in character assassination of politicians and movements opposed to his client. He likes to pitch himself as a ""human rights activist"" but he simply uses human rights as one tool in his portfolio for harassing his client's rivals. At the moment, Robert Amsterdam is being paid by Thaksin Shinawatra so everything he says and does is determined by the need to promote the interests of his client. Since both the client and the interests are very unsavory, this requires substantial prevarication and obfuscation.

Before going into what's been happening in Bangkok this year, some background is essential. Not just on Thaksin Shinawatra himself but also on Thai politics in general. Let's start with Thaksin. The man is a billionaire who made his pile getting sweetheart deal contracts from the Thai Government for work in modernizing Thai telecommunications infrastructure. He was also a Lieutenant Colonel in the Thai Police. When he first entered politics, his act was quite revolutionary. Normally a Thai political campaign consists of the candidate publishing lists of worthy people who support him. In effect, they provide lists of references that more or less state ""I am a good person and can be trusted to work in your interests."" People then voted for whoever paid them the most. In Thailand, it's quite possible to have a worthwhile debate on whether vote buying is wrong or not. Thaksin changed that. He conducted a western-style campaign that put a portfolio of promised policies out and invited people to judge his party on the basis of those policies. This was so different that it worked rather well. His Party became the largest in the Thai Parliament and he pushed through the items on his agenda (low cost medical care, low-interest loans for farmers and a few other things, all calculated to endear himself to the rural population - note still buying votes but wholesale rather than retail and using Government money to do it). When the next election came up, his party wasn't just the largest one, it actually had an overall majority.

This made Thaksin's real objectives critical. Thaksin is (or was) a great admirer of the Singaporean model of government and industry. He wanted to create a new Thai state in which there was a single party (controlled by him) and a single corporate entity (controlled by him). The fact that Singapore doesn't really work that way is neither here nor there. Thaksin wanted a state where there was no center of government or economic power that was outside his control. With a majority in Parliament, he set about achieving just that. Hold that thought.

Now, let's look at Thai politics. Thailand is an odd place; it's one of the few countries in the world where the political establishment openly says ""we're politicians, don’t trust us."" There is an ongoing presumption in the country that political shakeups should never be seen in terms of black and white. The message is to look with skepticism on political changes and to assume that all political movements are corrupt and tainted by greed and ambition. There is an assumption that all are backed by a hidden hand that is pushing a secret agenda. This is an intensely cynical view of course, and one that leaves no room to suppose that a protest is both genuine and sincere.

It is Father’s Day in the UK this Sunday so it’s a poignant time.  Since winning I’ve questioned if I really do want to share it with strangers on the internet. People can be pretty hash, what if I get loads of people telling me I shouldn’t have done it?  Then I thought that I don’t really care; It was *my* decision, and it was right for me at the time. So here goes…---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Firstly, I want you to know that it is really painful for me to write this, and secondly that I’ve given it considerable thought.I am writing to ask you not contact me again. Perhaps in the future I will contact you, but for now, I think this is for the best. There are a few things you should know that have led me to this decision.In 2009, before I moved to Edinburgh I was really depressed and the Doctor prescribed me with anti-depressants and referred me to a counsellor. We talked quite a lot about things that happened when I was growing up, mainly between you and me.  After discussing quite a few things that have always stuck with me and upset me, the counsellor asked me what I wanted to do about it, and we decided that I would wipe the slate clean and move on. I was scared of getting hurt again, and so decided that I would give you three more chances.I made a promise to myself and [my partner] that I would stick to that. Sadly, I think you’ve had the three chances now.[I then gave examples of those three chances which I don’t want to share as they are… private. I appreciate the irony of that sentence. They were along the lines of selfish behaviour, general disinterest in my life/achievements, bigoted/racist behaviour and general rudeness. I would disassociate with ‘friends’ who behave in that way, so why not a parent?]Those three chances were intended to last the rest of your life, and they’re now gone in a matter of months.  These three things are just three examples of times that I have felt sad, upset or angry because of something that has happened. This letter isn’t just about those three things; it is the sum of everything that has happened over the years.I don’t profess to be an angel, but I think you should know I have always been loyal to you; I have always given you another chance. For as far back as I can remember, I get upset after almost every conversation we have, and yet I have always tried to have a relationship with you as I genuinely do want a Dad. Also, having the counselling made me realise that you had an unusual childhood, and perhaps you are now a product of that youth. That’s what made me decide to wipe the slate clean and try again, but I think that only worked once, and there’s only so many chances you can give someone, regardless of what kind of past they have.  I’m really sad to say that I’m not capable of repeatedly feeling upset/pissed-off/sad/angry with you for the things you do, or more importantly, don’t do. And, I need to think about myself, I need to be my priority.You seem to be really happy with [your partner], and seem to have a good relationship with [her daughter], although for years you told me you didn’t. I hope the same can be said for [her other daughter, husband and grandchild].  I genuinely hope that continues, and you maybe even one day get married. That would be lovely.It pains me to send this, but I know I have to. I’m sorry.

-------------------------------------------------------------------5 (ish) years later, I have spoken to him a handful of times. Sadly there have been a few family funerals and so I’ve had to contact him to let him know. We’ve discussed meeting to talk things through, and I’ve said yes and left the ball in his court, but then never heard from him again.Some things never change.

A blind taste test featuring different brands of common food items, sent out in a monthly mailing. Not the next sliced bread, but still, it was cool. The next day we went to the grocery store to explore the idea further. We spent 3 hours arguing, and in the end we agreed: no one would buy this.

Monique and I had been dating for 3 months at this time. We were both recent college graduates, and we resented our corporate jobs. They were good jobs and we had worked hard to get them, but we both wanted more. We knew it was angsty and millennial, but still, it was how we felt! We first bonded over Shark Tank, and we finished our first date making out as the credits rolled.

We were nervous to work on something together, but knew that we would hold each other accountable. The next 3 weeks were spent researching similar ideas to the taste test box. After much discussion, we decided on an idea: snacks from a different country delivered monthly.

We had $2,000 to get it started. All summer we huddled up in my apartment, working nights and weekends to build our website, create our brand, and find our suppliers. In October, we launched the website. On our first day we got 5 orders, all from friends and family.

One night, a month after launching, I was surfing the internet late at night, looking for places to post about our product. I came upon a subreddit (category of a user-submitted content website) called “Shut Up and Take My Money”. I posted a link to our product: “Snacks from a Different Country, Delivered Monthly”. Then I went to bed.

Per my usual routine, I grabbed my phone to check orders as soon as opened my eyes. We had 30 new orders, doubling our customer base overnight. Heart racing, I shook Monique awake and we celebrated. I spent the entire day at my corporate job refreshing my inbox, watching the number creep up.

The next few months were filled with lots of late nights and lots of mistakes.

We were so cheap that instead of customer boxes or stickers, we bought a rubber stamp to put our logo on white boxes. The stamp had to be cleaned with rubbing alcohol every 3 boxes, and I had to press down so hard to get the stamp to work that my hands were constantly bruised.

Since we were at our jobs all day we had no way to receive product from our suppliers, so we had it shipped to the UPS store. We jammed hundreds of snacks into our cars and drove them to my apartment. We didn’t have tables, so we laid the products out on sofas and chairs to set up an assembly line. We packed boxes for days, backs aching, until my apartment was filled to the brim.

It’s been 2 years since we started the business. Last March, we quit our corporate and moved into a small office. A few months later, we couldn’t pack the boxes ourselves anymore, so we found a logistics company to help us. At the beginning of this year we moved to New Jersey to be closer to the port. Now we rent a big warehouse, and we’re hiring our first full-time employees. We’ve come a long way, and still have a long way to go. But most importantly, Monique and I are still in love.

One of my big beliefs as a kid was that there was no such thing as a quiet person, just a situation that made them quiet or where they could/would not speak.

I challenge each any every one of you to go wild, to talk to whoever, whenever for as long as you want saying anything and everything that comes to mind without fear of judgement or consciousness of audience.

How many of my generation right now have real, REAL friends? Not a squad or a clique, but someone or some people who you can interact with without censoring yourself at all… I’m sure many do and many do not. and that proportion is something fluid, changing by changes in perspective, by meeting new people and reconnecting with parts of yourself or others that you hadn’t in a while.

A friend of mine while exploring an interest in the innocence project recently said that the death sentence reduces the entirety of a human being, their love, their curiosity, generosity, spice, tenacity, chutzpah, talent, and opportunity for anything and reduces it to the worst thing they’ve ever done. This is my interpretation, but the statement was originally “a person is not the worst thing they’ve ever done” and thus by sentencing a person to death, you hone in on the worst thing they’ve ever done and make everything else meaningless in sentencing that person to death.

I think the most perfect thing in the world is an imperfect idea. Because when people hear it, everyone has something to say about it, ways its wrong, its right, can be improved or is offensive. Maybe it’s just a way of giving arbitrary value to a series of unfinished thoughts thats lead me to say this but I think there’s immeasurable value in giving people the feeling that they can and know how to change and improve on something. I think unfinished, sporadic crazy thoughts give people that ability sometimes.

I just started a new job, and i can tell you that saying a nice thing, taking interest in someone else’s world, doing something, ANYTHING, that shows that you’re a little interested in their existence, and saying it with confidence, makes a huge difference in your life and the other persons.

A girl I know described her experience with a guy she just started dating as constantly being saved at the last minute, as in this guy would do or say a series of things she didn’t really connect to or love and then just as things were waning, he said or did something that she really understood/connected with and it saved the relationship bringing the chemistry back up to the stars. Just hearing that characterization

Remember that the right advice for your professional development is likely very different and might even oppose the right advice for your personal happiness, development, wellbeing whatever buzzword you use that carries the least amount of BS in your mind.

I’m scared that as I’m growing up I’m seeing less and less of the world and of people and i want to get to the root of it the way a doctor diagnoses a patient with a rare but identifiable virus.

I don’t know if I’ve always been anything but i know i’ve always been someone who teetered between the more patronizing “Philosophical” and the less challenging “wise.” (Less challenging in that recognizing someone as wise feels to me like less of a challenge, because it supposedly recognizes something you’ve said as valuable, but doesn’t move along the conversation or idea.

Years ago when I first devised a plan to write for the listserve i told myself that what the world needed was more honesty. i deeply believe that nothing bad can happen when you’re just honest. This evening, I took that to mean giving something unfiltered to show people where my thoughts are on any given day (which albeit is probably a weird way to interpret honesty and may not even be that). I know I could have said something more helpful professionally, or do my best to put on my DFW hat and get you all to think differently about something surprising and awe inspiring but also right under your noses, but I didn’t and I hope that some of you still enjoyed it.Last but certainly not least I want to thank the following past writers for your emails. They’ve inspired be, humbled me, brought me up when i felt down, exposed me to a new literary voice and given me endless inspiration.

Questions:

Do you think there is a right time for something to come up in conversation at a point when it’ll carry the most weight? What about in professional situation or with a therapist? What thing in life do and don’t exist on a spectrum (Sexuality, gender, Depression, Anxiety, Success etc.) Is there anything you see as absolute? Do you think you can entertain these thoughts in your current life striving for professional success of personal satisfaction?

When was the last time you had a deep conversation with your parents about what it was like for them raising you? There's the historical facts, but what about the meaning behind the meaningful experiences?

I wonder how many people see their parents as human beings doing their best, each moment to moment.

It’s a special gift for a parent to create that conversation with their child when they age into adulthood. That conversation empowers the child to own their lives and to look at their childhood compassionately. I think that conversation is the most powerful source for being compassionate to ourselves and others.

It can be hard to articulate sometimes, so I'm making an app called Lifechime, to help parents chime in about what it's like as they raise their children as early as pregnancy, and create that gift in a format that can endure their child’s teens, 20’s and 30’s, available no matter what happens.

Within parents and children connecting deeply, what I care about most is for children who lose a parent at a young age to be able to know - who was their mom or dad, what does mom see in her child's eyes and want for her child, and to really know the unconditional love that is there and everlasting.

Either way, I think it'll be a real treasure for both parent and child to review these moments through different stages of life. And funny to review too, like in the way we laugh at ourselves for what we used to get excited or worry about.

I invite you to ask your parents what it was like, and if you have a little one, turn the camera around and save a little bit of this moment for them. I'm curious whether or not this was impactful for you. Please drop me a note.

Warmly yours in being

    The stark contrast of her burnt red jacket against the massive brushed metal wall first caught my eye. As I watched, her gaze wandered from the curved ceiling to the 40-foot glass doors, and the city that seemed to open just beyond them. I recognized on her face the sense of awe and appreciation that had struck me in my gut the second I walked into the space, and with this oddly joyful weight in my stomach, I walked up to her.

    I asked if I could take her picture, and with a muted smile, she agreed. I framed the shot on the screen of my iPhone took the picture. She told me she had been standing in the same spot for 3 hours in awe, and I couldn't help but smile and laugh. I laughed because that was the same response I was having to the pure and intentional design that surrounded us.

   We wandered the space for an hour, talking about the incredible power of design to convey a message, an emotion, a viewpoint. As we neared the end of our conversation, she said this:

   “It only takes a moment to discover a soulmate connection, and I feel like we shared something like that just now”.

   Even as I write this I am still realizing how accurate this word choice was. We connected through our love of architecture and creative expression, an instinctual connection.

   Although I may never see her again, that experience gave me a new way of thinking about friendships and relationships. By no means do I completely understand how I see this new approach and I’m still giving it thought, but I like the way this mindset makes me feel.

   I am going into my final year at the George Washington University in Washington DC, currently living in Berkeley, California.

If you are in the area, lets meet up! I love showing people some of my favorite hidden spots thought the Bay, and am more than up for discovering some new ones as well!

Here are a couple of thoughts to leave you with:

Upon reaching a new city, or if you just want to explore a familiar one, try following green lights.

 I’ve recently been thinking about the future of transport, both individual vehicles and large-scale systems. I have some ideas, but I would love to hear from you!

 Anxiety. Complex, hidden, paralyzing.

I recently rediscovered my love for hiking. If you live in the Bay Area, try the Marin Headlands. Out-of-this-world views, and I always feel like I find a new path.

I believe that beauty lives in everything, all that it takes to see it is a clear perspective.

I would love to hear from you! I am always open to a good conversation, or to brainstorm creative and disrupting projects.

Thank you so much for your time!

June 2016,25,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/06/25/no-subject/,"June 2016, 25",[no subject],"In 2011, I started designing indie tabletop roleplaying (RPG) games.

No, not computer games. Tabletop games. Like Dungeons & Dragons. Games with funny dice. Games in which you and your friends sit around a table and pretend to be elves or dwarves or whatever.

My first game (The Play's The Thing) was about Shakespearean actors. I always thought Ophelia got a bad shake. What if the actors who were playing the parts got to argue with the director? 

My second game (Our Last Best Hope) was about the end of the world. I always love the last session of a long-running game when all the chips are down and the heroes have to overcome impossible odds.

After a few years of designing games, I started having conversations with people in the community about representation. And as a Mexican-American designer, I had a terrifying thought: no one could look at my games and know anything about my life or my history or my family.

As far as anyone knew...I was another white guy game designer.

I immediately had another disheartening thought: I have no idea what a Mexican-American game looks like.

***Fast forward: four years later. I've got a bunch of credits. I worked on the new Firefly RPG, wrote a bunch for other gaming systems, and designed an urban fantasy game called Urban Shadows. And as I'm working and designing, I'm thinking about these four-year-old questions: 

What makes a game Mexican?Does this kind of game even matter?Am I Mexican enough to write it?

I float stupid ideas, like a game about a farm in northern Mexico where you play an ordinary family. (That idea even bored me, and that's not a good sign for a new game.) And I keep designing and trying things and working on stuff. Nothing fits. I start to think that maybe I'm not supposed to do this kind of work. Leave it to the next Mexican.

***I'm from Albuquerque. I can't go anywhere or do anything without someone asking me about Breaking Bad. And for a long time, I avoided the show. I grew up there (and live there now). I don't need to see it on screen.

But I hear it's good, so I start watching it. And it's better than good. It's amazing. And it captures my city. (Mostly. I still have issues with an ABQ show that's completely focused on white folks). But it blows my mind. It's so tight and dramatic and funny and... everything I love about crime fiction.

Then it clicks. My game needs to be like this. And it needs to center on Mexico. On the cartels. On the horrific violence that's spread over the border like a wildfire, that threatens to throw a generation of people into darkness. On stuff that matters.

And that's when I started writing Cartel. A game about the people whose lives are caught up in the drug war, for better or worse.

Spoiler: it's usually worse.

***

It's not done yet. I released an early version last August, but my other projects keep me busy. I've gone through about 10 iterations of it, and I'm feeling like it's close to done. It's like The Wire meets Breaking Bad meets Once Upon a Time in Mexico.

Heartbreaking. Beautiful. Tense. Tragic. 

It's the best damn work I've ever done. It's not easy or pretty or safe. But it's the game I had inside me four years earlier that I couldn't see. And (as it nears completion) it makes me wonder what comes next in my story.

June 2016,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/06/24/salt-water-burns/,"June 2016, 24",Salt water burns,"Another wave crashes down. Under a tumbling wave the salt water fizzles and burns every pore. Full panic. My legs kick and kick and in the darkness I can only hope I’m going up towards oxygen.

My lungs ache a little. They get acclimated. They recover from the depths. I’m a little confused, abruptly moving from chaos into safety. Even though my body is still trembling under the water, the sun shines my hair and warms my cheeks above the water. My lungs are full and it makes me smile.

I feel this often. After exams; after moving from one home to another; one country to another; after leaving graduation as a post-grad but entering into another kind of grad. I wave to my friends with jobs who live in independence where they put hours into projects like CommuniGift. They utterly live for someone else. They are committed to goodness that they haven’t seen but absolutely see. Vision for the not-yet is faith.

But even in the mundane I’m still working from faith. Even in my walk to the one place I can go to start my day and think clearly at 6am every morning in Chiang Mai, Thailand. It is consistently open and has free 4-hours of wifi with the purchase of an overpriced espresso that makes me bitter. But the air conditioning, oh, the air conditioning. I’ve realized it is the real secret ingredient to S-V-O… not all-nighters or office hours or memorization. The first time I sipped the coffee, tears fell from my face. For so many reasons, it this place is my only option.

Faith is freeing when it is not dependent on me. With floating steps I can walk there. Every day I start burdened trying to lead a team and change their complaints to positivity. I feel the pressure of trying to make every day a memorable experience that will make them say It was worth it after 51 days in a place where we are asked to walk through the conversations with people who don’t know the speech sounds a, and, and the have meaning. But in that coffeeshop I sit on the mats on the floor, bruising my tailbone further, feeling my legs prickle as my circulation becomes more limited, and I change. Over truth, Burden and Pressure and Weight become Light and Free and I float like the butterflies at 6am.

And even though it sounds cheesy, it is true, love is the common denominator and the truth that changes people from the inside out. And evil and hatred and shootings and shame exists in any pocket of this planet but love is deeper still. I’ve seen it change a calloused soul. One carrying the guilt of death. One so scared of her own thoughts and words. One who is so determined to make up for herself that she was too tired to live. Little by little, she is still changing.

But the faith in someone else who lived for her brought her to rest. To joy. To Chiang Mai to tell friends about love that changes people and never ends, like an infinite fountain that sends waves to crash down on the earth. Though I can’t always see it, sometimes blinded by the wave itself, the fountain changes color from red like scarlet to white as snow. It’s changed me from red like scarlet to white as snow.

I just wanted to take a break from all the news of this week and this year so far, and provide you with one of the finer passages from Wikipedia - the Marathon subsection on the page for the 1904 Summer Olympics:

The marathon was the most bizarre event of the Games. It was run in brutally hot weather, over dusty roads, with horses and automobiles clearing the way and creating dust clouds. The first to arrive at the finish line was Frederick Lorz, who actually rode the rest of the way in a car to retrieve his clothes, after dropping out after nine miles. The car broke down at the 19th mile, so he re-entered the race and jogged back to the finish line. When the officials thought he had won the race, Lorz played along with his practical joke until he was found out shortly after the medal ceremony and was banned for a year by the AAU for this stunt, later winning the 1905 Boston Marathon.

Thomas Hicks (a Briton running for the United States) was the first to cross the finish-line legally, after having received several doses of strychnine sulfate (a common rat poison, which stimulates the nervous system in small doses) mixed with brandy from his trainers. He was supported by his trainers when he crossed the finish, but is still considered the winner. Hicks had to be carried off the track, and possibly would have died in the stadium, had he not been treated by several doctors. A Cuban postman named Felix Carbajal joined the marathon, arriving at the last minute. He had to run in street clothes that he cut around the legs to make them look like shorts. He stopped off in an orchard en route to have a snack on some apples which turned out to be rotten. The rotten apples caused him to have to lie down and take a nap. Despite falling ill from the apples, he finished in fourth place.

The marathon included the first two black Africans to compete in the Olympics: two Tswana tribesmen named Len Tau (real name: Len Taunyane) and Yamasani (real name: Jan Mashiani). They were not in St. Louis to compete in the Olympics, however; they were actually part of the sideshow. They had been brought over by the exposition as part of the Boer War exhibit (both were really students from Orange Free State in South Africa, but this fact was not made known to the public). Len Tau finished ninth and Yamasani came in twelfth. This was a disappointment, as many observers were sure Len Tau could have done better if he had not been chased nearly a mile off course by aggressive dogs.

Take care,

June 2016,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/06/22/how-to-go-back/,"June 2016, 22",How to go back,"Not long ago, I saw the Milky Way for the first time. 

I was nowhere near a pristine lake in Montana, nor the windswept steppes of Patagonia, nor any of the vast, breathtaking landscapes I imagined would - and should - accompany that existentially perfect moment, both humbling and empowering, where one finds their place among the stars. 

What was it that I imagined for myself, and why? In this fantasy I am probably someplace far way, literally and figuratively, from the grubby hands of civilization. Where sky and water and damp earth are untouched, where the light pollution that makes life so hard for astronomers and migrating butterflies and those who just want a good night's sleep, hadn't yet infiltrated. This is where you're closest to the universe as it really is, right? Where you can see, crystal clear, the giant celestial bodies from whence you came, stardust to dirt to life. We are all stardust, as Carl Sagan said.

And these are the places we come from: giant fireballs, hot, violent, explosive, spewing gas into the dark abyss. With no small amount of effort, their building blocks have collided and rearranged over millions of years to form drooling golden retrievers and stumbling chubby-cheeked toddlers and 29-year-old men who march into nightclubs and start shooting. We are all stardust. How does that make you feel?

If there is any place to feel the full weight and complexity of creation, I suspect that it is not in a place of purity, filled with all that is good and just and beautiful. We are obsessed with these places, our mythologies rich with eternal gardens and heaven and untouched forest. In its various manifestations there is an obsession with the idea of return, of going back to something purer - back to the land, back to God, back to simpler times, or, in its worst iteration, back to an imagined golden age that compels abusive policies to ""make America great again."" 

But what does it really mean to go back? If you believe, as I do, that there is something transcendent in the human soul that connects us to a place of moral integrity and purity, how do we collectively find and return to that place? How do we find our way back to the stars?

As experience reveals, it is not by prayer, nor by escape. Not by simply wanting it so. In organic chemistry lab we learned how to purify compounds. There are many techniques, and most of the time they have to be used in combination. Distillation, recrystallization, precipitation, etc., etc. It is tedious and sometimes excruciatingly boring. It requires an enormous amount of preparation and documentation. The process is filled with error and you may have to re-do things multiple times before you get it right. And even then, it will never be perfect, but with enough hard work it might just be good enough. 

Here are some of the impurities I want out of our world today: racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, xenophobia, loose and poorly enforced gun regulations, corruption in government, irresponsible investment on Wall Street, astronomical income gaps between our richest and poorest, disastrous drug and criminal justice policies. If we want to marvel at the stars in good conscience, it seems imperative that we have to put in the work. As our recently fallen champion Muhammad Ali told us, ""Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth.""

By the way, it was in a packed planetarium, neck craned up, uncomfortably sandwiched between strangers, that I first came face to face with the splendor of the Milky Way. The planetarium had recently installed new state-of-the-art projectors, and used them to throw bright satellite and telescope images of the night sky onto the giant dome above. It was not a perfect experience. But lots of people put in a lot of hard work to make it happen, and it was more than good enough. 

For those gunned down in Orlando and every victim of violence on this planet, I hope you rest in power.

But when I ask myself “What do I want to offer to all these people?” things get simpler.  My dream would be to find that still quiet place inside of me that is certain of Love, and then to look each of you in the eye and say, with an absolute and compelling and heartwarming authority: “You matter - right now, with all your perfect imperfections – and you are worthy of love and belonging.”

June 2016,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/06/19/music-is-the-jam-of-life/,"June 2016, 19",Music is the jam of life,"My name is Tom, and I'm a fairly cynical guy. Friends and family always call me a grumpy guy, down in the dumps, whatever. I brush it off and frown on into the sunset. But that's fine. Because even beneath it all, I think there's one thing keeping us all spinning on this ball of water, people and green - music.

I'm a student of history (and most things) and I think music keeps us all guessing, angling at what's next. That's probably the reason why we haven't blown ourselves up yet. We love a good story. What happens next? What's at the end of the rainbow? We'll keep running toward it, pushing away obstacles and jumping over challenges until we find out. No one wants to be the guy who writes ""The End"" when we're having such an interesting time.

But music is the way we decorate time and space - art decorates just space, TV and movies and books decorate just time. It's an invisible force that vitalises us - much like air - and brings us closer together. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Europeans invented waltz music to break down the barriers between dancers. Instead of dancing side by side, they could now dance in front of each other. Music may have precipitated the novel idea that love and marriage is for other reasons than money and prestige. Of course, this is just my theory. Well, Shakespeare might back me up.

Though we're not a ritualistic society. Well, not really. Even so, our rites of passage are marked with music. Christenings, graduations, weddings, you name it - there's songs to commemorate them, across every culture. Music is everywhere. After the shocking tragedy in Orlando the other day, people came together to grieve...and sing. It's a release like no other. We cannot change the past but we can make it that little bit better with music.

People gather together to see art and watch films, but they aren't sharing the experience like music. We sit on seats divided by armrests or clump together and walk on to the next painting. I have yet to talk to someone who made a lifelong friend watching a film or proceeding past a bunch of paintings. I can recall sitting on a bench at high school, earbuds lodged way too far in when a fellow traveller walked past and asked what I was listening to. I told him it was Slipknot (don't judge - I was 13 at the time...I still love heavy metal though) and I offered him an earbud. (Imagine doing that now!) 

He plucked it in, nodded away for a while and we got talking. We talked about other bands that were hot at the time (Blink 182! The Offspring!) and we've been friends ever since. Music is the neverending story. I think it keeps us grounded, and hanging on to this sometimes awful, sometimes beautiful place we call home.

So what do you think? I'd love to gain a few music loving friends through this, maybe some pen friends (keyboard friends?) I love writing - I'm a copywriter and journalist by trade - so the more correspondence the better!

It's been a big year for me. I've moved way out of my comfort zone with both my job and current location, and as a young person have learned a lot about myself in the process. Most importantly? Having the mindset to just go for it. I realized for far too long I wasn't taking much initiative when it came to seeking out what I wanted. So, I made a change and just decided to do a simple thing--ask. It got me my job, helped me make new friends in a new place, and overall has been the best thing I've ever done. Sure you get shot down sometimes, but at least you won't be tossing and turning at night asking yourself ""what if"". It's the reason why I decided to go for it and move to London this coming fall, too.

Secondly, my father had a heart attack recently (and survived GO POPS!). It was a very sobering moment for me to realize that my parents won't be around forever. So, for all of you out there who still have your parents--make sure to let them know you love them. 

Third, here's a list of my latests:

Book: Dune by Frank Herbert. In the meat of it right now so don't spoil it for me.Album: Ma Fleur by The Cinematic Orchestra. According to Spotify I'm at 124 play throughs so needless to say, give it a listen!Food: Coconut chicken curry. Hot damn.

Parting note: Write a letter to someone you care about. I wrote a letter every day in the month of March to someone who is important in my life, and it was an incredible experience. It made me sit down and reflect on my friendships, and it also made every single person's day I wrote to when they received it (because who writes letters anymore?)

Stay awesome out there and make sure to give me a shout if you're in CB or London!

Sometimes I don’t see anyone until I get to the 6th floor, sometimes I see friends and co-workers. Wish them well, have a good sleep (night or day is irrelevant with shift work), and wish them a safe shift.

I get to my locker, grab my headset, find a chair (not too big, not too small… a shiny one, it’s cooler for the 12 hours I’ll be sitting in it), and figure out the desk at which I’ll be sitting. I drag my chair over, get the rundown of the day from my co-worker, and wish them well. Sometimes, it has been a slow day, sometimes they’ve just taken a call that will stick with them forever… but it’s always the same, “Have a good sleep.”

I sit down, the emergency line rings, I answer. It’s a person complaining about their neighbour’s dog… it’s been barking all night. I try to explain that unfortunately this isn’t a life or death emergency or crime in progress and I will have to transfer them… They are very angry at me. They call me names, cruel names. I transfer them, and laugh… what can you do? All is silent for a few moments, the emergency line rings again. It’s a young mother. She is cowering in the bathroom with her children. Her husband just got home and is angry. The reason never matters. He is screaming and trying to break down the door. Her children are crying. She is crying. I am crying on the inside but on the outside I am calm, I am getting her address, confirming whether or not her husband has a weapon, and whether or not anyone else is in the house that didn’t make it to the bathroom before he went ballistic. I am trying to keep this woman’s attention, to answer my questions while she cries “Please, just get them here.” I sigh with relief as I hear the voices of the officers on the other end of the line, silently wishing them Godspeed. I disconnect the call. Silence… ring. “A man just walked in front of a train.”

My friends, my co-workers. These are the only people who truly understand. These are the people whom I have sworn to return safely to their families at the end of my 12 hours. These people are my responsibility. Every single time I send them to a call, I am forced to think about the worst case scenario. The officer with whom I just joked, who just brought us coffee, might not come back from the next call to which I send him/her. I weep when I see the news, another officer killed. Firefighters shot at responding to a call. I know the hurt that will seep through the lives of those close to them. I weep for the dispatcher who sent that person to that call. I know that they will blame themselves. And I know that brave soul may not survive the blame.

I became a dispatcher to make a difference. I drive home at the end of my shift and call my mom. She doesn’t ask specifics. We talk about my nephew, my plans for days off. She knows, she worries. I get home, I make dinner, and take my dog out for a walk, hug my boyfriend. Tomorrow’s another day.

On your darkest day, you will never see us, but we are there.

We are the thin gold line.

                 My name is Alexis Rinck, I´m 20 years old and studying abroad in Santiago, Chile...and I did not know how to respond to what this woman had  told me. You can take all the spanish classes at your university but I swear, none of them will prepare you with the vocabulary to express remorse, compassion, or sorrow needed for a situation like that. Instead, I sat there and looked at her with a sad look on my face and sipped my tea, wondering if I had understood her correctly. But I knew I did. Since I´ve been here, I have only seen her cough more and more every day, talk about more and more aches and pains, get out of bed less, eat less, and smile less.

                Studying abroad is an incredible privilege, and I know for many of my classmates it had meant drinking a lot and partying. Frankly, I thought I would be doing more of that. But the closer I got to this woman, the more I looked forward to coming home early, walking into her kitchen, seeing her shoot me a huge smile  and ask if I want to drink tea with her and watch soap operas. Which really begs the question, why? I´m 20 and in a foreign country but I´m spending significant amounts of time with someone four times my age who barely speaks.

                 When I was 16, I was ready for it all to be over. After childhood sexual abuse, verbal and physical abuse, a sexual assault in high school, and abusive relationships, I felt as if I couldn´t take it anymore. Self harming by 8, cutting by 15, suicidal by 16. Me, the honors student, band geek, teacher´s pet, wrote suicide notes in class and spent time trying to figure what would be the best way to off myself. It took me losing one of my closest friends to suicide a week after my own failed (clearly) suicide attempt to want to change my life.

                A quick note for those of you out there who feel alone, depressed, suicidal, I just want to tell you it gets so much better. I know if I was told that back in the day I would have punched that person. But, I got out of that small town, went to college, found my passion, and I´m currently finding myself.

But that´s not the point of this message. I am a constant work in progress and by no means an inspiration. There are days I falter, fall back into that depression, and want to fall off a cliff.

However, this woman, this elderly Chilean woman somehow represents three things to me.

1. She makes me appreciate life and reminds me to get out an enjoy my youth while I can. Because of her hands, she can no longer sew. Sewing was her passion and hobby. She can´t leave the house on her own and hardly does. Instead she sits inside all day, smokes cigarettes and watches TV. When I look at her, I can´t help but wonder if that will be me someday.

2. She reminds me how those we love can leave at any moment. I drink tea with her everyday as if it is our last.

3. She represents to me the beauty of a full life. Her living room is filled with pictures of children, grandchildren, old pets and old friends. This woman lived through the Chilean dictatorship and lived to see freedom. She has lived such a fulfilled and beautiful life that she does not fear her death and has accepted it. In that sense, I hope someday to be like her.

I'm still figuring it out, I think we all are. So figure it out with me:

His first book was published in 1960, when he was 33. He has been a ""serious"" poet, and poetry is not my thing.

Galway has a special place in my heart.

I wrote a paper on him in 10th grade, pick a poet, write a paper, he was my poet. Although researching his life didn't make me love poetry, I loved his poetry.

I am drawn to his work because it deals with social issues, but it is by no means confined to one subject. There’s also optimism and beauty in his language, especially the large role animals and children have in his later work.

If you are a fan of poetry you may already know about him, if you are not a poetry fanatic but are looking for some summer reading, I recommend reading some of his work. Lots of his work is online but my two favorites are:

Fergus FallingOatmeal (if you need more motivation- I'll name drop here, Bill Murray, likes this poem and has referenced it in interviews).

Started drawing when I was little. This thrilled my mom- she was an artist too, but she gave up on it. I haven't quite yet.

But I do procrastinate badly. I don't draw or animate nearly enough. Why don't we do the things we love? Or that are good for us? E.g., everyone should meditate.

One of my first days living in NYC, I stumbled out sleepily into the afternoon, planning only to get some juice, and found the park encircled with white billboard vinyl, divided up for artists.

I wanted to be a part of this so bad! Found the registration table and asked if there were free slots- yes, but I needed to have my supplies with me.

""Where's the nearest hardware store?""

I was back soon and fell in love with painting big.

Few years later, I was considering leaving NYC- can be harsh here for a gentle Southerner like myself. But Living Gallery said yes to a Fluidtoons mural. More than one, actually. I decided to stay. I still miss Atlanta though.

When I draw, my emotions spill out onto the page. Yum, delicious flow state.

What makes us happy besides flow?

Research says that we have a genetic setpoint of happiness that we tend to return to, even if we win the lottery or become paraplegic. But we can work at it. Tal Ben-Shahar's Harvard lectures explain better than me.

Check this out, though:

George Vaillant, director of a 72-year study of the lives of 268 men, said: “That the only thing that really matters in life are your relationships to other people.”

Whoa, right?

I'm lucky to have a talented girlfriend. ""Chandra Free"". Hire her.

I wish I were better at staying in touch with friends, though. And that I'd relaxed and gotten closer to my co-workers.

There's too much I want to write about here. Running out of words. And time. I'm just going to start listing things that are important to me:

- The gifted program (ARC in Tallahassee) changed my life. Mr. Berkeley introduced us to HTML (pico!) and Linux.

- One reason I moved to NYC is the animation scene here, and because of that, I met John Dilworth. So glad my out-of-control beard (gone now) didn't scare him off because our friendship's meant a lot to me. Dilworth encourages me to keep drawing. He's working on a pretty amazing new animated short, coming soon to a festival near you.

- I loved Dr. Frank Johnson's class at FSU. He teaches about brains and is marvelous at it.

- Dr. Ted Baker let me take his computer science courses when I was still in high school. That meant a lot. I was way into W. Richard Stevens' books back then.

- Universal Basic Income

- Mental health

- Dating's learn-able! Don't think it's entirely hopeless.

- Funding for the arts. Philip Glass drove a taxi and worked as a plumber. Heard it's easier being an artist in other countries. Why do we have to do so many things we don't want to? Breaks my heart to see my artist friends struggle so.

- My dear friend Alex is my first Patreon patron

- WFMU, WVFS

- Savor time with your pet. Sadly, they don't live forever.

Out of words. Would love to hear from you.

You, lingering caged beneath my skin like the warmth that follows the  sun.

But now, I feel you more in what I don’t. Absence radiating presence.

Everything is more here now that you aren’t.  Some nights the radiator buzzes so loud it shakes the bed. Some it’s the silence of being alone that’s deafening. I sing to forget the absence of everything but me. I listen to my heart beating or the second hand ticking, each forcing their way through something just to begin again from nothing.

I used to listen to you breathe as I fell asleep.  Each exhale; another sheep over the fence.  I never got past 17.

Now, the sheets are colder and my side of the bed seems to sag to the floor.

As far back as I can remember, I’ve been a restless sleeper. How many nights did my tossing leave you sheetless? How many nights did I wake to your tug and my unraveling?

Three days after you passed I fell asleep and woke-up for the first time.

This was the first thing I missed – the coming undone.

Awaking, a mixture of guilt and habit rolled me and all of your sheets back out. It didn’t feel right without you there to take them back. Suddenly, the not pulling felt harder than you had ever pulled.

The next few nights I made sure to tuck the sheets on your side in as firmly as I could.  It felt good to have something pull back.

The dimming reflections of you would slow their fading with something there to play your part. It helped me remember to forget. The sinking feeling took a little longer and gave a few more breaths before the gasping.

But despite my feeble attempts to recreate you, the covers would eventually come loose, pulling free from the mouth of our bed.

I tried staples, then tape. I tried anchoring our sheets beneath the feet of the bed. The stronger the grip; the more violent the awakening, pulling hand over fist just to feel you.  But each night, your grip slowly loosened and eventually there was nothing. I would think of myself.

Soon I was spending more time claiming your sheets than sleeping.  The more I claimed, the more your sheets reminded me of you, and the more all of it reminded me of me.

Then, one evening I gave up.

I don’t know why but I took off my clothes and lay naked in the middle of the bed, our bed.

My body, one half less yours, one half more mine than I’d ever wanted. I felt half as light and twice as heavy.

The skin around my nipples cinched tight and bubbled.  I felt your warmth in that cold for the first time.

I pretended my breaths were yours and didn’t get past 17.

In time your absence became your presence. The cold of our mattress was your warmth.  The nothing sheets, not in my hands, not wrapped tightly around my shapw became the opposite.

My inhales were your exhales.  Breath in.  Breath out.  One sheep, two.  The negative of your life lived with me.

Sleep crept between us, so I fought it until it finally went away.  Never asleep, never awake.  Just counting your breaths, that were mine, that were sheep. Day in. Day out.  I’m naked, cold and counting.  But I’m no longer alone. I feel you in what I no longer feel.

As Aziz Ansari quips, gone are things like the phone call when questions like “Want to hang out sometime?” demand an immediate response.

Instead, texting buys time and the anxiety of waiting for the ellipsis to end is what keeps us hanging on.  Maybe this will be the clever, romantic one liner we’ve been waiting for-the one where they show that they care.

Except it isn’t.  So your response back isn't.  But that’s ok, it’s too soon.  No hard feelings.

And just after you’ve told them about your family, your siblings, the chic coffee shop on your street corner, your career goals, and the first three digits of your social security number, they’re gone as quick as they came.

“Sure dad.”

During his last remaining months alive, my father had developed an affinity for some odd combinations of food.

Most of his meals were now being taken in bed and he was looking frail but not hopeless. Since he was diagnosed with the cancer a year or so prior, he had maintained that the Lord would heal him.

***

My father was a very honorable man. Classy is the word that comes to mind. He drove bus for half of my growing up years, and I knew he had to deal with a lot of difficult people. Yet he never really complained. This was typical of his generation.

Some of my favorite memories of him included playing golf together, throwing the baseball around and seeing him wake up early to read his devotions before heading off to work.

Sometimes I think God is most pleased with the folks who humbly make their way in the world with an unworldly peace in their heart trusting He’s going to take care of them. This was my father.

***

My mother, older brother and his wife were his constant companions while I drove back and forth from college when I could – mostly on weekends. We would talk, read scripture together and sometimes, sing.

Almost 20 years ago, on the morning of April 5th, he told my mom that Jesus was going to take him home that day.

And, around 7 in the evening, my dad’s cancer was healed.

 “When we drop fear, we can draw nearer to people, we can draw nearer to the earth, we can draw nearer to all the heavenly creatures that surround us.”  -bell hooks

As an animal cruelty caseworker I see some tough stuff and was happy to take a few days off to get “her” down to warmer weather before winter hit the Pacific Northwest. She gave me enough gruff getting out of town that I thought twice about the 1,100 mile journey ahead, but I kept going.

I purchased “her,” a 1978 Westfalia five years ago, the gender and name assigned circa 1978. Comfortable high speed is 55mph on flat highways which surprisingly is very civilized, but a good chunk of that drive is through mountain passes; needless to say I gratefully saw parts of the states previously blurred.

Long distance road trips are warmly familiar. As immigrants from England, my family was amazed by the size of the US and we drove from coast to coast, excited to see all that lay in-between. I have stickers, patches, rocks and other mementos carefully picked by my 7 year-old brain. These memories are romanticized a tad as I know I shaved my legs half way through New Mexico because my sister pulled my leg hair when we fought and my Mum pulled off the April fool's joke I'll never live down. Apparently backwards clothes day isn't a real thing here (yes, there are pictures).

Back to this trip though, I stopped frequently to top up, had a mechanical issue that took a few days to fix, and it took a lot longer to get anywhere. At times I felt anxious, but told myself there's no rush and to embrace all of it. As a lot of you know, there's magic in travel, and for me, that old bus is a much needed reminder to enjoy the little things and keep it simple. Each journey brings people together (nostalgia; story telling), provides a place to listen/talk, observe, feel and learn. It gifts both time for reflection and ""to just be."" Suddenly the world feels kind again.

I made it down to sunny pastures 6 days later with new friends and memories, content and planning the next leg for the summer. The unknown is exciting. Making new friends/reconnecting is fun. Compassion is limitless. If you fancy joining for part of the journey or grabbing a coffee, please email me, tell me about yourself and I'll let you know if I'm in your area!

Authenticity. Within the beautiful mess of our globalized world we are unavoidably surrounded by an immeasurable number of vastly intertwined cultures of near and far, past and present, fusions and appropriations. In it ‘authenticity’ is being used all around us (in Wester rhetoric at least), and I am endlessly baffled by how differently we all understand this singe word, how its influences cultural production, audience perception, and the way we navigate within society. So I focused my research on it.

Take a painter for example. Consider, how you may label him/her authentic, based on their ability to convey honesty and truthfulness, through creating uniqueness by their power of creativity. Consider then again a dish prepared exactly as it was by your great-grandmother, the list of ingredients passed down through the generations, an authentic meal, as far as it is true to its original, right? Or the performance of a traditional folk song accompanied by musicians on instruments of the time – is that not authentic?

But what happens if the painter uses stencils, prints, mechanical modes of reproduction? When work of art is used to create another? What if you serve your great-grandmothers recipe with a side dish traditional to a culture half was across the world, a dish she could not have known about, let alone serving it with, does that ruin the authenticity of your meal? What if the folk song is performed in jeans and t-shirts?

Can authenticity mean creativity and being true to an original at the same time? Does your interpretation of authenticity influence how you view art? How you understand culture? How you interpret and judge other people?

The fact is, that there are many definitions, many approaches, but no precise measurements for any of them. Next time, however, when you hear “wow, this is so authentic”, consider the cultural context of the subject of praise, consider its origin, the myriad ways in which it can exist, what it may mean to people of different cultures and backgrounds, from different times. Perhaps it will open you up towards new interpretations of the cultures, the people, the behaviors around you.

Want to dive into some definitions and concepts? Google “authenticity” in combination with any of the following:  Eminem, hip hop, heritage, tourism, objective, first/second/third person. Enjoy!

As my body works. I’m beginning a project which involves a long time fascination of mine: thinking about how our day-to-day activities influence how our bodies develop, feel and look. Scars, visual reminders etched in skin mapping out the lives we’ve led; our muscles adapting to new constraints we put them under, pain us and allow us to develop new layers of muscle memory, perform tasks of all scale with growing perfection. I invite you to consider how your jobs and responsibilities have left temporary and permanent marks on your body. If you’d like to participate in the project write to me about how you find your own body has changed from the works you do or did, and attach a picture to illustrate.

Thanks Chad for filling my first two month in #823 with good food and great conversations! Enjoy the new place (hi Mark & Ben)! Nate & Felix, it’s been years since you introduced me to the listserve, I hope you’re still reading, because I’ve been wanting to send you this virtual hug through the inboxes of 22429 strangers ever since!

June 2016,07,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/06/07/free-concert-at-altamont-a-request-re-keith-richards/,"June 2016, 07",Free Concert at Altamont (+ a request re: Keith Richards),"Some say history is written by the victors, but I'm not so sure about that.  Most of the time it's pretty fuzzy who the victors are...

This I know:  history is often written --sometimes gouged in stone-- by those seeking to keep the status quo intact.

Have you heard about the Free Concert at Altamont?

I'll tell you, since I'm producing 2 documentaries on Altamont.

But first I'll ask---knowing it's a long shot----do you know Keith Richards, guitarist of the Rolling Stones?  if so, could you possibly connect us up?

Even 5- to 10-minute interview will work!  It's for those Altamont documentaries I started telling you about...

Q: What's Altamont?A: There's the conventional narrative, vs. the more interesting narrative.

Conventional:

""Four months after the peaceful Woodstock Festival, San Francisco psychedelic bands and the Rolling Stones gather--a carelessly planned event at a decrepit demolition derby racetrack, godforsaken part of California, bitter cold winter, Hells Angels 'Security' stab a black teenager to death, while the Rolling Stones play.""

The more interesting history is a mosaic of stories--creating a far more complex, far different picture of Altamont.

Mainstream narratives assert that violence at Altamont marked the death of idealism--the end of countercultures.  An oft-repeated tale of comeuppance--to those daring to believe in or live by rules of love, human connectedness, spontaneity, expressiveness, caring for each other, goodness, openness, compassion, personal freedom.

Thing is: these ideals didn't come to the fore exclusively during the 1960s.  They always come to the fore, over time immemorial--and they're always a direct challenge to hierarchical, materialistic, individual-as-king, linear dictums of ""reality” that line up as soldiers buttressing the status quo.

These ideals didn't die at Altamont....and were vibrantly alive the night before.

Documentaries:

        (1) ""The Night Before Altamont"" (radio)

        (2) Altamont 360° (film + interactive transmedia components)

Why?

(1)  Conventional narratives about Altamont suck. Aside from Gimme Shelter (1969 film--see it!), they're marked by blame, shame, cynicism, ideological hatred, recrimination, and sensationalism.

In other words, history by self-proclaimed ""victors"" seeking to ridicule and squash humanistic ideals as silly and ""congenitally naive.""

My documentaries--inspired by Kurosawa's Rashomon---radically reframe Altamont by presenting multiple simultaneous perspectives, underscoring that ""alternative"" narratives are as real and true--if not more so--than those making it ""through"" to claim One Real Truth.

(2) When people die, their stories die too--unless collected.

I've interviewed 2 dozen and met dozens more Altamont denizens----Director Albert Maysles, free-spirits who hitchhiked as teenagers to Altamont, current and former Hells Angels (both men of integrity, very kind to me), Grateful Dead and Rolling Stones management, Black Panthers, many more.

- Some died---never to see the finished product (heartbreaking)- Those alive must be interviewed to tell their truths!

Keith Richards?

Just 12 hours before the concert, Altamont radiated positive cooperative energy--hundreds of Bay Area volunteers creating concert infrastructure, thousands of kids camping​, ​joyfully anticipating the next day's events.

Atmosphere so cool Keith Richards spent the night there, alone!

""I went the night before, and I stayed. It was really beautiful...everywhere I went was a gas. People were sitting around campfires...getting high...it was really cool..."" (Rolling Stone magazine, 1971)

This story has not been adequately told---and new mythos emerge claiming the night before was also dark and violent.

I need Keith's voice to round out the radio documentary.

Just a few words from Keith will incentivize public radio to air ""The Night Before Altamont.""

Once aired, ""The Night Before Altamont"" will stand alone--plus serve as ""demo reel"" for film, Altamont 360°

Help me get even 5 minutes of Keith ""tape"" to finish these projects---reframing which victors ""​write"" ​history​ ​​and ​tell our stories. Thanks!​!

What I have read has inspired me and has been a welcomed distraction from my toughest days.

There’s so much I want to write! Here’s some random tidbits about me:

Throughout my time as a Board Certified Music Therapist, I have worked primarily with children and adults with special needs on learning musical instruments. I have taught music theory, guitar, piano, trumpet, saxophone, and recorder in MANY different ways. I have taught music with color or lettered notation, created silly sentences to fit into beats, created hundreds of visual aides, etc. all with one goal: to make each client I work with feel successful.

I live by the idea that every single person on this planet interprets the world around them differently.

I randomly picked up an audiobook a few months back from the library. It was my first one, and I was unsure of how well I would be able to follow an entire book while driving. I’m in my car a lot for work, so I figured it was worth a try. I have always loved to read, but I typically have problems with reading comprehension. I was amazed with how well I was able to retain the contents of the audiobooks. They have rejuvenated my passion for reading and (almost) make driving in New Jersey tolerable. I’m now on my 18th audiobook and I’d love some recommendations!

I love my two children more than anything in the world, but I have come to the conclusion that it is okay to sometimes wonder why I willingly decided to have tiny freeloaders living with me.

I’m starting graduate school in the fall. I still can’t determine whether this is an amazing or absolutely insane idea. If any of you have gone back to school as a parent, I’d really like to know your secrets to success!

I love really horrible movies. One of my recent favorites has been “Chopping Mall.”

My favorite movie of all time is “Xanadu.” Olivia Newton John, ELO, AND Gene Kelly? You can’t go wrong!

I have a black lab/hound dog named Rainbow. We adopted him when I was feeling the call of mother nature to have a third child. He acts like a toddler and is just absolutely perfect as a family dog.

My favorite quote is from the novel “Cat’s Cradle” by Kurt Vonnegut. He wrote: “peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.” While I’m unsure of how I feel about God, I find peace through exploration and going on long drives. I typically don’t plan out my vacations beyond where I’d like to go. I love getting comfortably lost in new areas.

I love to talk to new people! Please email me if you want to know more about music therapy, or if any of the random things that I’ve written about are things you are also passionate about.

Thanks for reading!

June 2016,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/06/05/pineapples-penguins/,"June 2016, 05",Pineapples & Penguins,"Hello beautiful people of the world! I'm super stoked to be writing to you all, but am at a loss of what to actually say. I've been a part of The Listserve since its humble beginnings and I have truly enjoyed reading everyone's thoughtful emails. As a newly minted 25 year old, I don't have any major life lessons or thoughtful stories to share so instead a couple of ramblings....

THINGS I LOVE: Broadway. I'm not exactly sure how it started, but it has grown over time (my Bat Mitzvah party was themed ""Ilana on Broadway). I am a huge theater nerd. I don't perform myself, but am an avid theatergoer and hope to produce a Broadway show one day. (Any tips to start now in my free time?) Theater is certainly getting its revival with the popularity of Hamilton. For everyone wondering, yes it is as good as everyone says. It's groundbreaking and different. I am curious to see the long term impact it has. It seems to be the RENT of this decade less the taboo subject manner.  But just because you can't get Hamilton tickets, doesn't mean you shouldn't go see a show. There are plenty of fantastic shows each year, incredibly talented actors, directors, composers, etc. To me, the greatest test of an actor's ability is his/her ability to perform 8 shows a week and make it new and interesting each time. When an actor is on TV or in a movie, they can do take after take to get it right. Theater is live, there's no starting over. So, if you are in NYC, or Toronto, London, Chicago, La Jolla, go see a show! I have a million suggestions so feel free to email me for some ;).

MY DREAM: Law and Order: SVU is my favorite show ever (my dog is named Elliot Stabler -- you can follow him on Instagram @Smelliot_NYC) and my dream is to be a dead body on the show -- let me know if you got the hook up for extras.

MY SIBS: I think it's very sad and strange when people aren't close with their siblings. I have two brothers and they are two of my best friends. I can't imagine not having a close relationship with either of them.

So with that, a small plug: My younger brother is interning in DC this summer in Healthcare consulting. He is going to be a senior at the University of Michigan this fall and wants to go into public health. Any tips, job leads, etc let me know.

My older brother is a mad-talented cinematographer. You can check out his latest work in the spec film 'HALA THE FILM.'

ON THE SUBJECT LINE: I'm wearing a pineapple shirt and I got to hang out with penguins today at the Detroit Zoo.

A FUNNY STORY: As a small child, I once was sat on while going to the bathroom. A woman backed into the stall, didn't see me, pulled down her pants, and sat on me. No, I did not get peed on.

Peace.love.hobbits.

Not So Fast!,"Isn’t it amazing how subjective hiring and jobs reports are? If you’re working, that’s great! If you’re out of work or in-between gigs, however, those numbers seem abstract and like someone else’s jackpot.

You must remember: you are not abstract, you are not a number, or an algorithm waiting to be detected. You will be working soon. As I always used to tell loved ones when I was job searching: ‘I can’t make them hire me.” Just keep the faith and be ready to go!

If you’re job hunting, it’s crucial to stay excited and engaged. I know this current job market doesn’t always make sense and chaos, seemingly, abounds. Political theater has gone mondo absurdo, attention spans are microscopic, and connectivity can seem to be a unicorn.

I’m 46 years old and - until I was 38 - the longest I’d ever been unemployed was 9 business days. Mind you, this was before I was specialized or firmly ensconced in my industry, which is media. In my 20s, it was nothing to go from temping for a CFO to working for a Mom and Pop financier (“My husband likes the light to hit his Wall Street Journal just so..…” one co-owner quietly hissed, opening the blinds at a precise tilt, but that’s a story for another day).

Yet, once I got specialized and words like ‘manager’ and ‘analyst’ came onto my resume, when layoffs and buyouts came down the pike hand-in-hand, I was unemployed for much longer than 9 days…try more than 9 months during the last recession.

I know the feeling of ‘everybody’ seeming to have a job while you’re on the bench, ready to be tagged in, thrown the proverbial ball. Networking wasn’t an option for me – jobs were scarce among my peers and I couldn’t afford endless prospecting lunches. Applying for less specialized titles backfired (crickets). When I applied for a job with the New York Times – on the 4th of July – on their website (all against conventional wisdom), that is the job I got 2 months later.

I’ve recently had to follow the above advice all over again and stay in faith and enthused. Don’t compare yourself to anyone else – in life or in your field. Don’t get carpal tunnel applying to every job board notice you see. Create job alerts via Indeed, Simply Hired, or any other credible job search engines. Make sure those alerts are set to a frequency of at least once-per-day in your inbox. Create 50 of them if you have to, you can filter or delete them later. Create Google alerts for whatever will help you in your search. A sampler of alert queries I used: job search engines, free tutorials, journalism, broadcasting, hiring, etc.

Stay active and current on LinkedIn. I can’t overstate how helpful that can be, just for your sanity while in search. Read and be aware of sources (online or print) that cover your industry. If you were called into an interview, what would your take on the current state of your industry be? You just need that one interview with an employer you can contribute to, an opportunity to engage.

In many ways it can seem we’ve taken the long way ‘round, but your career path is yours. Everyone gets their zenith, their time on the ride, so look forward to it. Unless you’re retired, it’s an ongoing challenge but it’s your path, your moment, and joy is there too. Rest, regroup, start again, take a walk (or nap!), start again.

 Good luck and I hope our paths cross one day! I’m rooting for you!

I never planned to be a musician. I studied creative writing and literature, and expected to become a teacher or a writer. Yet somehow in the last 13 years, I've released 10 albums and have played 1200+ shows in the US and abroad without the help of management or a record label (but backed by amazing fans).

In part, the decision to play music professionally was born not only out of my love for writing and performing songs, but also out of my love for travel and my desire to see new places and meet new people (oddly, or maybe not, it was all started via a study abroad program 16 years ago - thank you Santa Chiara). It's been an incredible way to make friends and do things I never expected I'd do. To finance tours, studio time, and record production, I've worked a *very* random assortment of jobs over the years (not to mention played hundreds of shows and driven hundreds of thousands of miles). I've learned to be patient and flexible. Thanks to my supportive fans, I'm grateful to say that I've been able to finance each album through pre-orders (long before such a thing as Kickstarter existed) and I've never been in debt in order to keep it going. My profit has been life experience, and the opportunity to continue making albums.

But shortly after I received the ""you've won!"" email, something else happened that gave me pause and reminded me of how grateful I am to just be alive and here with people I love.As I mentioned above, I'm in St Louis visiting family. On the first afternoon we were here, I was taking a nap when I heard sirens just outside. The siren stopped, and I started to fall back asleep. But then another one came, and another. I heard footsteps from the living room as everyone headed outside, so I finally got up to see what was going on.

The next door neighbor had suffered a massive heart attack. He called the paramedics himself, but they weren't able to save him. He was a respected actor in local theater, and his name was Barry. He was only 50 years old. An hour before, he was just mowing his lawn like millions of other guys on a sunny Saturday on Memorial Day weekend. He had just begun to clean out his basement when he had chest pains.

My sister lives in a small, quiet cul de sac, where most of the neighbors know each other at least by sight, and yet many of them only met each other in person for the first time that afternoon, standing on the street outside Barry's house while the paramedics worked inside. It was a sobering reminder of how brief all of this is, and how easy it is to forget to reach out to those around us. The obituary in the local paper closed with a friend of his saying, “But he was so loved. I hope he knew that. I just wish I had one more chance to tell him.”

Tell your dear ones that they are loved. Don't wait.

I find no sense of peace here. No solace from the world. Wind whistles outside of my window, echoing haunting notes throughout my room. Harsh words make their way into my restless mind. I know I should be able to block them out. I should be strong enough to appease the voice inside. Yet I can’t. The frightening side of me approaches, and a sense of dread fills me. Disturbing, intrusive thoughts that I try to erase from my mind creep inside.    Tap tap tap tap… Tap tap tap tap…. My pointer finger gently taps a four-beat pattern on my mattress. The temperature of the room seems to fluctuate, bouncing in between a sweltering summer afternoon and a crisp autumn night. A sense of hollowness begins to fill my body. I look down at myself. My eyes settle on the scars. Not any physical scars, but the scars that the whip of my words has left. I can see them as though they were tattooed on me.    There in my room, attempting to calm myself, I feel a strange sense of dissonance. A strong sense of being a foreign object in my own home settled on me. At the same time, there has never been a time where I feel more like myself. The four soft beats I tap on the bed resonate in my ears. They release the pressure in my head. They begin to silence the incessant verbal attack within me. I finally start to feel like myself.The wind has concluded its dark symphony, leaving a deafening silence in its wake. And as I lie there, a realization comes to me. Only at night can I finally remove the mask. Only after the curtains are drawn on the performance of my day can I finally drop the act of who I pretend to be. The facade is over. But it will begin again. I know that as my alarm beckons me to wake up, pulling me away from the freedom of finally being myself, the act will begin again._______________________________________    This is a short piece of creative writing I recently wrote.

There's a balance of sorts - most activities, performed with sufficient ineptitude and confidence, can indeed hurt you pretty badly - but it's easy enough to avoid serious injury on a day to day basis.

I kinda messed that one up a bit, made it all the way to 21 before I broke my neck diving into a three-foot-deep swimming pool.Somehow I escaped this largely without injury - besides the obvious broken neckbones.  I can walk, tilt my head around to *just barely less* than my former range of motion.

A lot of people could learn some kind of serious, profound life message from this.  I'm stuck with a Henry-Rollins-esque ""uh, don't do stupid shit"" for a moral.  I guess it's good advice.

About 30 of us stood lined up, shoulder to shoulder, all in khaki pants and worn, dirty white shirts tucked in.  We stared in silence, tired as it was already past11PM.

All of us were trying to join a certain organization, but had to go through a rigorous process to demonstrate our commitment to said organization.  Every week, we were assembled and scrutinized for hours.  Every time we made a mistake, we had to conduct a series of physical exercises.

""I said, did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is!?!""  The second time was louder.  In his perfectly sculpted attire, he looked crazy.

We stood silently, waiting for more exercises to be doled out as punishment.

""Get down.  Push-up position NOW!!!"" he shouted.

We clumsily shuffled into push-up position, hugging the ground.

""Begin!"" he yelled.

We began doing push-ups.  ""Sir, one sir!  Sir, two sir!  Sir, three sir...""

""Insanity is doing the exact same FUCKING thing over, and over again, and expecting shit to change.""  His voice leveled out.  ""That is crazy, isn't it?""

""Sir, fifteen sir!  Sir, sixteen sir...""

""The first time I learned what the actual definition is, I almost shat myself.""  He had a grin.  ""Come on, seriously?""

""Sir, twenty two sir!  Sir, twenty three sir...""  

We were getting tired and the fat guys began really struggling, their facial expressions reminding us that they were in a worse hell than us.  By this point, we usually were told to stop, try again, or do something else as if we were too physically exhausted, we were then truly useless.  

He kept going.

""But then, I look around, and I see that he's right.  Like all of you fucking pieces of shit come every week without knowing your shit. So, you guys then have to do a bunch of exercises.""

The original push-up cadence had all but disappeared.  We were struggling, and most of us could not even do a proper push-up anymore.  Being in a hot room full of smoke didn't help.

""And you guys can't even do a FUCKING push-up correctly!!!"" he yelled at one of the overweight guys clearly struggling.

""Every week, I say to myself 'This week is going to be different.'  'Maybe they'll show some progress and proof that they want to commit to this program.'""  He was calm now, but had this crazy posture that indicated he had left the reservation a long time ago.

I don't know how many reps we had done, but it didn't matter.

""BUT YOU BLOW IT EVERY WEEK!""

By now, we are usually up and trying again, but clearly, he was going on.

""Stop!  Assume forward leaning rest!""

Although we didn't have to do any push-ups (for now), forward leaning rest wasn't so much a ""rest"" as our arms were torched after what we had just put them through--it was basically a standing push-up position.  To put it simply, it also sucked.

""Relax, relax.  Everything is alright.  Let's chill.""  

We weren't sure if he was talking to us, or himself.  But we were all looking up, seeing what our fate for the next 15 min would be.

He looked up at us with a bad look.  

Silent pause.

""Did I ever tell you the definition of insanity?""

I hope this note finds you well. Currently I am in india. My journey to this country began on April 30th, 2016 when I traveled from Morocco to New Delhi to attend an interfaith exchange program with the Dalai Lama. I never thought i would meet him and in his compound in Dharmasala, i heard a lot about him, but meeting him has never crossed my mind. A very funny guy he was during our meeting. Well what to expect from someone considered to a Symbol of peace and compassion.What brought me to India has a relationship to what is happening in my small community in the southeast of Morocco and around the world as well, it is extremism and mainly the religious one.

People from 13 countries came to India to learn from the wisdom of the Dalai Lama, to learn about healing after traumas, to learn about love, compassion, and forgiveness. It is very hard to forgive someone who has hurt you or hurt someone you care for and love. After all, we are humans, we make mistakes, and the best people are those who learn from their mistakes.Forgiveness is something we all need to learn and practice in order to have inner peace. Because that is how global peace is achieved, starting with one's self.

My trip to india has taught me patience, compassion, and love. As  people living in this planet, we need to educate the next generation about peace, as good quality education is what will make us live in a peaceful world. As by then, people won't be extremists because peace will be a priority for them.

So my friends, Let us educate the next generation, let us build peaceful communities. I still remember the Dalai Lama's words, he said it is 2016 now, i may live for some extra years, max would be 2036. And I wont be here, but you will be here, and it is you who should finish the job, not someone else.

India, a great country to learn from its cultural and religious diversity, it is a must visit country.

For now, be safe and I look forward to reading your emails. Please feel free to email me back anytime.

Let us stay in touch,Your friend Mouad from Morocco.

I'd argue this guy wrote the hardest music that sounds like music (vs. annoying nonsense), though his music is an acquired taste.

Hello there!!! I'm a reclusive Armenian, I don't think I have any famous neighbors but who knows!? I've a hard time making friends, I guess knowing me is an acquired taste.

It's all downhill for me, my career that is. Literaly: I'm a computational scientist, specializing in numerical optimization. Basically, I instruct computers on how to find the lowest points of things: going downhill. I love this sort of thing because it brings the best of science together, and you can solve all kinds of crazy problems: planning routes through cities, designing basically anything, simulating the universe, creating 3D surfaces from pictures (my favorite!), financial planning, neural network building, detecting cancer with less radiation, list goes on.

Day job gets old though. I'm more excited that I'm moonshining as a machinist lately than about the constrained nonlinear multivariate functions I need to minimize for my day job. Studying electromagnetics when I can, because I never did, diffraction is crazy cool.

Have you ever looked inside a crevasse? No? Do it ASAP!!! Find a glacier near you, walk up it, locate a crack, look down (careful though, you could die!). They are so modest, considering that they're bottomless icy death traps. I literally walked over one last year wider than my body without realizing it till just across. I think mountains are the coolest things, not because they're big or because you feel like you conquered something if you make it to the top, but because they are so alien. That little earth-zit in the distance is SO different from anywhere else.

I didn't originally think I wanted kids, but my (unintended) three year old daughter is just the coolest thing I've ever had. I love her so much. The other week she said ""Hello my little Ben! I mean, hello my big fat man!"" and I just fell giggling on the floor. The awe in her face when I crack open a seed I find on a walk to see what color it is inside, priceless. Definitely recommend.

I think I'll stop with one though.

The rapist has taught me to take responsibility for my feelings, which the cowboy in me translates as ""think & talk with less bullshit"". I've become enamored with this idea and want to share via example: let's say you're talking to a friend and he makes another joke that's boring. Most would say:

""You're boring, dude.""

He'll probably laugh it off or bite back, but this contributes to bullshit in the world. What else wrong with this picture? You conveyed your opinion in a dismissive manner, and judged him. Consider instead:

""You bore me, dude.""

You took responsibility for what you experienced by comminucating what is, by definition, an indisputable fact. What you said was probably more effective than the other approach, with the benefit of being fully judjement-devoid.

This is my (lucky!) second time writing to everyone on The Listserve so I thought I'd share the spotlight a little. I'm a high school Art and Art History teacher and I asked students in a couple of my classes what they would like to say to the group.  A few students decided to share briefly what was on their mind at 7:45 in the morning but first a word or two about what I care about...

I have been teaching art for nearly 20 years and over the last 12 years I have cultivated an art studio class that gives as much (more, really) weight to the process of learning and making art than the physical act or end artifact itself. The class is mixed grades, and considered an elevated (honors) course. Mostly because the students are expected to be intrinsically motivated and we shouldn't be wasting time with behavioral stuff. More important for us to build a culture of rapport and support, to push each other to try new things, and to reflect on our process and what we have learned. In those years I have worked with amazing students who develop a point of view that they carry into the world through study, artmaking, social action and more. I am so amazed at their energy and what they do. And the magic for me is seeing them grow in front of me - become themselves - in our class.

So,  back to their thoughts:

We are all just things in a great big thing of things.

Help I'm trapped in the email company

god is godand i am notcontrol what you canlet go of what you cannot

be inimitable.

When asked what to talk about I always hit a wall.

pray for the things you want, work for the things you need

It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice.

I just shared exactly as they sent them to me, no editing. I think it typifies how they see themselves: trying out philosophy, thinking on their place in the world. What I wish I could show you are their artworks, the things they make when they stake a claim and pursue a concept artistically. Film, animation, stencil work, music video, graphic design, drawing and more. Every year I get my rosters and am met with enthusiasm, brightness, joy.

So here is a salutation to all the students past and present, all of you thinking about becoming students again, those of you that teach, or those of you with children that are students...celebrate the students and teachers that bring joy, creativity and enthusiasm; share yourself, strive for an awesome inclusive and idea driven community.

Make something every day!

So I feel I need to correct a misperception.  Just because it is cooked on a grill, it does not make it barbeque.

To cook something on an open flame over direct heat is to grill.  To barbeque is to cook something slowly over indirect heat, flavoring the food with smoke.  

What you are served at a barbeque differs depending on the region you are visiting.   In the south, it will be pulled pork.   In Texas, it will be beef brisket. There is also chicken (thighs are best), ribs and most anything you can think of.  But it is never hamburgers and hot dogs.  That is a cook-out, not a barbeque.

Sauce, which is optional, varies by region as well.  I am partial to Eastern Carolina style, which is vinegar based.   Western Carolina has a bit of tomato in it, but still a lot of vinegar.  South Carolina is mustard based.  Kansas City style is tomato based and sweeter.   Alabama even has a white barbeque sauce (mayo-based) that is great on chicken!

Now that the warmer weather is here (in the US), I hope everyone will be spending a lot more time outside and enjoying friends, family and barbeque, whatever style you enjoy.

May 2016,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/05/22/millennials-dont-actually-want-to-job-hop/,"May 2016, 22",Millennials Don't Actually Want to Job Hop,"Over the past couple of years, I keep reading articles that claim millennials have low company loyalty and that job hopping is quite normal.

For instance, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median employee tenure for workers aged 25-34 in 2014 was three years. Two years earlier, the median tenure was 3.2 years.

While I do agree, to some extent, that millennials today switch jobs at a faster rate than their predecessors, I disagree with the notion that they have low company loyalty or like switching jobs constantly. (I mean, who really wants to pack and deal with moving companies every year?)

In conversations with peers and through my own research, I believe that most millennials actually want job security and stability.

So, why do millennials tend to switch jobs at a faster rate?

Millennials want to work for a company where they truly ‘fit,’ and many millennials have trouble finding that perfect company until the third or fourth time and they don’t like to settle. By fit, I mean an employee’s values should match the values and the mission of the company they are working for.

Many millennials, for instance, deeply value learning and development from their employers and, at their first company, those millennials might not feel they are getting the types of developmental opportunities they need and seek a different opportunity.

Shouldn’t it be easy for millennials to find a company that matches their values?

There are a multitude of reasons why this occurs. Out of college, many millennials might not know exactly what type of company best suits their personality and it takes some time and professional experience to figure out. In addition, given the fluctuations of the economy sometimes you just have to take any job you can get.

How can employers find candidates that truly fit their values?

- Ask candidates where they see themselves in the future: Ask potential candidates where they see themselves in five or ten years. Based on the candidate’s response, assess if the company can help the candidate get to that place or not (Note: If the candidate gives a generic response, press for a more honest answer).

- Be honest about the company’s culture: During interviews, be honest about the company’s culture. Some companies have work-life balance, others don’t. Some companies are more collegiate, other’s aren’t. By communicating what the company is and is not, a candidate will have a better sense of the company and whether they will be a good fit or not.

- Be honest about the type of candidate you are trying to hire: During the interviews, communicate what type of candidate would be a great fit for the job at hand and the company. Furthermore, after you explain that to the candidate, ask them how they feel about that. By communicating the type of person you want to hire to the candidate, they (and you) will be able to assess whether or not the job would be a good fit for them.

This last dish was a regular at our family functions and the start of my love affair with baking.

My grandma died when I was in high school and I felt like I had lost my safety net. I processed my grief through flour and butter and mounds of tart green apples.

Time went on, I moved from Oregon to Torino, Italy. That first November away from my family and our holiday traditions was hard. I had the opportunity to bring Thanksgiving to Italy and cooked a traditional feast for a large group of friends. Planned dessert options included the standard pumpkin pie and of course, apple crisp. An edible telling of the story of family and love and connection to home.

I desperately emailed my mom,  “PLEASE MOM!!!!!” read the subject line, after my multiple attempts of trying to get her to send the recipe. “I did not mean for you to go into a panic, sorry.” Followed by the recipe, which I printed for safekeeping. I would make sure it would always be with me. It was 2001 and in less than a year, my life would be upended. The death of my mother, a move back to the US, and a path that looked so very different from what I had imagined.

She was 45 when she died from a rare cancer. Diagnosis to death was four months. Just long enough to realize that at 22 years old, I wasn’t ready for what it meant to go through adulthood without my mom. Every hurdle crossed, achievement made would be bittersweet. Blank space filled in with imaginary conversations about grad school, marriage, home ownership, becoming a mom, and moving back to Europe a second time.

Through a devastating mistake, all of her emails to me were deleted. That message my mom sent on November 19, 2001 is the last written communication I have from her.  - Fins because she loved Jimmy Buffett, 08 because 07 was taken, and AOL because of those sweet trial CDs we all got in the 90’s. The ink has faded, the folds made permanent, and even though the recipe has long since been memorized… it creates a sense of security and attachment every time I open its soft worn edges.

When I miss them most, I tie up my apron strings and pull out the familiar ingredients. Smells from the oven reminding me that wherever I am, they are too and only a dish away. I am keeping the tradition and their memories alive in my son. He even eats the apple peels just like I did all of those years ago.

Grandma Bum’s Apple Crisp

4 cups tart green apples, peeled and sliced1 tsp cinnamon1 tsp salt¼ cup water¾ cup flour1 cup granulated sugar⅓ cup unsalted butter

Preheat oven to 350F. Butter an 11x7” baking dish. Layer the apples evenly and sprinkle with cinnamon, salt, and water. Rub together flour, sugar, and butter until crumbly. Drop mixture over top of apples. Bake for approx. 40 minutes. Top should be golden brown. Serve with ice cream and eat leftovers for breakfast :-)

There were many years where he'd buy me new clothes for school because mine were old and I didn't want to be embarrassed by having clothes that were torn or had holes in them. He paid our rent so we wouldn't be evicted.  My grandfather always took care of my family's needs when my parents were unable. When I was a baby, he’d come home from work during lunch to play with me and he’d read me a new book every day. He tried to teach me how to play golf when I was 7, and I was no good. He had a lot of patience. When I was 12, he taught me how to build my first computer from scratch. He always stuck up for me: When I wanted to join the fire department, when I wanted to work in emergency management and when I decided to run for city council. He was proud of me. When he retired from the job he worked at for 30 years, he took my entire family to Disney World. At 72 years old, he'd accomplished a lot. He was married for 54 years to the same woman, and they had a pretty good relationship.  On March 23 of this year, he took my mother and I to see his parents. But really, we were escorting him to see him mom and dad in Florida for one last time. When I got to the airport with him, I found out he'd gotten us first class tickets. It was bittersweet: He had to use up all his airline miles before he died. And he knew he was going to die.  When the cancer spread to his brain, it took two weeks before he died. He didn't want to die in a nursing home, so I helped my grandmother keep him at home. The last two weeks that I spent with him, he told me he loved me more than he ever had in his life. I'd sit in the room with him at his house working diligently beside the hospice nurse to make sure he was comfortable. I gave him his medication whenever it was time and made sure he wasn't in any pain. I fed him when he was no longer able eat on his own, placed ice packs on his forehead to break fevers.   He didn't talk too much in the last few days, but I did read him a book about finding his own personal legend. He wasn’t able to respond, but I knew he heard me. I didn’t want him to feel alone.   Later after reading to him, I lifted up my six year old daughter to give him a kiss on the forehead and say bye for the night. She told him bye and said she’d love him forever. She also said she’d be sure to tell everyone how much he loved us. As I took her out of the room, my grandfather stopped breathing. He passed that night. It's been exactly a month since he died. If there was one thing I could have changed, it would have been talking to him more. Please help me honor him by calling your parents or grandparents today. And please send me an e-mail to know what you guys talked about.

May 2016,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/05/18/stories-from-fort-mcmurrays-fire/,"May 2016, 18",Stories from Fort McMurray’s Fire,"I live in Edmonton, Alberta. From what I gather, the big fire in Fort McMurray has probably made the news lately wherever you live.

Last week, a devastating forest fire tore into the city, forcing almost 90,000 people to evacuate. The fire consumed entire neighbourhoods, destroying 2400 structures. People from Fort McMurray won’t be able to return for some time, and they are living with strangers all across the province, including tens of thousands here in Edmonton.

I want to share some of the stories I’ve heard:

-A firefighter who wouldn’t stop after he and his crew failed to save his house from the flames, and while it was burning to the ground, moved on to the next house to save it. And then kept fighting to save other peoples’ homes for another 22 hours.

-The school teacher who made the decision to pile school children into a bus and drive them to safety for hours – and the kids who didn’t complain once.

-The mom carrying two children, who ran up to a man evacuating, and asked if he had room for two in his truck. He didn't, so without skipping a beat, he gave her - a complete stranger - the keys to his $80,000 car, and only upon reflection later realized that she had selflessly asked if he’d had room for 2 - not 3.

-The people of Fort McKay First Nation, who opened their homes to evacuees and fed and housed them – only to have to evacuate themselves when the fire got too close.

-The oil companies who sheltered and fed thousands free of charge, and evacuated them out by air when supplies ran low and the fire came close.

-The Syrian Refugees who’d lost their homes so recently, and pooled their resources to help those who lost theirs in Fort McMurray.

-The restaurants, bars, pharmacies, attractions, animal shelters, airbnbs, taxi drivers, parks, museums, storage facilities, summer camps, hotels, masseuses, movie theaters, landlords, opera, dress shops, carwashes, toy stores, artists, celebrities, strip club (yep, even the strip clubs), escape rooms, banks, electricity companies, clothing stores, seniors lodges, and thousands of everyday people who have offered up their wares, money, and services free of charge to evacuees.

-The municipal staff who stayed behind and worked around the clock to keep the water treatment plant running so the firefighters would continue to have water pressure to fight the fire.

-The people who piled two fainting goats into the cab of their truck and drove 10 hours to escape the flames.

-The man who escaped Fort McMurray, only to return to his home thousands of kilometers away in Cape Breton to find out it had burned to the ground.

-The man who lost his job, but was so grateful that his house was still standing that he wanted to donate his evacuee financial assistance cheques to someone who needed it more.

-Countless people driving through smoke, ash and embers, with flames towering next to them, their fuel light on, hoping they’ll make it out before running out of gas.

-The firefighters, pilots, police officers, paramedics and first responders who saved most of the city and got everyone out.

-Everyone who donated to the Red Cross.

If you are able, please consider making a donation to Canada’s Red Cross – Fort McMurray fire appeal.

For the past year, I have been seeking something that would make me happy. Little did I know, there was something, someone, that had been there all along. Someone I had been overlooking. Whether related to a relationship or a career, I have been chasing this “ideal” that society built for me, a socially constructed ideal, if you will. While I was chasing this ideal, I denied who I was and my passions along with it, but then, in a class with Dr. Cynthia McClintock, I found her.

I wanted to take both the LSAT and the GMAT because I thought that law school and business school would direct me toward a stable, socially acceptable career.She is passionate about Latin America and China, and wants nothing more than to work to strengthen the China-Latin America relationship. Her love for Latin America and her roots in China perfectly meshed together.I chased after jobs with consulting firms thinking that I would be happy with a ridiculously high salary and crazy hours. I thought I wanted to work for marketing companies and join their creative teams to make the best ads.She knew that to chase after opportunities working to ameliorate the relations between the two parties would make her happy, really, really, happy. For her, this passion has been there all along and it made absolute sense. In this class, she found a place where external factors and society could not direct her path. She looked within herself, to find what was already there, what has always been there.

Three weeks ago, I took off my blinders. I looked outside the overwhelming socially constructed ideals I had used to shape my ambitions and interpret my passions.Three weeks ago, I met someone who could make me happy.

Just in time for graduation, I realized that someone is me. I have decided that after my post-grad travels, I will return to Washington, D.C. to find a job that aligns with my passions: bridging the gap between Latin America and China. Whatever I must do, I will because I will never let myself be unaware of what makes me happy, again.

Metaphors aside, I really did meet someone three weeks ago… it has been one of the scariest experiences of my life, to be so vulnerable, but I am the happiest I have ever been.

So if you hear of any Latin America-China opportunities, I would appreciate it if you could pass it along. I will be looking for openings in Washington, D.C. but also in Latin America and China starting this July.

May 2016,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/05/16/a-try-hard-trying-hard/,"May 2016, 16",A Try-Hard Trying Hard,"Why does it feel like the moment you try to put all your effort into something, you lose the sense to do it immediately? Like writing this email or learning to surf or sitting down to write a screenplay about a zombie high school marching band? Such a great idea at first (okay, maybe not that last one), but then you try too hard to nail it down and the reason you wanted to do the thing in the first place seems to just slip through your fingers.

So my question is: what the fuck's with that?

Once commitment has been made to doing a thing (take for example, writing this email), what is the force that keeps us from nailing it down?

Is it the fear of judgement? What will 22k people think of my email? Internet trolls are real and vicious and perfectly rational to fear.

Is it the indecision itself? The too-late realization that I could have talked about literally anything else?

The fear of comparison? Does my story not measure up to those of great discovery, enlightenment, and hopefulness? Or even worse, is my story boring compared to that of a great tragedy?

Or the worst fear of all: that I'm actually horrible at writing emails - worse at it than anyone else in the world and I'm not even aware of it - and therefore, by default, I'll send the shittiest email.

What I'm trying too hard to get at is: why is anxiety such a bitch? It gets in the way of accepting failure as a truth that all humans face. And while it is narcissistic in nature, anxiety deflates instead of inflates. It allows for space instead of taking up space. It makes try hards try harder.

But I guess my final question is: is being a try hard such a bad thing? Could I have filled my Listserve email with someone else's inspirational quote? Yes. But, and here comes the nachos-sauce-from-an-amusement-park level cheese, if only one other person reads this and feels the same way, I guess that's the point then. I guess the answer is: not always.

In a city as big as New York, and a world as big as ours, you'd think it'd be an easy answer. But as a millennial twentysomething, I'm still trying to figure it out.

Sometimes when she hugs me I feel our breaths exchange atoms, my arms drape her waist, I squeeze out the seconds and the sound waves between us and I huddle underneath her love, nestled in the safest place between two throbbing oceans. 

And sometimes she is caustic, acid, snappingly sharp; she guts me with her disgust and her steel and I am so small, so small, so small.

How do I love this person, this sister of mine? How do I reconcile her drenching love and her scraping need to do good with her spikiness, her teeth, her spite? I want I want I so want to love her without reservation, to cherish every iota of time and space we get to share, to stand our ground in our jagged strip of human history and say: forgive me, love me, I love you. 

Scald me if you like, but you should know that it burns, and why do you hurt the people you love?

-Like a wrangler on the prairie Chasing buffalo I roam,  Riding hope and faith of many, destination still unknown .... 

Conscious, clueless, sick and weary... standing still with art in hand,Riding hope and faith of many heading home to make a-mend

Maybe I will be forgotten, maybe I will scar the path, ...maybe presence is illusion, right until the final wrath

May 2016,11,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/05/11/people-over-things/,"May 2016, 11",people over things,"This past fall, after graduating University, I was hiking the Camino de Santiago. On day 3 I was seated at a dinner table with a Vagabond. He had no home, no family, one small daypack filled with one pair of sweatpants, one shirt, one sweatshirt, two pairs of socks, one pair of shoes, a winter hat and a toothbrush. We wandered down to the river after dinner, engaged in a conversation, and words cannot begin to describe how inherently happy this man proved to be.

The Camino itself is a minimalistic journey, where you bring just what you can carry on your back. But all of a sudden my packed 58 oz Osprey backpack seemed entirely unnecessary and I wanted to toss it off the edge of the next mountain we crossed.

I walked the next few days with this man, alongside my sister and other friends we met along the way, and I learned more than I could have imagined - about cultures, norms, lifestyles. I wondered why I spent so much of my time in anxious consideration of how to carve out my perfect life, when in reality all that mattered was the present moment I was in. Life cannot be predicted or prescribed, and it's occurrences are largely out of our control. But we CAN control how we react to our days, and what we bring on the journey of life.

Material things aside, this man inspired me to limit what I carry on my metaphorical ""backpack."" Hanging on to negative memories, unkind people, broken relationships and past anxieties suddenly proved their weight, and I did everything I could to leave them behind.

I continue to be the same person, traveling the world, loving my family and friends, asking questions and seeking deeper understanding, but all of it seems so much easier now with a lighter backpack and the mentality shared with me by this particular Vagabond; the world is our home, and the people in our homes make our lives what they are.

I currently live in Boston, MA but am traveling internationally for 6 weeks, on a Galapagos cruise at the moment. If you want to talk travel or love, or have a passion for gaining a deeper understanding of the world around us, I would love to be in contact. I have so much to say but the middle of the ocean is not conducive to strong wifi, so this had to be brief.

Always remember, love is the answer.

I grew up in upcountry and came to the city when attending my college, I was so scared of the freedom, the exposure, the new environment and people I met. (I was scared because I had interacted with old men in their 70's  and some would open up and share their experience in life, what they achieved and what they regret to date). I came to realize the out come of their life was because of the simple daily decisions they made while they were young.

Because of this, I decided to look for a Mentor, who will guide and advice me in my Teenage life, it's now 10 years and he has not only been a mentor in my teenage life but also in my relationships, investments and major decisions that I make. I desire to be a good person who will make a difference in the Society at Large, to give hope, encourage others, to give a helping hand and that's just me.

 Best Regards

However, the bread and butter for someone at my level tends to be more prosaic bar and club work, with the kind of requests that make for excellent tweets. Here are some highlights from over the years. 

* Have you got something for someone who's with someone but wants to fuck someone else?* Have you got that song? Its by a blonde lady?* Play some Avicii, Avicii is hip hop. [At a hip hop night, this girl stuck around for around 20 minutes arguing her case] * Play something a bank manager would like, you know, like 50 Cent or Lil Wayne or something* Do you do requests? ""well, that depends on the request really"" OK - so what's a good song?* Can you turn this one off, I don't know it [was during Fleetwood Mac - Everywhere]* Have you got the one by the black guy? You know... wotsisname* For the next song can you play one a bit like this one?* I've been here an hour, I have to say I really don't like what you are playing* Can you play something I know? ""what do you know"" Everything. But not this.* When are you gonna play my request? ""It's on now, you cheered when it came on""* Have you got that song with the beat?* Have you got Britney? ""No"" What about Take That? ""No, sorry."" Well, you must have JLS?!* Can you play something we can dance to? [while Chic - I Want Your Love was on, although that has been said to me hundreds of times in total, almost always when something absolutely classic is on]* Have you got anything good? [get this one at least once a week, generally reply with ""sorry, no - orders of the management, only allowed to play terrible music""]

And of course that time the girl who'd been moaning all night without ever actually making a request handed me a napkin which had ""You are a terrible DJ"" written on it! 

As well as music my other great passion is food and eating out around London - I have a blog called Beats & Burgers if you want to check that out, and I'm pretty much always on Twitter, find me there at @djsantero

May 2016,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/05/08/the-story-seeker/,"May 2016, 08",The story seeker,"The hardest part is the beginning, not only for writing, but for everything we do. Think about it. Am I right? It´s true! The purpose of this letter is to share a little bit of me, what I do and what I wish to do, and I hope that when someone reads this, they will say: He seems like good, let’s do something together.

I have always considered myself a Story teller, the kind of person that observes and catches a moment and let word take over the rest. This is probably because of my need of knowledge as well as not wanting to feel alone, and I think it’s due to the fact that when someone reads a something mine, they take a little part of me with them, so, if tomorrow I would die, that little part would live on.

I have just begun a new stage in my life, moving from the city of Aguascalientes to Mexico City, the capital of the country, first, to finish my thesis in cinematography studies (Yes, I am a cinephiliac), and second, to discover more stories. I mean, Mexico City has 20 million habitants and that is a huge number of stories to discover, which I love.

As many people, I have an emotional shortage, and still am in love with a person that lives in the city of Zacatecas, far away from here. It’s a story like many others, that begun with a “Hi”, and from there, a train of feelings delivered by words. She is living in that part of life when you have to live your life, do your stuff and be yourself, and I am living in the part when you feel lost. And so I moved. But as Gabriel Garcia Marquez once wrote, “Distance is not a problem, the problem is humans, because we don’t know to love without touching, seeing or listening. And love is felt with the heart, not the body”, I feel her and I like to think that her feels me as well, even with hundreds of miles between us.

I truly believe that what happens to us is not merely a random coincidence, but is always for a purpose, like having the chance to be read by you at the beginning of this new part of my life, as well as been able to help someone living in Mexico City, because “When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose”, and since I consider myself a traveler that is just passing by and as long as I keep traveling, it will be a pleasure to help you, even by just listening, which is sometimes all is needed.

Finally, about myself, my name is Carlos Alberto Prado, 31 years old, and my only unfinished business is my thesis and if someone knows about a job in Mexico City, I would be very grateful if you share it with me.

If anybody wants to be heard or be in touch, just send me a mail: 

Cheers to the Martinez Gonzalez brothers (Ignacio and Bernardo). Live Long And Prosper. And See you all later!

Yet according to wikipedia between 250 and 1,000 people in the US die each year from erotic asphyxiation.

So in the 15 years since 9/11 - between 3,750 and 15,000 people have died from that.

The US government may as well spend hundreds of billions of dollars encouraging people to jerk off more safely.Terrorism is shocking and tragic. But it always surprises me that so much money is spent on it when it is such a rare way for people to die. Particularly when it is pretty much impossible to prevent in any case.

There are now thirteen times as many suicides as murders in the UK.

When walking home late at night the footsteps you should be afraid of, statistically, are your own. You are far more likely to kill yourself.

I have studied magic my whole life. The best thinker in magic today is an anonymous writer called Andy. He has a blog called The Jerx.

-------------------------

Wanna' see a trick?

""This is a mystical trick that I learnt in Australia – the continent ‘down under’…""

Go grab a deck of cards – it doesn’t need to be complete.

Shuffle the deck and freely divide it into 4 packets ie cut the deck into 4 piles.

Pick up any packet and shuffle it. Look at the top card and remember it.

Now spell “Australian Shuffle” – transferring one card from top to bottom for each letter. This helps lose the card in the packet.

Once you have done that. We will now use the mysterious ‘Australian Shuffle’ to find your card.

First – I should explain what an ‘Australian’ Shuffle is – it is a DOWN/UNDER deal. So place the top card down on the table, and the next card under the packet – and so on…

Do this until you have one card remaining in your hand.

It is your selected card!

--------------------------

We can use magic to entertain people. Or to scam them.

--------------------------

Take a deck of cards and place them in red/black order:

RED/BLACK/RED/BLACK… etc.

You then take the top card (a RED card) and insert the card anywhere into the deck. A nice way of doing this is to spread the cards face-down on the table and have the spectator insert the FACE UP red card anywhere they want.

You then tell the spectator you will deal off a pair of cards at a time. If the FACE UP red card in the pair is with another red card. He wins. If it is with a black card – you win. Thanks to The Gilbreath Principle you will always win.

Free money! Yeah!!!

---------------------------

Relativity is not really about time. It is about what do we mean by the word ""Now""?

There is no single thing called ""Now"" that applies to the whole universe. Instead there are an infinite number of ""Nows"" depending on where you are in the universe. Two events only share the same ""Now"" if they occur in the same place at the same time.

For centuries, philosophers thought about time. And in doing so they smuggled in the assumption that inherent to the concept of time is that simultaneous events will be the same for all observers. Indeed this was such a buried assumption – that no philosopher even bothered to note it when analyzing the concept of time.

Then Einstein came along – teased out this assumption and the rest is history. To me - Einstein was a philosopher more than he was a physicist.

The night that I signed the papers, I went for a walk down Mt. Auburn street. I played BellX1’s 'Built to Last' on repeat. Around me, trees reached their bare branches into the darkness, their last leaves descending among footfalls on cobblestone streets, where students wrapped in coats and fuzzy boots dissolved into the soft shadow and warm glow of street lights, sounds of laughter in Cambridge on a late fall evening.

It was the first real employment contract I’d signed, as a 22-year-old coming straight out of college into a tech startup. The CEO and I were the last ones in the office, sunset giving way to darkness outside as I read through pages of non-compete and non-disclose and salary contract. They asked for prior art. ""What have you done?,” said the voice in my head, “what have you done that gives you the right to be here?"" It was a voice that I’d get to know intimately well over the next few years. I drew a picture of a time machine, because you never know.

Alongside the other papers was a shareholder agreement granting me a tiny portion of the company. “Right now it's worth a few cents,” the CEO told me, “but it could eventually amount to something.” I signed it.

What followed were weeks, months, years of hard work. We think of technology as something intellectual, but my experience of technology has always been distinctly human. What you make as a company is a reflection of who you are and who you are growing into, and all of these things come from people and the way they feel about their work. The undertow to your every day is a deep hunger for growth that drives everything around you. At a startup, change is the air you breathe. You never live the same experience twice, so it's up to you to really be there. I wish I’d asked more stupid questions, I wish I’d gone to the afterparties and stayed up later talking to friends. I wish I hadn’t been in such a hurry to grow up.

I found out that we’d been bought from a text message when I got home from a week at a monastery out west. Our team of 30 was now over 300, soon to be part of one of the largest software companies in the world. My shares that had been worth a few cents did end up being worth something. Which is nice - makes me feel like I’ve done something, like I am somebody.

In a few weeks I’ll be signing new paperwork, this time for the big company. There will be a section for prior art - what have I done? I’ll put down a few apps and a technology podcast with a friend. I’ll detail the plans for an all-nighter spent pushing a release, for Mexican food in the morning, for chaider and Darwin’s sandwiches and accidentally drawing hamburgers on walls without whiteboard paint. I’ll mention flying drones from a rooftop and scaring strangers in the street; drinking old wine from the fridge and dancing until last call; building great things with friends. A damn good recipe for banana guacamole. And a time machine. You never know.

I’m working on a documentary about how humans interact with smart devices and apps. The project is called If You Build It, and so far I’ve filmed about 50 interviews. If you have an interesting story about how smart devices have affected your life, or just want to be part of the film, email me.

Everything I Threw Away During My Day Off, the Thirtieth of April in the Year of Our Lord 2016

1. 1 ball of tinfoil that had previously wrapped an egg-cheese-bagel from Lite Bites on Steinway

2. 3 used napkins included with the bagel

3. 1 small plastic mango nectar bottle from Patel Brothers on 74th St.

4. 1 small aluminum can of Limca soda from PB

5. 1 tiny price tag dangling from a pair of dollar store sunglasses, cut off by the cashier (37th Ave.)

6. 1 pamphlet advertising palm reading from a guy on 37th

7. 1 liter water bottle with an athlete's spout cap thing from a different dollar store on 37th

8. 1 piece of Extra Polar Ice gum and its wrapper in a garbage on 34th Ave.

9. Maybe two forkfuls of rice untouched by any curry at Indian Taj's buffet on 74th St.

10. 1 golf ball-sized clump of cat hair, cumulatively scraped off my cat, Mingus

11. About 1/2 pint of milk that'd gone bad, dumped down my drain

12. 1 plastic freshness ring from a jar of PB halva, recycled

13. 2 mango spears and their baggy, forgotten in a pocket and crushed and warm

14. 1 Food Bazaar bag of cat poop

And that's it, I guess, nothing crazy. Shouts to Ari.

All of my favorite emails on here have been fiction or easy recipes, and though I'm a better reader than writer, I've got both a recipe and a story!

Story first:I have a wonderful older sister, who when she went away to college, told me that in the dining hall, you could get a waffle with the school logo on it.

I wanted one. But when I went to (a different) college, I couldn't get a college-themed waffle. I felt deprived and sad. It's silly, but I thought it was a great idea, and I wanted one so badly!

During sophomore year, I started wondering how hard could it really be to get one made?

I was pretty much all talk though, until about a year after graduation.

At that point, I decided enough talk, I was going to get my waffle iron!

It took two years, but it's happened! Ironically, due to the way licensing for colleges work, I still don't have my dream waffle iron.

But I'm closer. I've learned to negotiate, cold call, hire artists and deal with shipping containers full of waffle irons, as well as taste-test waffle recipes (the hardest job by far)! Though I will admit, it's a little hard to explain to people exactly what it is that I do for work.

There have been days that I'm swimming in syrup, but I'm licensed to sell college logo waffle irons for the University of Miami, Florida State University and the University of Florida. I'm in some stores, and hope to get into more.

You can find my company at tsquaredwaffles, hoping to bring the love of your college to the breakfast table. It's my baby and I hope to expand, and maybe add your school! (And certainly add mine.) I'm proud of what I did, but most of all, I'm happier to do it then what I had originally thought I'd do when I was in school.

As I mentioned, I have made a lot of waffles over the past two years and this is my family's go-to recipe for waffles- (yield 3-ish waffles-it's machine dependent) Can also be used for pancakes, or according to one uncle, for fried chicken.

Classic Waffle Batter½ cup of Milk1 cup of Flour¼ tsp Baking Soda¼ tsp Salt¾ cup Sugar1 EggCan be improved with chocolate chips (as is life).

Hat Tip to my friend Julissa for the listserv introduction & GO DORES!

Misc. things before signing off-

My heart lies in Nashville, but I do not.

Read a book and eat a waffle, though probably not at the same time.

Happy days,Teresa

In lieu of having something witty and insightful for everyone to enjoy, here is my go-to list of recommended things:Fiction: The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (near future sci-fi about a prison on the moon)Non-fiction: Pot Shards (the autobiography of a former US ambassador to South Korea)Music: House of Heroes (american rock)Instrumental music: Snarky Puppy (jazz fusion)Movie: The Prestige (period drama about stage magic)TV show: Orphan Black (can’t say much without ruining it, but it’s great)Podcast: No Agenda (two guys banter about news, society, politics, and whatever else they feel like)

A question for everyone: I'm looking for pieces of culture (books, movies, TV shows, non-fiction writing, &c.) that explore the period of time between a future apocalypse and a dystopian society. It seems like there's lots of stories of an apocalypse and lots of stories of messed up worlds that appeared after an apocalypse, but not many of the time of recovering/creating a new society. Something like between the zombie apocalypse, and the world of The Hunger Games. So far, the best I've found is The Walking Dead.

I believe in magic.

I grew up with my nose stuck in a book, many books, and it made me believe in magic. I never really thought people could make things levitate, or that a frog could actually be a prince, but I believed in the message behind it. Acceptance, trust, kindness, friendship, love, things that made the magic possible. Child me believed that if I had those things inside me, magic would be real.

Fast forward to adult me, in the Harry Potter theme park, waiting in line behind a small child that wasn’t born when the last book came out, ready to try the new interactive attraction. You wave the wand in the correct way and say the spell, and magic happens. Well, it actually works with a sensor that captures the movement that comes from the very expensive interactive wand. Saying the spell isn’t even really required, there is no microphone. But it works. Wave your wand and you can make a magical creature move, you can summon water from an umbrella or open curtains for a puppet show. What I realized there was that they designed magic. Fake, but actual magic.

People have been designing magic for a long time. What if we could talk to people that are far away? What if we could send letters in one second? What if we could fly? Maybe we can’t create exactly the same designs from my books, but we can get pretty close. Science fiction and fantasy can inspire design to think forward, to imagine what the future could be like, so we can design for it.

It can be in small, silly things like making an animatronic phoenix talk in a theme park, or in wicked problems that affect so many people around the world. We can design magic if we can accept our users and understand them for who they are, not who we want them to be. If we trust our skills to build it and our team to work together. And if we are kind and can imagine a better future.

This I believe.

April 2016,28,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/04/28/that-itch-you-cant-shake/,"April 2016, 28",That Itch You Can't Shake.,"For most of my life I wanted to live near the ocean. This was spurred on by the fact that I lived in Scotland for 3 years in a town right on the North Sea and had a brief stint living in Bermuda. I lived in both of these places before I was 12. After that I spent the next 24 living in Ontario.

For most of my life, I have had a love affair with creating and performing. Performing with bands, choirs, musical theatre etc. I wanted to pursue a career in the arts.

I pursued instead the ministry and for 18 plus years served in various positions caring for youth. In that career I saw all aspects of life, pain, misery, joy and success. I saw how when people believed in something bigger than themselves amazing things could be accomplished. I also witnessed how people can hide behind religion and do very dark things.

I got married to who was the love of my life, and when she was in a car accident 3 years after, it changed both of our lives. I lost her that day. Short term memory loss, Personality Change, Chronic Pain and PTSD. It was the hardest thing I have ever had to go through. As we realized over the following 3 years that we could not make it work.

As a result of the divorce, I stepped down from ministry and began doing youth work in group homes eventually acting as a live in foster dad. Then one winter day four years ago I was tobogganing with the teens I worked with and broke my collarbone.

I was burnt out and broken, but I needed time to recuperate. So I did what any normal person does with a broken shoulder, I went to Cancun, Mexico. I went ziplining, kayaking, swam in a cenote (underground cave) and climbed up a temple. As I sat by the ocean I realized that I was not living my life for me, but for others and had just run out of steam to be good for anyone yet alone myself.

As I flew back I made a resolution to move to the ocean and start from there. It was a start and I had no idea what it was going to bring. I packed my car with everything I could fit in it and started the drive from Markham Ontario to Victoria, British Columbia. I drove through the states and saw amazing things, Mt. Rushmore, The Badlands and so much more. When I rode the ferry across to Victoria, BC which is a small city on Vancouver Island. I knew I was home. For the first time in a long time I was surrounded by the ocean.

Itch number one: satisfied... this brings us to itch number two: the arts.

I was fortunate to make a group of friends quickly, they encouraged me to go to an audition for a musical theatre company. I was sick and almost didn't go. I did go and I was successful and my first show back was Miss Saigon. A truly amazing experience. A friend I met through that connected me to Background Performing as there was a major series coming to be filmed on the Island called Gracepoint. My first day on set, I was standing next to Nick Nolte. I pinched myself and said this was fun. (For those who know, yes I met the Doctor)

Fast forward two years later, I am now working Full Time in the Film & Television Industry here in Vancouver and without my Itches that would not go away I would not be here.

There is so much more to this story, but alas I have run out of words, but I leave you with these questions.

What is your Itch? What is stopping you from scratching it? Will it take a broken bone to snap you out of it?

Cheers,Andrew Suttar

Let me tell you a quick story about Lydia, whose name I will not change to protect the innocent.  :)Lydia and I are both in our late 30s.  More than 15 years ago, she would spend time at my house with other friends, though I was never home during these visits.  She was a waitress at one of my favorite restaurants in Kansas City.  We would frequent the same spots around town, yet we “missed out” on several opportunities to meet.  We have both been married, but it took Tinder for us to finally meet last summer.  Even though I say we “missed out”, we really didn’t!  We have both had amazing lives, and just weren’t ready for each other.  Today, we’re happily engaged and in the process of buying a new home together.  We’re calling this “The 3rd Chapter”.  We believe we saved the best for last in the story of our lives!

Other random things going through my head right now that I would like to say:Don’t live the same year 75 times, and call it a life.Get a passport.  Fill it with stamps.  Repeat.Be active!  I used to tip the scale.  For most of my life, I was morbidly obese.  At my heaviest I weighed 400 pounds.  Those days are behind me.  Over the course of a year and a half beginning in 2009, I lost more than half my body weight simply by making better decisions and exercising.  YOU CAN DO IT TOO!

His silence confirmed what I already knew, because I'd seen my 15 year old cousin's Facebook post that our grandma died after a painstakingly slow decent into dementia, coupled with a painstakingly short stint with pneumonia. I hadn't lost anyone of this importance to me yet in my life, and it will remain a moment that broke me in a way that is unfix-able. The problem with her dying on November 7th is that I was one week into National Novel Writing month. I was young, without any responsibilities, so the only obviously choice was to spend my November attempting to pen 50,000 words in-between classes and vacations. I was roughly 11,000 words in to my novel on the night I received that call from my dad. My main character was an annoying narrator who was stifling my voice. Every page was a challenge. Every word was wrong. Grief has a funny way of helping you reevaluate everything you know. On November 8th, when I sat down on a bench in Old Town Square with my small notepad from Tesco, a supporting character took over. He nudged my annoying narrator out of the way and started tell his story. I kept shaking my head as ink just flew from my pen making words and stories. I had no idea where they came from. WWII? Engineering? Geriatrics? WTF? I thought he was the opposite of me: he was old, weathered, and depressed. He didn’t like being alive. With every word that I wrote, I realized we were more alike than different. By the middle of the month, I realized I had written a 30,000 word manifesto of my grief under the guise of Eddie. All the pain and weird angst and hurt and numbness became words I wrote on any scrap of paper or receipt I could get my hands on.

Don't get me wrong-- now I am blissfully happy, in the greatest love I have ever seen, and am grateful for every opportunity I am afforded--but that night, I started my journey through a very dark forest that took me a month to get to the edge of. That's what it's like, right? When you see the face of someone you love, but isn't in your life anymore, out of the corner of your eye? It's like I can catch glimpses of the sun shining through the branches of these pines I'm navigating through, but I won't really ever see the sun again. I won't ever feel its deep, deep warmth fully. That moment of silence from my father pulled a rug out from under me and I've been slowly spinning in slow motion ever since. But through those 50,000 words, I came to understand myself through Eddie. I am so grateful that he showed up and turned the light on for me, because on that night I started spinning, it was very dark.

If you’re in the dark, pick up a pen. You never know who is inside of you, ready to illuminate a path out of the forest.

Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light. -Steven Kloves (screenplay), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, 2004, spoken by the character Albus Dumbledore

For this story we go to the country of Georgia which I visited. At some point we ended up in a tiny village called Sighnagi.  To give you an idea how much tourism is developed there, the first name of the woman running the guesthouse we stayed was ‘Nazi’. When she started her guesthouse she named it after herself. So there we were - staying in the Nazi guesthouse.

That night miss Nazi invited us into the basement for dinner with the rest of her family. We looked a bit surprised to find out that these were all men and even more that they were exchanging and looking at pistols they all brought with them.

We started eating and drinking and shared the table with a British couple, a girl and a boy. We ate, toasted and drank wine. Now you have to know  that toasting in Georgia is quite an important occasion. You tell a short story about and after that you toast on that. Everybody joins in and chucks the glass down completely. Then it is time for the next toast. etc. etc.

At some point the family table got really quiet and everybody stood up to make a toast. This looked very official so we decided to also stand up. When we did this hell broke loose and they all started shouting at us. We figured we made a mistake and all sat down again. Then they started shouting even more, leaving us all confused. It turned out that all the men were invited to join, but that the girl was not allowed. Because of this combined with alcohol she stormed off crying.

We were then invited to join the table and continued the toast. It turned out that they were remembering their fallen brothers from the army and to put so extra emphasis on that, the biggest guy took out his pistol, took out the bullets and put them in our wine glasses. We raised our glass and toasted. After this they went to the balcony to start shooting in the air.

This was the limit for miss Nazi. She stormed into the kitchen and kicked all those strong men out of her house one by one.

The next morning we talked with her for a while and she got out a photo album. She showed pictures from just after the fall of the Sovjet Union. Her husband had lost his job and they were only living on the vegetables they could grow in their own garden.  Until one day she saw a couple of people she had never seen before wearing colourful things on their backs. Without hesitation miss Nazi pushed her entire family into one room and invited the backpackers to stay with them.

After that more backpacks came, and more. At some point she managed to buy a bigger house and after that an even bigger one. Slowly but steady miss Nazi had build her own empire in the small town of Sighnaghi, making everybody who lived there dependant on her. You want a taxi? Miss Nazi would take care of it. A tour in the wine gardens? Go get miss Nazi.

So while on a first look in Georgia it all looked very masculine, basically everywhere we came it turned out that if you look a bit further than that there was always the same person running the whole business: the misses Nazi of this world.

My liver failure. It was weird how it happened. Had an uncontrollable chill that rocked me to my bones. Went to the hospital and the doctors told me it was some bacteria. Pills I took gave me an allergic reaction, rushed to the hospital and then it all went sour. Kept getting sick. got more pills. Little did I know that you’re always doing a bit of harm to your liver when you’re taking pills. So weak that I started walking diagonally. seriously!…my brain thought it was normal….My liver was at a point of failing. Doctors said it was all the meds I took…all I can do was stay in bed for close to two months. My family are wonderful humans but I couldn’t be a burden on them.  For the first time in my life I was alone and weak. Hated the fact that I was not able to do anything. No books, no movies, no activities. I would get headaches if I did anything. The only thing I was able to do was take a cold hard look at my life. for two months. Death was around me. .and looking back I feel like it was asking me whether I should be given a second chance at life or not. (Getting all teary eyed thinking of the moment). death does that to you….has you put your life in perspective. Has you wondering if what you are becoming is what you really want to become. And then I knew. I wasn’t becoming what I wanted to be. And I didn’t want to go.. Looking back I know that incident wasn’t a coincidence. It had to happen that way. Coming face to face with Death changed my life for the better.

I Looooove creating images. I am a seer and image maker. I see things. I see them when I am awake overlaying “reality”. They come to me when I sleep. I started taking them seriously after my run in with death. I spend a bit of time birthing them. My image creating capabilities grow stronger with each piece. Will be having an exhibition soon as my babies are growing in number. Please come.

Met and fell in love with this being a while back. She saved my life. I believe she is an enlightened soul and she is going to change the world. She is a she…well she resides in a female body but she is a phenomenal human being. Once you look beyond the genitals or any other form of category and you define them as human being there’s just so much you can learn. Well my first lesson was to see her as human and not as a woman. She is an amazing woman. She heals souls and shapes them into something grand they see themselves becoming. She is a work of art. She is perfect. Not in the way we were thought perfect will look like (which in my belief is total bullshit) She's perfect by embracing everything she is and isn’t and being in total alignment with everything inside of her and outside of her. Watching her talk and be who she is like listing to the wind play its beautiful tunes through leaves on a very cool late summer afternoon.

We plan to do magic in the not so distant future. We already are doing magic together. But we would love to grow our family. Send me an email if you are looking to be more then what you currently are.

As a young adult I wasn't too obese, but once I met my wife the weight just seemed to pile on. She is a great cook. I was also what you would describe as extremely lazy.

In 2008, at the age of 32, I became a father. It is a cliché I know, but becoming a father really changes everything. The best way to explain that shift is that before my son, my life centered around me. Sure, there were people in my life I loved above everything else in the world. But ultimately I was still at the center of my own life. And once I became a father, that little guy became the center of my life. I was bumped to a supporting role, and his future became more important than mine.

Then in 2012, my father died. The cause was health related, although it was not something directly applicable to me. It still got me thinking about my own mortality. I had not felt ready to lose my father. When would my son lose his? How much of his life would I get to see?

At this point, I weighed 131 kilos (288 pounds). I had felt the weight weighing me down for years already. My last physical showed some troubling liver values related to obesity. I was eating antacid for heartburn. Tying my shoes was a strain, drying my feet after a shower even more so. And playing with my kid was exhausting.

I started worrying about my own health, and decided I had to do something. So when January 2013 came around I started a gym membership. Small sessions of treadmill jogging and machine exercises two times a week.

During the next 18 months I went from no dietary changes (exercise alone did nothing on the scale) through keeping a food diary (choosing healthier alternatives resulted in losing 1 kilo a month) to a 1000 calorie a day deficit (losing 1 kilo a week). My wonderful wife joined me for the last part.

The spring of 2014 a friend of mine convinced me to sign up for a local series of outdoor running races. I never thought I had a competitive streak, but I was hooked from the first run! That summer I finished my first 10k at 1:07:57 and my weight leveled out around 96 kilos (211 pounds).

When the fall came I booked a personal trainer to learn proper weight training. Forcing myself out the door to go to the gym was no longer a problem. After three days without exercise, I would become restless. The habit was built! During that winter I kept running through hail and snow.

My next 10k run (the Midnight Sun Maraton in the city of Tromsø where I live) the summer of 2015 ended at 50:32! And in the fall I participated in my first half marathon (21 km / 13 miles) and finished at 2:09:48.

I have truly turned my life completely around, and I own my midlife crisis. It is mine, and I am proud of it. Many people have asked me where I found the motivation. What got me out of the sofa when it was dark and rainy outside? And the answer will always be the same.

It was all for my son.

Greetings,

Since I’m me, I want to talk about me.

There is a lot to say. Sorry if I’m not very articulate. I'm writing this last minute due to my procrastination and a funeral yesterday.

I recently turned 24, I always like to explore. At 21, I quit my corporate job and dropped out of college to travel the world. I managed to travel the states.

I prepared for a year and saved my money. In November 2013 I began my travels; I took trains from the east coast to the west coast. With some money, a big backpack, some clothes, some camping gear I headed out to nowhere. Met some nice people and made lifelong friends. I stayed at some hostels. Worked on some farms. Bought a camper van that lasted a little while. Did some camping and some hiking. Got stranded on highway 1 (a whole story in itself.). Met a girl on the run (a whole story in itself.) Picked up some hitchhikers (stories in itself.). Did some hitchhiking. Learned a lot. Travelling alone for months at a time was the best thing Iv'e ever done.

I was on a journey to give up giving up attachment….

I learned a few things like “Always ask a blind man what he sees”

or “Chop the Buddha’s head off”

and “Sometimes when there is a sudden void, the void rushes to be filled"".....

It was an objection to my projection, seeking attention. “Where the attention goes energy flows.” What kind of attention did I seek? What kind of attention would I attract?

I grew up in a super insular suppressed religious community and I needed to go explore myself.

Back then I would say I was going to travel because I needed to spend time alone. I ended up meeting hundreds of people. Mostly wonderful people.

Only one psychopath. (Term used loosely) He traumatized me. But he gave me a lot of insight into myself. He particularly gave me insight into my biological mother (who I hadn't seen in many years). Who I subsequently called.

After getting away from this guy. I found myself doing yoga for the first time in my life. I had been 'into' meditation for about two years at the time.I met a fellow named Bill who did yoga with me. Outside in sun.

Then some strange things started coming together.

After years of my shoulders being by my ears my back started straightening out. A strange tingling feeling ran up and down my spine. My body went from hot to cold. I would lapse easily into a trance.I started going back to my childhood. Things I have repressed.

I sent home my 'spiritual books' Ram Dass - Be Here Now and Alan Watts - The Way of Zen. There great. But I had to face this on my own.

I realized what I called: Trauma. It was fucking staring me in the face a whole time.

I cried and laughed. I realized I had massive trauma from my childhood that I had been running from. And I started realizing how it affected me. The way I interacted with people. The type of people my energy attracted.

A major point is: it wasn't my fault. Stockholm syndrome comes to mind. Its survival. I never knew better. A defense/ coping mechanism.

Trauma attracts trauma. Trauma passes trauma. Does trauma fix trauma?

I also realized my suppression and repression. Particularly sexually - which I will talk about.

I'll say my mother was quite abusive.I called my mother.I was up for days straight without sleeping.Managed to lose all my belongings.Get arrested and spend a night in jail.

“Sometimes when there is a sudden void, the void rushes to be filled"" -A man named Red

Thoughts running through my brain. Insights. Illusion. Confusion. Delusion.

I learned so much about myself. And the universe. I am still learning from this experience.

I also finally started to admit to myself the closet I have been in all my life.  Its the BDSM closet.

There is probably many reasons but secrets and suppression can lead to mania and psychosis.

This episode was the best feeling in my life and the most terrifying feeling of my life.

I ended up stretching my ham strings and dancing on a shoulder of a highway.

Then I had a cop pointed at taser at me arrested me and brought me in to the emergency room. There, I was strapped down to a gurney. And given a shot in my arm. I woke up in a psychiatric hospital. Where I spent the next 2 weeks.

I'm running out of time.

But let me say.

To those of you who have had psychiatric issues, You Can Bounce back. You can make a life for yourself.  It's terrible, I don't need to go into our pain. But YES you can be okay. Please I beg you. Love yourself. Forgive yourself and forgive yourself for having to forgive yourself.

To my kinky friends out there. Rock on!  I'm still exploring myself. I still want answers. I am still discovering.I've felt isolated. Disgusted by myself. And the shame.....oh the shame.....

I managed to get my shit together. I'm blessed. Thanks for reading. Have a good one.

So that's the short confusiong version.

Feel free to write to me.

April 2016,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/04/09/i-was-adopted/,"April 2016, 09",I Was Adopted,"Occasionally I find myself saying just that. ""I was adopted."" Often it's in response to questions about my family history, or it comes up when I'm asked about my birth. When it's in a personal setting, the follow-up is always the same: ""Have you thought about finding your mom?"" (Interestingly, no one ever asks if I want to find my dad.)""Yes, I've thought about it,"" I say, ""and no, I don't want to.""

My biological mother was 17 years old when I was born. She was one quarter Cherokee, and lived in Oklahoma. The adoption was arranged before my birth. That's all I know.

There have been times when I've wanted to find her -- dark times in my life, times when I wanted something different, some form of help. I imagine we all go through times when the aid of some mystical creature would be welcomed.

But as I grew older, I realized she isn't what I've imagined. She's just a person, in her late sixties if she's still alive, who probably doesn't want to start a relationship with a stranger. The one thing that gives me pause is that I could be wrong about that. Perhaps she's been hoping to find me all these years. But I hope not. I hope she's happy, with lots of wonderful relationships in her life.

I'm happy, and I have wonderful relationships, including a great mom and dad. Mom and dad are the ones who changed my poopy diapers, stood by me during tough times, raised me to be who I am. And I don't have to find them. They get mad when I go too long without calling.

I'd like to share with you a thought, a quote, and a question.  Here goes:

A THOUGHT:Most of the time when you go to see a play there is only one stage. All of the events take place on that one stage, before everyone's eyes.  Everyone is watching the same thing.

But there is also a play called Tamara by John Krizanc, where actors are spread out across 10 or 11 different rooms. They all perform at the same time. The audience (rather than sitting down) walks through the different rooms and sees different bits and pieces of the same production.  The result: No two people see the exact same play.

I think this is a good metaphor for what happens in life too. The world, ""reality"", whatever you want to call it - it takes place on a billion different stages and is constantly unfolding. We don't have access to all stages. We can't possible watch all of them. Instead we only see what happens right in front of us, in our own personalized series of scenes. But that differs from person to person.  None of us can understand the entire play because each of us sees a different version of the same massive performance. So in that sense nobody's version of reality is truer than the next, rather everyone's perception of reality is true to some extent, but also... incomplete.

So the next time you think you know better than the person you are talking to (and let's be honest, we all do), remember Tamara.

A QUOTE:I love quotes, and I think that this one by Aristotle ties in nicely to Tamara and the thought above.

""It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.""

Pretty good, right?  It's easy to disagree with someone. But it's a real challenge to try to understand someone you don't agree with.  That one is harder to do.  I think Aristotle's quote is just as relevant today as it was 2,300 years ago when he first wrote it. Although at that time it probably looked more like this:

""Είναι το σημάδι ενός εκπαιδευμένου μυαλού για να είναι σε θέση να διασκεδάσει μια σκέψη χωρίς αποδοχή του""  (probably not, but thanks anyway google translate)

A QUESTION:Eh hem... lastly, it's not every day you get the attention of 22,563 people, so here goes a big shot in the dark.  Does anyone know of any apartment vacancies or job openings in Amsterdam?  Particularly in the field of International Education. I know I would regret it if I didn't at least ask. =)

He shared an interesting piece of his professional philosophy: Never ask for introductions to people. Instead, work hard enough that they want an introduction to you. 

It's a fascinating way to think about breaking into an industry - if successful people want to meet you, then you're doing something interesting. Said another way, instead of struggling your way up the industry ladder, you should start building your own ladder until people notice. 

As I start to pursue filmmaking full-time next month, I want to hear stories or advice about how others have broken into a new industry (entertainment or otherwise). I'll compile the answers and share a single digest with those who contribute.

April 2016,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/04/06/from-sydney-with-love/,"April 2016, 06",From Sydney With Love,"When I first got the email saying I’d won The Listserve, I asked my friends in New Zealand what I should write about.

“Write about us,” Johannes said.

And so here we go.

I met Johannes, Gui, Woonie and Jim and the advertising agency we worked together at in Auckland.

On my first day of work, I was taken on a tour of the office. When we went by Jimbo and Woonie’s desks, the two of them were watching a surfing video. I asked the person giving me a tour to leave me there, and within two weeks we were out surfing the coasts of New Zealand together.

A month or so later, Gui and Johannes started working at our agency, and they joined us for surf missions.

At first, I think it was a friendship of convenience and sympathy: I didn’t have a car at the time, and the other guys saw how badly I wanted to make it out to coast to surf so they gave me a ride.

But you can only spend so many long car rides down twisty, New Zealand roads and so much time braving the icy New Zealand water with people before they became more than just work colleagues.

Some of the best days of my life were spent in those New Zealand waters with those guys.

Like the time Jimbo drove us up to Pakiri Beach and we had a section of an amazing little beach break all to our selves.

Or the time Woonie met me up at Piha on my birthday, and I caught one of the biggest lefts of my life, then bailed on it, and came up out of the water to see Woonie laughing.

Or the time Johannes and i went down to Raglan for big, messy (but otherwise almost empty) waves for a Sunday afternoon.

Or the time four of us somehow managed to cram into Johannes’ car with our boards to surf North Piha, right next to the cliff, and I dropped in on Johannes (sorry, buddy).

Or the time Gui and I went out on the coldest day of the year and had the entire beach to ourselves. (the waves weren’t great, but it was still an amazing experience).

Or any of the other times where we paddled out into the ocean off the coast of New Zealand to watch each other catch waves, or to disappear from each other’s sights when the rip was strong.

Or the Friday nights spent talking on What’s App about where the waves were best, and how early in the morning we’d want to leave.

Or on the Monday mornings at work, when we’d talk about the waves we caught over the weekend, and would start looking at the forecast.

You can only spend so many days like that, so much time spent seeing the smile on someone’s face after they’ve caught an amazing wave, or having them see one on yours, and not consider them friends.

So there you go, Johannes. I wrote about you guys. I miss you dudes and hope we connect for a surf mission again soon.

I guess if there was a moral to this story it would be to enjoy the moment.

Or maybe that the friends you make today will be your friends for life.

Or maybe that you should just get up early to go surfing. Preferably with some good friends.

A Haiku is like a painting, but in an extremely short form.

With deadly wars around the world, with indifference among many people, art is a way to help us grow sympathy.

Here I write for you some of my thoughts:

1. Being experiencedTo have experiences is not the same as being experienced. Having experiences is associated with lifestyle and how much one has aged. But being experienced depends on how much one learns from his experiences. One may undergo the same experience for years, without learning anything from it. People who do not learn from their experiences tend to become pessimistic and bitter. Therefore, between two people who have had similar experiences, the one who is happier is likely more experienced.

2. Living in the present and ethicsLiving in the present is directly related to having good morals. Those who are not bounded by the happy or sad memories of the past, and are not concerned with fears or interests that future may bring, can make decision more based on their own morals.

3. Fiends and loversFriends are best known when they stay by your side in difficulties, and lovers are best known when they keep you in mind in felicity.

It's a story we've heard before: had nowhere to live, had no way to make money, had no hope.  There was a lot of scraping by and not a lot of anything else.

I get a lot of flack because most of my stories start with ""I was in a bar...,"" but I am a human being over the age of 21 living in Wisconsin, so that sort of just happens. I was in a bar on a warm night in summer when I was asked to become a Defender of the Robot Nation.

I interrupted a date to go to the first meeting - it was in a shiny new building with glass instead of outer walls. I only knew one person, but that was enough - I signed on and I agreed to host a tournament.

I remembered when I was young - I was a nerd, I spent all my time at extracurricular activities, all I wanted was to do well and fit in, but fitting in always seemed Too Much To Ask.  Thankfully, I have since learned the superpower of Not Caring What Other People Think, but it can be a truly Sisyphean identity to maintain everyday.

I haven't told my fellow Defenders this but - having some purpose turned some things around for me.  Was life perfect? No.  Was life way better? Yes.

Who do I have to thank for turning me back into shape? A bunch of engineers and some high school students.

What is our mission? As Defenders of the Robot Nation, we continue to do everything in its power to spread the message of FIRST and create new heroes through science and technology.

If you've gotten this far, you may feel like this is a bit of a bait and switch - and let me explain, I didn't intend it to be.  Yes, this accidentally became an email about how proud I am of some high school students (they won a regional! and an imagery award!) and how mentoring them has made me feel nice things.  If you don’t know, FIRST is an acronym for For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, but what it mean, in short, is that students at all levels through high school can build robots.

Is it just about robots? No!  Most of what I end up talking about is FUNdraising (get it, it has the word fun in it), PR, media, community outreach, events, that sort of thing. I would be remiss if I did not include a quote from one of our lead mentors here:  ""We don't build robots, we build robot builders.""

I was working with a student on preparing for interview at our next competition, and he dropped a bunch of wisdom, including that our team is family (sappy, I know, but true) and that we, as a team, have decided we don’t care what other people think.  We go out in public in capes and matching shirts and we name our robots after our comic book favorites.  That’s who we are and we’re darn proud.  I’m glad this is something the students I work with are learning early.

We're going to championships soon (mandatory reference to being proud) and then we will be returning home to continue to defend the robot nation.  My life is not perfect, but I am a mentor and a Defender, and for that I am thankful.

This email doesn't have a particularly satisfying ending because I am constantly waiting to see what we will do next!

Drop me a line,

April 2016,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/04/03/the-power-of-uncertainty/,"April 2016, 03",The power of uncertainty,"“I think it is much more interesting to live with uncertainty than to live with answers that might be wrong.”

That’s Richard Feynman – a Nobel prize winning theoretical physicist speaking on the virtues of uncertainty.

I’m studying to work in the field of political data – a field that relies on massive datasets, and as with most sciences, has little room for chance and uncertainty.

I want to tell you two stories, both of which took place in 2014, and proved to me that being uncertain about something has the power to transform lives in ways that being absolutely sure of something simply cannot.

I began my college experience at Ithaca College in New York. I was majoring in communications and technology, and I thought my life was going down a certain path. After a semester at Ithaca, I arrived home and proudly announced that I was sure I would transfer to American University in Washington, D.C.

I had visited American during high school, and was pretty sure I would like it. It was a good, safe choice.

So I planned to apply there. Now, I had two friends from high school convince me, on a whim, to apply to George Washington University, also in Washington D.C. Now GWU, was a bit of a reach, and a very different setting that I was used to, but I applied.

When I went back to Ithaca in January, I focused my efforts on applying to transfer to those two schools. A few months later, I went into a meeting with an advisor and was confronted with a logistical problem: I had to withdraw from Ithaca before I would hear from the schools I hoped to transfer to. Now, it would have been a lot easier to just stay at Ithaca. I had made more friends during my second semester, and would have probably been happy if I had simply stayed there. Conversely, I had the potential to be a lot happier if I withdrew, and begun my sophomore year at another college.

My advisor asked me to make this decision and gave me little time to respond. I took the leap. I could have taken the safe option, but I chose to go with the option that excited and scared me.

---

On June 14th 2014, I got into GWU, and couldn’t have been happier. I didn’t know what would happen to me once I started school. Transferring asked more questions about my life than it answered.

The most important of these soon became clear: whom would I be living with starting in late August?

It was random, uncertain, completely out of my hands. I had to just wait and see.When I arrived at my new school I was skeptical, shy, and unsure of how to move forward. At first, I wished I could either live alone, or perhaps with one of the early friends I made.

I couldn’t have been more wrong.

The genius of the random roommate assignment was astounding to say the least. I’d been forced out of my comfort zone, and to live with someone who I didn’t necessarily want to live with. Thank God I realized how lucky I was before it was too late. Because of who I lived with, I’ve been opened up to an inconceivable wealth of friends and experiences. The unpredictability of living where I did has improved my life more than anything I can think of, and I’m incredibly grateful to my former roommate, whom I now consider among my best friends.

I simply cannot imagine what my life would be like had I not trusted the uncertain.

Please, reach out to me if you want to talk about randomness, statistics, or any of the other paradoxical concepts that make up our lives.

April 2016,02,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/04/02/the-immigrants-cookbook/,"April 2016, 02",The Immigrants’ Cookbook,"I love food. I love everything about it. I love planning meals, shopping for ingredients, growing vegetables, searching for recipes, pottering around the kitchen, cooking, baking, eating, experimenting, reading, watching, sharing... I love it all.

Until recently though, I didn’t really understand how important food is to me - and my life. To make a long story very short, last October I ended up in hospital literally unable to eat. Over the past six months I have learned a lot about my relationship with food – and its role in my immigrant identity. I am from Canada, but now live in the United Kingdom. While food has always played a big part in my life, it has become increasingly important since living away from family, friends, and the familiar. I use food as a connection to home. And I know that I am not alone in this.

As is typical with me, I arrived at this realisation by pouring my thoughts out onto Twitter. In the process, I said that I would love to write an immigrants’ cookbook: filled with the recipes that people turn to when they feel homesick, alongside their stories. Imagine having an entire book overflowing with foods that you know are a source of comfort. Recipes from all over the world, tastes that have travelled with people, stories that have been shared around new tables, all brought together in one place.

The next day when I woke up, I still wanted this book to exist. But I thought that maybe I should start small. Winning the Listserve has come at the perfect time, because I’m finally ready to do something with this idea. I now have a platform to contact people all over the world, to say:

We all have a go-to recipe when we need a food hug, whether we have moved across an ocean to a new country or simply over a set of hills to the next county.

If you have a recipe or story that you would like to share, please reply to this e-mail. It would be wonderful to know where you consider home, where you currently live, and in addition to your go-to recipe, a little bit about what it means to you.

I can’t promise that this will end in a book, but I do have plans to at the very least share these recipes and stories online (with permission).

If you’re curious, my own go-to comfort food (or at least the one that I go-to most frequently), is my mother’s Caesar salad recipe, which includes so much garlic that the next morning you wake up and are still reminded of home. I’ll give you a copy of the recipe, if you do reply.

If you’re not really into recipe sharing, but you’re still into food, here are some recommendations for a few TV programmes that I’ve been enjoying recently:

Heston’s Dinner in Space (Channel 4) is an extreme example of the idea at the heart of The Immigrants’ Cookbook, about the importance of having comfort foods when living aboard the International Space Station.

Cooked (Netflix) looks at the evolution and history of food, its preparation, and what it means to us, as humans.

Food Unwrapped (Channel 4) is a very entertaining and highly educational look into the global food industry and economy.

Oh, and Masterchef (BBC One) starts again this week. The good version too, with normal folk and not professionals or celebrities.

Thanks for reading. Happy eating,

A little about me: I'm 22. I'm Canadian. I have three awesome siblings. My family is extremely geeky, but me more than any of them. We are uncannily close. I am a fanatic about a bunch of nerdy things (Star Wars, Tolkien, Zelda, etc.) but I'm also pretty critical of geek culture.I work in a privately owned coffee shop every weekday and love my job. I get to hang out with the regulars most days and am rarely ever stressed at work. I went to school for 6 months to study computer science but had to drop out because I missed a month of classes while recovering from pancreatitis. I also have a weak pancreas, so I live with a very limited diet (I can't drink booze anymore, and have trouble processing dairy, soy, and sugar, including fructose).

I spend most of my free time designing or playing table top role playing games or video games (probably an equal amount of time playing and creating). In 2015 a team consisting of a few of my brothers and friends and I decided to seriously commit ourselves to trying to develop a video game. 2015 was the year that I got pancreatitis, quit school, moved, got my current job (along with three others), and entered the best romantic relationship of my life. I'm happier these days than I've ever been.

I've been reffing/hosting for the same group of RPGers  for a few hours every week for nearly seven years, and usually have one or two other games going at a time. I'm much newer to video game design, but almost equally as passionate now. My team is working on a game based largely on Super Metroid (although I like to think it'll have its own unique feel once we get it done).

I choose a ready guide in the celestial voice of Geddy Lee (and the celestial words of Neil Peart). Battlestar Galactica (2004), Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Adventure Time are my favourite shows. Grow Up and Blow Away is my favourite album (I like to listen to albums and playlists, not really into 'shuffle all'). I like a lot of kinds of music, but don't spend much time listening to mainstream pop.

I think a lot. I like talking to people. I like deconstructing things. I use a ton of “I” statements to communicate (because I believe that perspective is everything and that my view is probably really limited). I think that my thoughts and interests are very niche but I'm interested in how they relate to the big picture. I'm project oriented. Even friendships can be a little like projects to me because I love making to-do lists and doing the things on them. I love writing. I hope to write a novel some day when I am older and my friends are busier.

I'd be happy to connect with any of you. If you want to talk about RPGs, video games, movies/tv, music, books, societal trends, gender politics, other politics, religion, philosophy, ideas, topics, lists of topics, dull ironic meta humour, or anything else that comes to your/my mind I would love to hear from you.

March 2016,31,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/03/31/a-story-about-a-girl-called-amy-may/,"March 2016, 31",A story about a girl called Amy May,"I'm going to tell you a story, about a young woman named Amy May. You won't understand how important it is that you read her story, unless you actually read it. But it's a story that desperately needs to be known. 

If I could just show you a picture of her, you'd peer closer at your screen and you'd take notice. You'd ask me questions. You'd ask me ""why?"" and ""what happened?"". But now it's my responsibility to show you Amy through words. 

This is what happened.

In the autumn of 1987 a little girl was born an only child to doting parents. Amy May grew to become a kind-hearted young woman with a huge love of animals, a wicked sense of humour and the biggest belly laugh you'd ever hear. She went on to study Journalism at university, making many friends along the way, and began a successful career in London working behind the scenes in television - though she was so glamourous-looking you'd say she belonged in front of the cameras.

In April 2014, when Amy was 26, she went to Budapest for the weekend with some friends. One night they went out for dinner and she ordered Mediterranean chicken with rice. Doesn't sound that remarkable, right? However, taking just one bite of that dish completely devastated her life. Why? Her nut allergy wasn't taken seriously.

Don't get me wrong - no one took Amy's allergy more seriously than Amy. Everywhere she went she carried epi pens and medical cards in every language to show restaurant staff. Unfortunately this one waiter assured her that her food was completely nut-free, although it wasn't. Within minutes of eating a mouthful, Amy's throat quickly swelled up, despite her administering two epi pens. Her brain deprived of oxygen for six minutes, she went into cardiac arrest on the pavement outside the restaurant shortly after. What followed was a three-week induced coma to decrease brain swelling, months in an intensive care unit, countless infections, a collapsed lung and three bouts of septicaemia.

Almost two years later my beautiful friend is in a wheelchair, unable to walk or talk. She lives in a care home where she is fed through a tube and is unable to wash herself. 

That single bite of food caused Amy May to become severely brain damaged. And enclosed inside her helpless body with its fragile limbs and twisted hands is complete awareness. She remembers everything and understands exactly what has happened to her. After she woke up, it took around a year for her to stop crying every day.

Yet Amy's story hasn't ended yet - it's ongoing because she is one determined young lady. In 23 months she's gone from being virtually vegetative to laughing, swallowing, communicating and having a number of therapies to help get the old Amy back. I'm so proud of her.

Amy May Shead. To you, her name is unfamiliar - but to me and so many others it's a mantra of true bravery and resilience.

So, that's Amy May's story. Why it needs to be known is simple. People have to understand that allergies ARE serious. It's not always a fad. Flippancy could literally kill someone, or ruin their life as they know it. 

Please pass on the message.

It's fitting that I won the Listserve the day after I ran my first ever half marathon - training for next month's London Marathon, which I'm running for The Amy May Trust. Please do get in touch on email, Twitter or Instagram to find out more.

Are you an awkward conversationalist, or looking for more creative ways to “break the ice” when talking to a new person? A favorite pastime of mine is collecting and coming up with unique conversation starters. I think we can all agree that “What do you do for a living?/Do you have any pets?/Do you like TV???” is pretty played out, so feel free to whip out any of these gems the next time you’re searching for something to say (I’m including my answers just for fun):

-HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT RANCH DRESSING?My answer: I find that people either LOVE (or are borderline obsessed with) ranch, despise ranch, or are afraid to admit they like ranch, as it is a rather unclassy dressing. Whatever the answer is, I guarantee a passionate response and follow-up conversation. I’m a stereotypical, middle-class Midwesterner, so ranch and I have a healthy relationship.

-WOULD YOU RATHER TRAVEL BACK IN TIME, OR BRING SOMEONE FROM A DIFFERENT TIME TO NOW?My answer: I go back and forth on this one, but I think I’d like to bring someone cool from the past back (like Buster Keaton, Eleanor Roosevelt, etc.) so they could be my best friend.

-WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE ""COMFORT SNACK"" SOMEONE MIGHT CONSIDER WEIRD?My answer: Rye bread toast slathered in butter and grape jelly, with a side of room-temperature ketchup for dipping. The combination of the sweet jelly, rich butter, sour/savory bread, and tangy ketchup is divine.

-YOU'RE DYING OF A TERMINAL ILLNESS AND HAVE BEEN GRANTED A MAKE-A-WISH. WHAT WOULD YOUR WISH BE?My answer: I would want to go through my favorite art museum and touch any piece of art I wanted (under the supervision of a conservator and a curator, of course)! I’d wear gloves and be gentle.

-WHAT WAS THE FIRST CD / RECORD / 8-TRACK / CASSETTE / MP3 YOU BOUGHT WITH YOUR OWN MONEY?My answer: The Clueless soundtrack and that one Céline Dion album with My Heart Will Go On on it. I was seven, and a child of the 90's.

-WHAT IS A MOVIE THAT SHOULD BE A CULT CLASSIC, BUT SOMEHOW ISN'T?My answer: Antonia Bird’s Ravenous (1999). It’s a black comedy about Manifest Destiny and cannibals. It sounds like it should be a horrible movie (or a so bad/so good movie), but it’s actually a good movie. I don’t understand why it’s not the biggest deal. It’s on Netflix, so go watch it with your friends.

-WHAT WERE YOU LIKE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL?My answer: I have a theory that everyone’s embarrassing, middle school self is still buried inside them somewhere… I was a “middle school goth”. I wore a lot of black/safety pins, listened to nü metal, and was really into Sailor Moon.

-YOU'RE ON DEATH ROW. THE WARDEN ASKS YOU FOR YOUR FINAL MEAL REQUEST. WHAT IS YOUR FINAL MEAL?My answer: A corned beef sandwich on rye bread with mustard and pickles on the side.

Isn’t it appropriate that I chose to write about icebreakers for an email that’s getting sent out to ~22,000 people I don’t know? Drop me a line with your own favorite conversation starters, or if you think we’d be pals based on my answers above. :)

Now… go talk to somebody!

This old lady was as confident in this “5 Regret Rule” as she was drunk, so I’m assuming she’s operating on some kind of insider information and this rule is a real thing we all must follow. As I’ve gotten older, my list of regrets has morphed from things that were very specific (“I should have asked that girl out freshman year” or “I shouldn’t have gotten arrested those three times”) to a list of bigger picture regrets. Perhaps this is a sign that I’m growing up.

So, here is the list of five regrets as it currently stands for this nearly-grown-up 38 year-old Minnesotan with a positive attitude and a love of whiskey.

1.	I wasn’t very nice in high school.I wasn’t a bully or anything, but I was really concerned with being popular. This meant I was really only nice to the people that were “cool.” Ugh, this one is embarrassing for me think about.

2.	I did very little work/studying in college.Since then, Carol Dweck’s book “Mindset” has explained to me that I had a fixed mindset through college (and several years afterwards as well). This meant I would rather put in zero effort and get a 3.0 GPA than try really hard and risk not getting a 4.0 (and risk showing everyone that I wasn’t as smart as I wanted them to think I was).

3.	I never learned to sing and/or play an instrument. When I was in the fourth grade my music teacher told me I was a terrible singer. Sure, that was a crappy thing to do to a ten year-old, but I still shouldn’t have let it keep me from working hard at learning to be a marginal musician (another example of my fixed mindset). I really love listening to music, think how it would make me feel if I could make it. I guess the good news is that there’s still time to remedy this regret.

4.	I accomplished very little in my late 20s/early 30s. I had a job that paid enough to live comfortably while requiring less than 10 hours of work a week. That means I had 40,000 free-time hours to accomplish something and yet, I have very little to show for it. I could’ve at least volunteered at a homeless shelter or attempted the next great American novel. I’m not even sure what I did instead. Video games, maybe?

5.	I don’t enjoy being a dad as much as I want to. My kids are 4 and 2, and so far, it’s been like 97% logistics and 3% awesomeness. The tide is shifting every day (yesterday was like 70/30), so there’s hope for the future, but really, I wish I was one of those people who got real joy out of the little things their kids do (“she ate solid food for the first time!!!”).

I’d love to read your list of five regrets if you email them to me. Unless of course you put, “reading this boring list serve email” as one of your regrets.

Thanks for listening. Am excited to hear what you regret!

March 2016,28,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/03/28/the-pros-and-cons-of-being-an-empath/,"March 2016, 28",The Pros and Cons of Being an Empath.,"I didn’t know the word for what I was until a few years ago. My entire life, I wondered why I felt with more complexity than others. I tried to chalk my turbulence up to being moody, but it was more complicated than that. Eventually, I understood what I am and realized that being an empath is gift, that sometimes doubles as a burden.

On one hand, I have this kick-ass intuition (pro). I can read people and their emotions like a book. I can sense motivations (pro). This has helped me be good at my job. Flip side - it’s impossible to separate myself from the negativity of others. I can FEEL everything they FEEL (con). Depending on the person, this can leave me in a variety of states:

Example: At my grandfathers funeral I was fine, UNTIL I saw my grandmother crying.Example: When someone I love feels wronged, I get angry FOR them.Example: When I’m around people with bad vibes (you know the type), I walk on egg shells and CANNOT shake it until they are gone.

Television shows can also affect me in bizarrely intense ways. This severely limits my Netflix options (con, lol).

Example: I only watched 2 seasons of Sons of Anarchy. I gave up. The violence was too much.Example: I suffered through Making a Murderer. Watching Brendan Dassey on that couch, I BECAME him. I felt interrogated! I panicked when I couldn’t remember my alibi, (joke!) and started shaking before my boyfriend finally agreed to shut it off (not a joke, major con).

With crowds I can go one way or another.

Example: my boyfriend DJs for a well known hiphop artist. After shows, it takes me three days to recover. Not because I drank (I don’t drink) or because I stayed out late. It's because of the energy of the crowd. Everyone is searching for something so desperately... it’s as if they are not whole. They want to meet another person, be another person, take home another person, etc.

The collective missing pieces amongst 1,500 strangers empty me (con).

Example: I went to a John Legend concert and glowed for days. You don’t know what a room full of love is until you’re alongside 3,500 others singing “All of Me”. I still can feel it to this day. (pro).

That’s another thing that can go either way. Feeling things forever.

Example: As a kid, I hadn't quite learned how to control my super power yet so unfortunately, I was picked on. In 5th grade circumstances required that I transferred schools, which was exciting! Fresh slate!

September 1st, I showed up to make friends. Little did I know, “popular girl #1"" from my previous school, took dance classes with “popular girl #2” from my new school. Therefore, everyone knew who I was. because “popular girl #2” had mandated that no one come near me.

15 years later my best friend recalls this and laughs: “Yeah, that was so fucked up!” She giggles, but I don't. I feel that every day of my life (con).

Let’s end on high note though. Because being an empath is actually a good thing. Even though I have a such a hard time saying “no"" to people (con), it’s facilitated amazing relationships I don’t think I would’ve had otherwise (pro).

And as I learn to master this super power (and sometimes burden) that I seem to have, I learn new tricks to free myself: Mindfulness.

And love myself: Appreciation.

And be better for those around me: Gratitude.

Thanks for reading.

Up until about 20 minutes after the final dose, I had been sitting up with dim lights on reading a short story collection (Jeff VanderMeer - who, by the way, produces some truly surreal fiction that can be incredible to experience with disassociatives).Something struck me as funny and I put the book away. I started to think about the ""cosmic joke,"" which in my understanding is that we are each a living paradox, unable to comprehend the meaning of existence but capable of recognizing that fact. I then perceived a playful invisible presence in the room that seemed to be joyfully tickling my sense of irony and humor and pleasantly surprised that I was aware of it. I started to laugh and felt comforted and at peace.

At that point I turned off the lights, lay down, and put in my ear buds with Yo La Tengo's instrumental album ""Sounds of the Sounds of Science."" This synergized nicely and lulled me into a trance. I was starting to truly ""hole"" for the first time, feeling like I was sinking into a deep pit and no longer present in the here-and-now. Serious time dilation set in. At this point a grating track came on and I emerged long enough to switch to Mitski's ""Bury Me At Makeout Creek."" I started to experience massive waves of magnified emotional content from each lyric, phasing in and out between self-awareness and just *being* the music itself. The track ""I Don't Smoke"" came on, and when the following lyrics played:

""If you need to be mean be mean to me / I can take it and put it inside of me / if your hands need to break more than trinkets in your room / you can lean on my arm as you break my heart""

... I knew it was a/the deity speaking directly to me, offering to accept, validate, and transform every ounce of sorrow I have ever experienced. I turned off the music and was quiet for a little while, then I felt an incredibly massive wave of gratitude, acceptance, and worship. I am naturally skeptical and have been agnostic as long as I've been able to reason about it. It was like I suddenly became religious, like I experienced the exact inverse of my normal state - I knew and was embraced by a very specific embodiment of THE deity. I started sobbing and thanking god for revealing itself to me, for choosing to grant me a moment of relief from the uncertainty of seeking truth in this life.

I slowly re-connected with the present and time began to pass at a normal pace.

At the peak of this experience, I understood it to be completely real and factual. Three weeks later It's hard to know what to believe.

Well my darlings, I am suffering, and I need your help.I know you suffer, an I am here for you.

It's amazing how you can still draw a blank after all this thinking. 

I was born male, and now, as I look back, I see every event that's led up to where I am now, and I see every small, insignificant thing I missed. 

I was in a bad place for a long time quite some time ago, but now ever since i've really accepted the fact that i'm transgender, meaning I don't identify with the gender I was assigned with at birth, I feel like my life has been a lot better, even if by looking at me, you don't really outwardly see any difference. I'm pre-hormones, i'm really pre-everything besides a little bit of newfound confidence. I've been growing out my hair, i've been trying to look nicer, act like a better person, and I even came out to a few close friends about who I am. They accepted me for who I am, which went better than I ever could have imagined.

I don't know what i'm trying to tell you all with this message, but I suppose that it's a good thing to know who you are, and to, for the love of God, to not squander or repress that knowledge, but to embrace it.

My wife and I plan to move from paradise in wine country to somewhere near Albany New York to be closer to our respective families, particularly grandchildren. We’ve heard Lee Massachusetts is a great place to live but would like to know more good options. We’re looking for progressive political communities and a bit of culture. A few weeks ago on the Listserve, Ian Fox recommended the Web serial, Worm. Ever since I’ve been gobbling it up as a podcast and loving it.  The story quality and creativity are excellent and a small amount of copyediting will make it publishable and I hope very successful. Stories about superheroes and supervillains sound like comic book fodder. This work rises far above pulp quality to explore the human condition in a novel setting.

Some of my favorite things are gratitude, puns, cats, photography, Patrick Rothfuss (The Name of the Wind), The Firesign Theatre (I think We’re All Bozos on This Bus), Steven Wright, Robert A. Heinlein (Time Enough for Love), Patrick O’Brian (Master and Commander), Mark Twain, Peter F. Hamilton (Commonwealth Saga), Steve Gibson (GRC .com, Security Now!) and Terry Gross (Fresh Air).

According to John Pollack, author of The Pun Also Rises, puns are an essential chunk of human cognitive and creative processes from time immemorial. They show up throughout history, even in Egyptian hieroglyphs!

The Patrick O’Brian Aubrey/Maturin series is literature on a grand scale of 20 completed novels. Set in the Napoleonic wars, Jack Aubrey is a British fighting captain with most of the flaws you’d expect of a longtime sailor. His ship’s surgeon is Steven Maturin, a man of many surprises. I found the first two or three novels okay but not excellent. After that the author takes flight never falling into repetitive formulas exploring virtually the breadth of human experience, friendship, cunning, natural history, music, social contract, early medicine, science, geography, sailing and certainly war. For more depth in understanding, see a reference work called A Sea of Words by Dean King that translates non-English phrases and elaborates on locations, history and the close relationship between the historical novels and actual world and naval history.

Taxi driving is amazing. It’s a bit like reading a book by flipping twenty pages per second--I get short glimpses of many lives. I hear amazing stories from people in unusual circumstances, pass the time of day with friendly strangers, and sometimes can pass along useful information. Some folks want a little time to think quietly or nap while others want to celebrate and pursue sweethearts.

Vitamin D can save you from colds, cancer and improve your life in other ways. It is possible to get too much but it’s difficult! See grc .com/health/Vitamin-D.htm for much more information.

I have a close relative who suffers from anxiety and depression. Medications may have improved the symptoms but are far from giving relief. What’s worse is watching this person be slowly ostracized due to former friends not being comfortable around a depressed person. It’s been painful for me and worse for my relative. As this person says, if they had cancer, everyone would rally around and be supportive. Please hug a depressed person today.

First of all this is a glimpse at who I am:

Im Nour (that means light in arabic), I'm 19 and I live in Beirut Lebanon.Here are some random facts:  I speak English, Arabic, French and a bit of Spanish, I also did a few years of Latin in school but I couldn't remember a word of it to save my life.  I’m currently studying Computer Science which is something I’ve never thought I’d pick but I recently fell in love with it and I think everyone should try coding at least once. I also recently got into rugby, which is pretty cool especially since we’re one of the first girl teams in my country (yay!). Also, Im not sure why Im sharing this but, my favourite foods all start with a P and they’re peanut butter, popcorn, pickles and poutine.

Secondly here are a few lists of things I’d like you guys to check out.:

    4 movies I think everyone should watch:

Enter the void by Gaspard Noe (Warning: Its a bit disturbing)Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain - Jean-Pierre Jeunet (The soundtrack is just breath taking, its by Yann Tiersen and you should totally check it out.)Harvie Krumpet - Adam ElliotWest Beirut- Ziad DoueiriGood Bye, Lenin! - Woflgang Becker(Also has a soundtrack by Yann Tiersen)

    4 Songs I absolutely adore:

Old Stars - Jack The RipperCigarettes and Chocolate Milk- Rufus WainwrightShim El Yasmine - Mashrou’ Leila (They’re a great Lebanese band)Misery - Green Day (fun fact I used to be obsessed with them in my early teens)

    4 Books that are a great read

Le Petit Prince by Antoine de Saint-ExupéryPersepolis by Marjane Satrapi (Graphic Novel)Flowers in the Attic by V.C Andrews (Warning: F*cked up.)The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon.

Also, if you speak french, I totally recommend Les Fleurs du Mal by Charles Baudelaire.

Finally, here are a few questions I’d like to ask you guys:

1- If you could go anywhere in the world where would it be?2- Why did you pick the job/major you're in (or hoping to get into)?3- Whats a movie/book/song I should check out.4- Whats a story you like sharing with people?

PS: I’m going to India this summer and I was wondering if you guys have any tips or ideas on what I should do while I'm there?PPS: I’ve you’re ever planning on coming to Lebanon (which you should!) don't hesitate to hit me up for ideas on what to do here."
March 2016,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/03/22/a-love-letter-to-the-underground/,"March 2016, 22",a love letter to the underground,"I got the email that I was selected on World Poetry Day, so I wanted to start off by sharing my very favorite poem.

Even after all this time, the sun never says to the earth, ""you owe me.""Look what happens with a love like that;It lights the whole sky.

- Hafiz

I spend most of my days trying to emulate the sun. In this world of pain, cruelty, and hate, I'm trying to do my part to envision, and create, a world where we're each a little less guarded and a little more loving.

My favorite thing about living in DC is my dance fitness class, Kazaxe, which quite literally means House of Positive Vibes, and we lovingly refer to it as the underground. It's a high-energy fitness class with loud music and a lot of booty shaking, but the moves aren't what matter - it's the people. I've found a community of people who want to put more love and positive energy out into the world, who support and lift each other up by cheering each other on and motivating each other to work hard.  I could write pages about how the underground has changed me but y'all would probably get bored, so I'll stop here by noting that I've never been in a community more accepting of body types, gender, race, age, or any other identity. Most of us don't even know each other's names, but there's a love and connection that I've only found in this one magical place.

I hope all of you get to find a place like that someday.

Love to you all,

March 2016,21,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/03/21/free-beer/,"March 2016, 21",Free Beer!,"Well, now that I've got your attention...My friend and I like to create fake characters in our video games and mess around. Our favorite character is a striker for DC United in FIFA named Dicky Priest. Dicky is well over 6 feet tall and sports a look of perpetual wonder, along with a green afro. Dicky is a dumb idiot who runs around the field with a big green blob on his head and makes us all laugh. One time, he got his head stuck in the net after a goal, somehow.

As stupid as it sounds (and is), Dicky has gotten me through a lot of tough times in college. Whenever I'm feeling stressed, I start up a game of FIFA and just wait for Dicky to do something ridiculous. I don't tell most of my friends about this, because I don't want them to think I'm a lunatic with imaginary FIFA friends. But, seriously, this big dumb idiot has made me laugh during some of my roughest moments in college and I can't discount that.

Never take yourself so seriously that you can't laugh at a fake soccer player with a giant green afro. Student body elections just happened at my college. My friend Varun and I ran a write-in campaign for ""Spicy Meme"" to win a seat on the student senate. It was stupid, undoubtedly, but it was one of the more fun things that I've done in college. During my junior year, I convinced my friend Aidan that people had confused his phone number with the number for Papa John's.

Finally, let's go Mets!

Your community survey responses + other Listservians,"This is the one who wrote to you on Feb 29th. I figure my chances of winning twice in three weeks are 1 in 1.6 million (lucky, I know; I applied for a UK visa today so here's hoping this continues...). I'm going to take this opportunity to share with you the data we got back from the survey in my first email, and to give those who did respond the chance to contribute something. Their thoughts are below.The question was simple: What percentage of your Facebook friends live further than a day-trip away? It's a question of where your social awareness lies.

Based on the respondents, if the Listserve was to be boiled down to a single person we would be a 34-year-old living 3475km (2159 miles) from where we grew up. For perspective, that's roughly Vancouver to Ottawa, London to Beirut or Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur. And over half of our Facebook community (55.84%) would live more than a day-trip distance away.

As more data arrived in these averages budged surprisingly little, so I think we have an accurate composite of who the Listserve serves. But, I figured our data would be skewed by those of us in our twenties who have recently moved for post-secondary. Turns out age is not remotely a factor in our distance from our friends or from home.

Age | Avg. friends too distant (%) | Avg. distance from hometown (miles)*18-25 | 60.04% | 270325-35 | 58.34% | 226035-60 | 65.80% | 236060+ | 29.49% | 559

The only dip occurs for those over 60, and I imagine that is not due to travel friends never made, but to travel friends made too long ago to reconnect.

So it isn't a generational divide. What does affect our community is how distant we are from our own hometown.

Distance from hometown (miles) | Avg. friends too distant (%)<500 | 32.05%500-1500 | 66.85%1500-4000 | 69.04%4000+ | 73.93%

I would say the jump from 1/3 to 2/3 reflects the new social circle we're forced to make once we live further than a day's travel from home. After which point it doesn't really matter how distant the city is.

Based on our respondents, each year spent living away from home expands our community by 4.81% in new, local connections.

So here's to making our home and community wherever it feels right, and to the many people who responded with their own story of struggling to stay home.

And now to share the soapbox!

Within a month, we found it; the perfect house (house #1). This house had everything that we wanted- updated bathrooms, master bedroom, and a good school district. We were told there was another offer on the house, and to submit a “best & final” offer. We submitted the offer, and got a call back saying our offer was not the high one, but they liked our steady jobs compared to the other buyers. This is when I first realized how insane buying a house truly is.

 We said no and moved on. We had been trying to see another house (house #2) on the other side of town- once before house #1, and two times after. It had gone under contract before we had put an offer on house #1, but came back on the market. We scheduled an appointment to see house #2, and on the way got a call that it was under contract again. Finally, our realtor reached out and we were able to tour the house. 5 bedrooms, 3 full bathrooms, an outdoor pool, and a beautiful kitchen. So we put in the offer on house #2, which was accepted.

 We had many inspections, as we had learned from friends the many things that can go wrong. We had a chimney inspection and a sewer inspection, in addition to the normal home inspection. It paid off to have the chimney inspection- there were problems with the mortar in between the chimney flue sections. We were quoted about $3500 to repair. The sellers wanted to get another bid, which was completely fine; they were quoted $3800 to repair. The sellers were still unhappy with this number, so they asked for a third quote, which came in at $2175.  This quote was from Ridgway Chimney Service here in NJ.

 There were a plethora of negative reviews online, but we reluctantly say yes. We figured that at least the job would be completed according to code. This is where the horror show begins. The morning of closing, I look out at the chimney and notice the moss was still on the chimney. It was supposed to be sealed- how could they seal over moss? We put in a call, and Alan Ridgway, the owner, was verbally abusive towards me. We get him to agree to come out, scrape off the moss, and reseal the chimney.

 We decided to close on the house, because it looks that all the other work is done (but how can you be sure?). After closing, we get our chimney re-inspected, utilizing the first company. I said something to the effect that we hadn’t been able to negotiate with the seller, so we wanted him to come back out and take a look. “What happened here? This chimney is in much worse shape than a month or so ago!” My heart sank. Ridgway Chimney Service had done $7000 worth of damage to our chimney, and we are unable to use it due to an incorrect liner not lifting enough smoke out. It wasn’t sealed around the liner they put in, either, so combustibles can get through the old terra cotta liner and light other building materials. The best part? Our contract wasn’t with Ridgway, so we can’t sue them. It will take $5000 to sue the seller for the $7000, as we’re out of the small claims court territory monetarily. So our house has an unworkable chimney, which will cost us out of pocket to repair.Thanks so much!

March 2016,15,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/03/15/the-dance-of-life/,"March 2016, 15",The Dance of Life,"From the moment we are born and to the day we take our first step, our life begins as a dance. The dance of life becomes composed of different tempos, steps, taps, and slides. Taking refuge within our mother’s womb, some may waltz out of their shell while others may gracefully polka their head out of slumber. As for myself, I would say as much that my entry was more of an offbeat glissade (Sorry mom). The first stage shone, Fahaheel, Kuwait City, a small Arab country on the Persian Gulf. My dance as a toddler began as a petite chassé, which lasted until early 2001. Despite my current age (19), I have some cherished memories of the days spent on that sandy and oh so dusty stage. Now, my parents at the time were hard workers, they would spend long hours trying to provide for two growing infants, myself and my older brother. This resulted in days spent with our nanny, and the occasional fox trot with our neighboring childhood friend. Dust storms were infrequent, but would make a slow coupé, engulfing the small Arabian city. The three of us would take refuge in our tiny and compact apartment complex, somewhere between the 4th or 7th floor. As the dust storm settles with its final pas, I would always be in awe when small patches of dust/sand lay on the floor, blending with the fractal designs of the carpeting. Such nostalgic memories are those I wish would never échappé from my mind.

As the early 2001’s approached, the adagio of my parent’s efforts brought my brother and me to a cold and distant stage known as Winnipeg, Manitoba. This decently sized Canadian city became a new haven for my family, a clean slate you could say. Transitioning into this new land was not an easy endeavor to say the least. It was an allegro of planning and consulting, but gladly there were warm and welcoming hearts. For quite some time my family took vacancy with some relatives, the four of us jam packed into a small bedroom upstairs in their humble abode. My parents took another dive, from a sudden brisé to a soft elevé, working two jobs was necessary in order to further support the family. They continued their graceful pirouette on a slippery and foreign dance floor, until a sanctuary of our own was obtainable. A dance floor just for the four of us, we took vacancy in a small, comfy ranch style home, located somewhere in Northwest Winnipeg. My brother and I were thankful for our parent’s efforts. A large portion of our youth was then spent in a wild swing, playing with the neighborhood kids until sun down. The time spent in this distant land slowly became not too far out of reach and we began to warm up to its unfamiliar touch. Great friends and memories were created.

Unfortunately, the joy was short lived and the grand battement of life has swung our family into yet another waltz. In the early years of 2004, our family moved yet again, to our third and final stop, Red Deer, Alberta. Again, we took vacancy in a ranch style home, with some friendly strangers renting the basement below us. My brother and I felt as if a part of ourselves were left behind, but we knew it was for the best.

Despite all that, my parents never once took a step offbeat. It’s time to relax and let us pursue the stage.

I say this to you fellow Listserve readers, don’t stop dancing.

I wished it happened ten years down the road instead, when I may be happier and struggling less. but life does not go the way we plan, and I am learning to be more thankful. so today, I get to share with you some of my writings. hello. and yes, I'm listening to Drake.-(many) people are willing to listen when you share what pains you. but they are often unable to help, and worse, they later forget you shared at all. why, then, become vulnerable? I struggled greatly with this for a while. but the closest explanation I’ve found so far is when I opened up to my friend gabby, she replied, “thank you for helping me love you better.”-at 6am, I stumbled into the bathroom, saw myself in the mirror, and thought of you. I’ve told you about my puffy eyes and how much I dread the morning-afters of crying myself to sleep, but you told me it was cute. it was a passing comment on your end but I took this to my heart, because no one has ever told me this about my biggest insecurity. and it surprised me that I remembered, that I thought of you at all in the wee hours of the morning, because I didn’t realize either I had taken this to my heart. so I sat in the corner of my cold kitchen floor and drank my breakfast smoothie, and wondered if I’ll be thinking of you on my mornings with swollen eyes from now on -- if small reminders like this will fade away on their own, or if they will be around forever, or if they’ll only sometimes come back to catch me off guard and bite me till it stings. we were strangers, then no longer, then are on our way of becoming strangers again. but parts of you are tucked away in random corners of my life, and they are here to stay.-I used to crave love, as well as the idea of being love. recently, I caught myself not thinking of love at all. this scares me.-I used to sneak out to the patio where you keep your cigarettesand cut them in half with scissors, hide the unopened packs, and flush them down the toilet.we learned in school today that smoking kills, I'd tell you, and you'd smile back.but sometimes when no one was home, I’d hold one between my lips, unlit,wondering what it’s like to be you, smoking alone till the wee hours of the morning.smell of musky fog, I learned from you;lingering bittersweet aftertaste, I’ve learned without youso this is what it’s like, to grow old, to become youit isn’t at all the same as what I had imaginedI have no idea if you still smokeI wonder if you still do-I’ve been thinking of what it might be like to no longer have my mother around. she’s been noticeably becoming forgetful and growing weak. we laugh about it, but in the silence that follows, we both think about how there isn’t much time left for us to spend together. I regret being too immature and not loving her enough for most of my life. for some reason I thought, between me growing up and my parents growing old, it will be a forever. I was wrong.

No man’s land of time - this phase of life when, perhaps, you become someone.

When your self-imagination fatigues from popping around, trying to be this, trying to be that. You sit down and gather all the cumulative lessons of experience, to find the one central thread that is worth the actual plunging.

Where was I 10 years ago ? A provincial high school student from France, cross-fertilised between the country-side traditional life-worlds of my family, and the transversal impatience of my global pop-curiosity. A few steps into an equally unpretentious undergrad programme, I realised the scale of redemption my adventure could ensure, if only I decided to look at life opportunities with ambition and confidence.

Propelled by an exchange programme in the USA (Truman State University, whoop whoop), I could spot my next target. In an early morning of August 2009, I found myself in the cramming hot dust of a strange city : New Delhi.

And here you go, a couple moons down the line : seven years in India. And I contemplate the road. A few degrees to foray into intuitively-picked disciplines. A bunch of lessons on local politics and education. The organic sprouting of a rewarding practice of photography. Maturation of my musical identity, not ready to come out yet. A couple professional attempts. And many ripples to this one epiphany: that without a solid and harmonious self-knowledge, even the grandest of ideas will fail to the ground, delusive.

Shake it all energetically, and let it rest for a while.

Writing - here is the condensed product of this adventure. You can now find me somewhere in the sub-continent, energised between the inspiring determination of my girlfriend, and the infinitely kind playfulness of our young cat, Pani Poori. Laying the grounds and bricks of that which I am now focused on leaving to the world : my oeuvre. Slowly, imperceptibly : one day at a time.

Imperceptible. And yet, in just 10 years, my worlds have crossed.

Let imagination feed ambition.

Where were you 10 years ago ?

To 17 years old: Grew up in a poor rural community but from a loving home and supportive mum (dad left when I was young).

17 years old: Left home and moved 12 hours drive away. Studied Business and history at uni, funded via building work and then setting up a juice delivery business.

18 years old: Seeing my little juice business thriving approached by a local entrepreneur. I closed juice, took a break from Uni and moved to China for six months to help set up manufacturing.

Had an extreme time. Parties, girls, drugs and made friends with some extremely wealthy Chinese – all the things a 18 year old dreams about. Also saw massive disparity in wealth.

I was raped.

19 - 20 years old: Went back to uni but by this point decided I hated business. Studied Politics and History and got politically active. Managed to condense my degree and graduated.

Decided I wanted to be a journalist. Applied for all the top schools in the country. Was rejected.

Did farming for 4 months to save money.

21 years old: Went to India and Nepal for a year volunteering. Ran an orphanage in Nepal for six months during Maoist civil war, worked on agriculture program in India for six months.

At one point I had to hide in a wardrobe while people chopped off the neighbours head on the front lawn.

Got back to my home country and applied for journalism school again. Was rejected again from all minus one school.

Also became vegan.

22 years old: Completed journalism school, won national student journalism award, and was awarded grant to travel to Burma to report on human rights abuses for 3 months.

Returned from Burma, couldn't get a job in journalism so worked in a hardware store for several months.

23 years old: Was awarded national prize for top junior community newspaper report. Moved to large national daily newspaper.

24 years old: Was awarded top political journalism prize.

Got sued by extremely wealthy person I wrote story about. Was in the right but newspaper decides to settle to save money.

I get frustrated and resign.

25 years old: I moved to a mining community and spend six months working 4 jobs to save as much money as possible.

I move to major city in Asia with girlfriend.

Stopped being Vegan.

26 – 28 years old: Decide to launch a business with little to no experience in industry or money.

I work 80 hours a week, take zero holidays and earn nothing for 2 years.

I propose to girlfriend.

29 years old: Marry girlfriend on the beach in South East Asia and business turns a corner.

30 years old: Business is thriving with 16 staff, launching another 2 offices and looking to reach $2m in revenue this year.

Wife gets pregnant and gives birth. My daughter is the most amazing thing ever.

Life is hard but it’s also absolutely amazing.

This snapshot misses the very essence of what makes it incredible and the friends and journeys along the way.

Take from it what you will but I have a few points:

- Don’t be afraid to change your life.- I work extremely hard but always love what I do, am positive, make friends, don’t burn bridges, don’t rely on luck, stand up for myself and try to be a good person.- Nice guys don’t finish last, pushovers finish last.- Call your mum at least once a week.

Before now, I treated school wrong. Sure, I managed good grades, but education was just a game. If I could get into a good college, I’d win. Outside of that, I indulged in short-term pleasures. It felt great – if I could do bare minimum, I could succeed. But here’s the problem. At the end of the day, I wouldn't be successful because I wouldn't add value to the world. It's dangerous to prioritize status over usefulness.

After some time working, I’m back in graduate school and everything is different. What changed? Is it desperation that “real life” starts in a year? Is it that my goals are clearer and I can put the petal to the metal? Maybe a bit of both.

Besides school’s readings and discussions I listen to podcasts, attend conferences, read articles, and try to talk to people. I just wish I could consume information faster, and that I could stop forgetting information so quickly. If only I had more hours in the day, and more energy to fend away the fatigue that quickly catches up to me each day.

I want to be useful. I wish I read more books when I was younger, and that I talked to more people. I wish I had today’s curiosity, and that it continues to grow.

Often I think of Neo from the Matrix, sitting in a chair downloading knowledge, and I’m envious of the future. For now, I'll have to stick to reading a lot and talking to a lot of people. I think it's that simple.

---------

I’m constantly searching for better ways to learn and for life-changing articles, podcasts, and books. Let me know how you budget your time with information sources or 1-2 of your favorite podcasts/books (and why!)

Stories are powerful ways to communicate, and I'm trying to improve. I struggle with an expressionless voice. I welcome your tips on how you work on your storytelling.

March 2016,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/03/08/just-break-up-already/,"March 2016, 08",Just break up already!,"“What am I allowed to expect?” This was the question I kept asking myself in the waning months of my previous relationship. We had been together for five years and appeared to be on the conveyor belt to matrimony. It was a foregone conclusion, despite our constant friction.

I’d been through many relationships before, so I knew that rough patches were transient. I was experienced enough to not fret at the first sign of trouble, and I was confident enough to help my partner through her feelings of doubt. Over time, we built a strong foundation for our relationship that helped us navigate the many, many obstacles that got in our way. On one hand, that sounds like an amazing bond, and I felt like I had found the secret to a lasting relationship.

But the obstacles weren’t external; they came from the friction of two incompatible people trying too hard to coalesce. After so many breaks and repairs, the relationship started to resemble a hobo’s suitcase. We patched it up with tape and scraps, but it kept falling apart on an almost-daily basis. Eventually, what had been a source of pride - our ability to stick together through shitty times - began to feel like a burden. I started paying attention to all the little problems, keeping track of the big ones, and asking myself over and over: “What am I allowed to expect?”

Pop culture will give you the impression that the average relationship is fairly rocky. Usually hinged together by some form of pride or momentum, two distinctly different individuals grapple with each other in a subdued, drawn-out battle to see who will give up first. They sabotage each other's futures through compromise and obligation, remain bitter the entire time, and cling desperately to their memories of the beginning when it was all sex and romance. This was supposedly what I could expect for myself.

Luckily, my relationship deteriorated to a point where I was confident that, no matter how little I was allowed to expect, I wasn’t getting half it. I broke up with her.

Upon this turn of fortune, I almost immediately found myself in another relationship. I really do mean “found myself” - neither of us expected it to happen - we were just having fun and we suddenly realized that things were working better than we ever could have imagined. This confounded us both because we simply didn’t think it was possible to be so congruous with another person this easily. But that’s when I finally had a good answer to my question.

What am I allowed to expect? A lot.

I used to say that that compatibility was overrated and adaptability was key to a lasting relationship, but I also felt lucky to be where I was and I didn’t realize that things could be better. My last girlfriend and I were not naturally compatible at all, but we made it work for a very long time because, despite our many differences, we romanticized the stubbornness of sticking together through all the rough spots. I thought that time and familiarity would erode our mismatched edges until we rested against each other like stones in a wall. What we experienced instead was a perpetual grind between two diamond-hard wills until we both were dust.

If you’re not getting what you need out of your relationship, do yourself and your partner a huge favor and just break up already. Culture your independence and wait for someone who brings out the you in you. The happiest moments of your life, happier than you ever thought you deserved, are waiting.

I was laying back in the hospital bed, with the belts hooked up watching the baby's heartbeat, when I happened to also check my email. Initially I was excited to learn that I had, after four years of faithful reading and wondering when it would be my turn to share something witty and engaging with 20,000 strangers, finally won the Listserve Lottery. But then the reality quickly set in; when birthing a child, there is neither time nor energy to focus on other aspects of oneself. All that exists are bodily sensations and wondering/worrying/hoping about the baby, the future, the birth, how everything is changing.

Which reminds me that this is just another example of choosing between doing what my daughter needs and what I want. I'd like to share something right now that causes you to feel something.  But I have to be flexible today; I have to get back rather quickly to paying attention to the labor. And that is just it;  Sometimes I just won't have control over what is happening in my body, my baby's body and life in general. So if the Listserve Gods have chosen this freaking weekend as my one opportunity to connect with 20,000 strangers, I'll wing it and address the contradictions in this situation directly, because that is what moms do. I'm not going to edit this or think it through too much. I'm willingly sharing the most personal moment in my life in a very public way. Isn't that what everyone yearns for anyway....for the most deep down, vulnerable feelings to be validated, heard and ok?

I need your help my fellow Listservians, to finish this Listserve entry. The blood is not flowing to my brain properly right now.  I've learned that people usually rise to the occasion (especially when you're pregnant)., I have a unique chance today to have 20,000 people welcome my baby to earth. Would you please join me in greeting this new life to this old planet?  If you respond, I promise to gather all the welcome notes into a little book to give to my daughter on her 18th birthday.  A simple ""hello"" is enough. But you can say whatever you feel moved to say.  I read all your stories; I'm aware that you all represent such a diverse range of lived experiences. What a gift!?!

We don't have a name for her yet. All you need to know is that she is so loved, so wanted by her mom and dad. And since I realize that her dad and I have brought her into a world that is often unfair, harsh and meaningless, it might be comforting and inspiring for her to have a place to go to remember that life can also be beautiful, hopeful and surprisingly random.

In my professional life as a child psychologist, I often meet children and adults who once were children, who wonder about their own worth and whether there is safety in seeking out relationships with others. My hope is that I can parent my biological child (as well as the children and inner children in my patients) to develop an internal compass to her value and to try at least sometimes to see the positive from her limited time here.

É algo incrível receber esse toque profundo de vida, essa força tão intensa de criação e saber que a vida está acontecendo, fluindo e se multiplicando como foi feita para ser. Tudo que conhecemos e desconhecemos diz respeito a isso: o mistério da vida. E ela está acontecendo em dobro em mim nesse exato momento.

Há algo de muito mágico em encontrar o sentido da vida, tanto na busca como na coragem para viver esse sentido quando o encontramos. O meu sentido descobri vivenciando a maternidade, amando profundamente minha família e me dedicando a ela. Espero que todos possam vivenciar ainda nessa vida a descoberta de seu sentido de viver.

March 2016,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/03/04/no-subject/,"March 2016, 04",[no subject],"I’m 52, and I’ve been blind all my life. I tell you my age, because, for me, as a blind person, my life has been divided in halves – the half before technology, and the half after.A few weeks back, I was waiting at a corner for a bus. I noticed what felt to me like a temporary sign affixed to the bus stop pole. I pulled out my iPhone. I use Voiceover on my phone, a built-in feature that speaks what’s on the screen and lets me manipulate it with different gestures.I open up an app, I choose the video mode. The app searches for text and reads it. “This stop closed, use north corner.”Technology has opened up the world for me. I read the papers, I do my shopping and banking and a myriad of other things online; on my phone I have a barcode reader, a color identifier, a light detector, and text recognition apps. There’s an app that will connect me with a sighted volunteer for those times when I just need someone who can see something for me. Most of all, it’s opened up the world of books, in ways that just weren’t possible 20 years ago.It’s happening like this for disabled people all over the world. People are taking hold of technology, and figuring out how to use it to do things. It’s the great disability hack, and it’s amazing.It’s also incredibly fragile. Regularly I visit websites where the designer has introduced features that don’t work with the screen reading software I rely on. I know of blind people who have gotten hired for jobs as the best candidate, only to find that the software required to do that job isn’t compatible with screen readers. Accessibility wasn’t considered when that company made its software purchases, and so, a portion of the population was locked out from those jobs.I just toured a beautiful new building with a great, trendy rooftop space. I noticed that there was a lip in the doorsill going out to the roof. Could a wheelchair get over that barrier? I wasn’t sure.Technology can expand our lives, or it can shut us out.If it’s going to be the first way, and not the second, it requires that we create a culture where accessibility is the norm.If you don’t know about them, google the principles of universal design. To me, they read like a soaring manifesto for diversity – designing a world that considers a breadth of human needs and gives dignity to our strengths.I was so psyched to win the listserve lottery. I love reading people’s stories and hearing what folks are passionate about.I figure this is my chance to speak up for accessibility.If you’re a web designer, follow the accessibility guidelines – make sure, among other things that you can interact with the site using just a keyboard. If you’re an app designer, make sure all graphics are labeled, and do an accessibility check.If you’re an architect, check out some of the incredibly beautiful new spaces that are being created to showcase the principles of universal design. If you’re a person with hiring authority at your company, please be open to candidates with disabilities, even if you can’t imagine how you would do the job with that disability.I love my life as a blind person. I love the ways in which the world continues to open up for people with disabilities. Most of all I love a world full of diversity and surprises. Thanks for being part of it!

March 2016,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/03/03/here-there-be-squirrels/,"March 2016, 03","Here, there be squirrels","I'd learned the trick from my cousin the day before. We were sitting on the playroom floor at my Granny's house; two parakeets chittering away behind us. I told her my family was going to Stanley Park the next day, and about how badly I wanted to feed the squirrels.

""I know how you can get them to come up to you"" she said, cracking gum.

""You take two coins - a nickel and a dime - and you click their sides together. Squirrels hear it and they think it sounds like nuts being cracked open. They'll come right up to you.""

She paused for emphasis. ""I bet you could pet them if you wanted.""

I WAS SO IN.

For the next eighteen hours, I never put down my change purse. I held it so tightly I wore little sequin indents into my sweaty kid palm. Its 15 cent contents were the key to making my nine-year-old squirrel-obsessed dreams come true. I would feed one, it would let me pet it, and then it would come home with me and we’d be best friends forever.

As far as kid plans went, it was pretty foolproof.

***

We arrived at the park the next morning, dew slick on the cold spring grass. I bounded out of the family station wagon with singular purpose.

""Heather, wait!"" my mom called from the lineup at the snack cart. ""You can't call them without the peanuts!""

I ignored her. We were finally here! AND HERE...THERE BE SQUIRRELS!

I pulled my nickel and dime out of my change purse and began gently clicking them together.

Within 20 seconds, my siren song had entranced four squirrels. They hopped over expectantly, noses twitching, eyes bright.

I remember thinking they were a lot bigger than I'd expected—more like small cats—and sleek and black instead of scruffy and brown. I remember starting to worry that perhaps the Wonderful World of Disney—the TV show I watched religiously every Sunday night at 6pm—had fudged the truth about how friendly and safe woodland creatures were. I remember my mother yelling ""Jesus Heather, stop!"" and I remember mentally agreeing with her and somehow not being able to relay that information to my still clicking hands.

The next part is a bit of a blur.

The way my mother tells it, one of the squirrels decided to claim the nuts I was clearly hiding and jumped on to my leg, clinging by its claws to my corduroy overalls. In an instant I transformed from a quiet, polite, slightly prissy little girl to a spittle-flecked maniac. As my legs and arms flailed, trying desperately to dislodge the squirrel, I began hurling out a heaving, obscene cloud of f-bombs and s-bangs so loud and so dense that some say it still hovers over Lost Lagoon on misty spring evenings.

***

Years later and decades older, I find myself back at Stanley Park on a bright, dewy spring day. Birds are chirruping happily, waves are lapping and squirrels are doing squirrelly things. As I walk up to a concession stand to buy coffee, I think briefly about trying my luck with them again.

""Beautiful day, isn't it?"" said the smiling gent behind the counter. ""Absolutely"" I reply.

He hands me the coffee, and plunks down my change on the metal napkin holder. It makes an all-too-familiar clink.

""Looks like you've made a friend already"" he quips.

I don't even need to turn around to know what's behind me. And I don't even realize it as the words start to pour out of me.

""Oh F---

I met a girl the first time I fell in love with her in the date mentioned on the title. We had chatted on IRC previously for a few months before we met. Everything was planned to the smallest detail. We finished at a beach that night, seducing each other, discovering “a little bit” of each other’s body.Two years after that date she broke up with me. What she called monotony I called it stability. I cried so much that day. First love, first disappointment. I am thankful of not living in a country where I could have got easily access to a gun and have finished with my life. Even though, I tried my best with other alternatives. I failed, obviously.After that date in 2003 we continued sporadically seeing each other. Sex was good, but hurtful. I joined to a gym and then to another one. It looked like if she somehow figured out where I was and she found me. The sweat made sex even hotter, but still hurtful.At the gym they started to offer free salsa lessons for the members. I knew that if there was a place where she couldn’t find me it was there. She hated dancing and thought that people who dance latino were kinda losers. Salsa was my shield. Against her.Years passed by and the “small” city where we lived made that I found her on the streets, sometimes when she was with her new partner, sometimes when I was with my new partner. A situation that killed me, day by day. Every time I intimated with a new girl, in the darkness of the room, I saw her (my ex).In the last year of my degree I decided to apply for an exchange program at another university, in another country. I didn’t have too much hope for this. Actually it was her dream to finish her degree somewhere else. I think I heard that she couldn’t manage to go to study abroad. I did. Not my dream.I finished in a country 4752 km from home. This country became my second shield, against her again. It was enough far away and too much cold for her. She won’t find me here. I hope. Although I sometimes want she finds me.I still live in this country far away from home. I found a job and stability. Still alone though. I am consistent with myself and it looked like if I had decided I could not love anybody else. I have imagined a heart broken in thousand of pieces unable to love authentically as it did. A zombie life.I have to confess that I sometimes search for her in Facebook, and I find her, always with the same old picture. I imagine myself sending her a message, or clicking on the button to become friend with her. Then I think twice and realized that, maybe, 13 years are too much time for a couple-break.No matter the distance or the time, I keep my love and her memory intact as the first day. It’s an absurd suffering, I know, but I might have learnt to enjoy my drama. Maybe it will happen like in the film the Notebook and time has booked us in the future, when we are old.“Nunca estarás tan lejos que mi amor no pueda alcanzarte.”Thanks for reading me.Peace and love.Johan Serendipity

February 2016,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/02/29/you-join-most-of-scotland/,"February 2016, 29",You join most of Scotland,"Well, at least the 2.4 million people I pestered in my dayjob as a mass email marketer. I was just the developer; sorry for the many reminders, but we were the cheapest deal in your area.

If the trade taught me anything, a long email is saved by its table of contents.

i. Urge to travelii. Urge to stayiii. Where's your community?iv. No really, tell me

i. As a Canadian with no particular ambition to email Scotland, or to rally 24,000 driven and articulate Listservers globally (although a good pocket of you are still Bay Area, don't think I haven't noticed), I can add these pleasures to the stack of unexpected memories that blew by in my first four years of travel.

I left home in 2012 on a train headed west, four days of numb legs watching snowy forests, moonscapes and eventually the Rockies. As we entered the foothills I noticed a twenty-something who never left his seat, neck cricked to the window. He was shabby, knew the staff and had packed all his own snacks. Travel had beaten its routine into him - and travel quickly ages - but he wanted to see the same route again and find more this time.

I still travel, but I'm no longer a permanent tourist. I willingly crossed the line into residence two years ago when I met Edinburgh and the people in it whom I hoped to keep.

ii. Then came the challenge of a visa to stay, where sponsorship was the only option, and I had no sponsor. As such, my rented apartment sits in a country where I am not currently allowed to work or reside.

It's a personal indignity and a small struggle for a person who can fight it and has the means and support to do so. As a suburban Canadian born on the lands my ancestors have tilled since they first portaged in, the top assumption in my easy life has been an unquestioned citizenship. These last few months have worn into me the experience of fighting to stay in a country which you want and where you are wanted, but where more bureaucracy is being hoisted each day to close you off. It is the same feeling as love, sent out, denied and returned. In both cases you feel a logical world would let you stay and benefit each other. But you are not integral, and their indifference sweeps you out with the tide.

So if there is one feeling worth sharing: please take a moment to consider how it is to be first-generation. Look up how your nation treats its new residents, and how those policies have changed over the decades.

iii. A close friend brought up the question today, of why grassroots movements of the past few years haven't seemed to have the staying power which they did in, say, the sixties. Quickly growing an opinion, I claimed our community - the people we care to continue knowing and supporting - isn't physically near us anymore.

ChaseSometimes, you just want something. You can't stop before you actually try to obtain it, if you fail then that's fine it didn't work. But, if you don't try, you sit and wonder what if... What if's are the worst! If you ever have a decision to make, ask yourself will I look back and think what if... if yes, then do it! Period. It might not be something you really want after all, or it could be everything you could ever have dreamt of. The risk is worth it. 

Morality Do something stupid, but not wrong. There is no reason to make anyone ever feel lesser, to ever treat someone as if they don't deserve something. Wronging someone may not haunt your conscience, but it might mess someone up completely. You will hurt people, you will get hurt... Just keep your intentions for what you were trying to do clean.  

InsecurityThe early days of my life of bullying shelled me to never let my guard down, or to always act confident. It fended them off. Personally, I don't believe there is much to be cocky about for me, but things you develop in childhood are just hard to drop. But, deep down I am just as insecure as everyone else. One of the biggest things I have learned, is that everyone is insecure about something. And, we pretty much build this life around overcoming these insecurities! Respect others, but also respect yourself to be flawed as a human.

Risks I live by a motto that I sometimes do not always believe in, but is my attitude towards life anyways: ""I am the happiest person I know."" Everything that has happened to me, made me who I am. I have regrets, big regrets. But, if I lived so safely that I never had to regret something... I believe that would have been my biggest regret ever. Risks, are never as terrible as you play them out in your head. Look up ""catastrophizing.""

ParentsMy parents are my everything. There is no greater motivation for me, than the two people who have sacrificed meals for me to be able to eat. Who have sacrificed there desires to help pay for college. Who have spoiled this kid, but taught him humility. Constantly, told me that life is not about winning, it's about learning. Life is a journey, not a destination. Make mistakes, laugh at them, don't make them twice. They call and ask ""Did you eat anything?"", never ""Hey, how are your grades? Are you doing bad things?"" Parents are the single most taken for granted things in the world. Blessed to have the ones I have. Give your parents a call today, they miss you. 

Take leaps, I don't mean steps. I mean leaps! You will surprise yourself of what you are capable of. 

I love hearing the stories of people's journeys. Also, love entrepreneurship and would love to talk about it with anyone, from any perspective. Giving and Receiving advice. Feel free to contact me whenever. 

Also, shout out to caffeine.

February 2016,27,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/02/27/been-here-before/,"February 2016, 27",Been here before?,"Do you ever get the strange feeling of another life,  just out of reach? A vague memory or nostalgia for a place you've never been?

Sometimes, the scene that lies before me does something to me that I don't understand.

It doesn't have to be anything special, maybe just the way a street looks, the path to a front door, a tree next to a wall. Out of the ordinary,  something grabs me and I feel a strong sense of a place half-remembered, of deep emotional connections and associations.

But I am quite sure I have never visited these places. The memory tails off, I can't find the source. It is the intensity of visiting a childhood home, but realising you have never actually been there.

Sometimes I can pin down the feeling, follow it down the rabbit hole, finding illustrations, movies and music that hit the same spot, enriching and giving shape to the elusive concept. Not quite memory, thought or feeling, but something in between.

I try to be a rational person. I don't believe in past lives, spirits or the supernatural, which makes this phenomenon all the more interesting.

Is it just cultural association? Long-buried fragments of picture books from childhood or barely-registered movie scenes? A collage of media and memory?

What intrigues me most is the specificity. I can't predict the triggers. There are no reliable rules.

What is it about an ordinary scene that can make me feel like, if only I focused hard enough, I could enter another life, another world. A house on a hill that says, you know this place, all you have to do is walk in, and you walk out of your old life.

What do you think?

I was 17 in August of 2007, and I was in New York City seeing the musical Jersey Boys.  He was there, and I found out.  And I had to meet him.

Bruce was, and still is, my hero.  When I found out he was there, I was so overwhelmed that I started crying and couldn't stop.  My friend Danielle joked about finding me a paper bag, and my mom wondered aloud, “What do I do if she faints!?”  It was a real possibility considering I was crying just from being in the same ROOM as Bruce Springsteen.  Screw Jersey Boys!  I had to meet MY Jersey boy.

After crying through the whole first act, I pushed my way through the crowd and met Bruce during intermission.  I could barely eke out the words “I love you” as we shook hands and locked eyes.  Then I cried more.

As the show ended (I also cried through the whole second act), we saw an usher go to the front and escort Bruce and his guests out.  My mom whispered, “Amy, follow him out.”  So I did.  As he got into his black Escalade, surrounded by the frenzy of Times Square and camera flashes, he blew me a kiss.

And, you guessed it, I cried.

I cried from 7:30PM until after 2AM.

When I don’t know how to react, I cry.  And I couldn't figure out how to react, so I kept crying.  I eventually managed to pen a song about it later that night.

I can't tell you anything else about that trip to New York other than it was hot, I met Bruce Springsteen, and that meeting him remains one of my favorite moments in my life.

At that point, I hadn't seen Bruce play live yet.  But even now, having seen him seven or eight times, I still cry when he starts playing.

Although Bruce isn't the original reason why I started playing and writing music, he's a big part of why I keep doing it.  He's unparalleled in his ability as a communicator and in his bond with his fans.  He's given me, and so many others, incredible experiences.  If I get even marginally close to that, I'll die happy.

Here's a verse from that song I wrote almost nine years ago:

I looked my hero in the eyesAnd he stared straight back at meI knew if I didn't surrenderIt would end in a catastrophe

I wanted this to be a quick story, but how could I be quick with something so important!?  If anyone here has any connection to Bruce, please tell him Amy Mantis says thank you and that he (and you!) can listen to her songs at amymantis dot com.

Thank you, Listserve, for this opportunity.  I love this community.

Keep fighting the good fight.

Cheers,Amy

In that moment, I felt so full and round. Moments like that come and go. They will always be coming and going; there is not stasis, which is a little freaky.  But because those moments of happiness can be so quiet and still, I want to recognize them when they are here. I want to see the good when it comes and know the bad will pass when it seems like it won’t.

As fleeting as those moments of happiness can be, I think they have such a profound power. When you enter a room and allow yourself to find happiness, you are changing who that room is constructed for. As more time passes, the more I realize how certain spaces aren’t meant for certain people. It seems undeniable to me that comfort exists in abundance for certain people while others are forced to subsist on meager scraps which they fight their whole life for. But, through the sheer power of a person’s pleasure, spaces are forced to open up.

""Spaces are claimed through enjoyment, an enjoyment that is returned by being witnessed by others."" - Sara Ahmed

""Pleasure is expansive: 'We fill our bodies with what they lack, open up to the stream of the world, reach out to others' (Leder 1990:75)"".- Sara Ahmed

I believe that self-care and happiness are some of the most radical things that a person can practice and I hope that everyone finds moments when they feel so full that time seems to stop.

They were given this name for their logical and practical manner, specifically as it related to their decision to abandon Earth. They dubbed the majority of humanity as an “unsalvageable barbarian horde[1],” and left the planet to the people who had essentially taken over, hereafter known as the Barbarians.            However, let us turn our gaze to the time before the horde became what it was. In the early 21st century, the beginnings of barbarianism were only just coming to light. Many people were still unaffected by fear, capable of seeing beyond stereotypes or gross generalizations. Yes, politicians were beginning to discover that fear was a powerful motivator, but those who saw the faults in following this path remained in the majority. Evidence has been found to suggest that people would rather “leave the country” than live in a world run by these politicians (see Chapter 2 on The American Conspiracy). Of course, the Pragmatists ended up taking this one step further.            Before the Barbarians broke the Earthbound internet[2], we managed to save certain chronicles from this time period. The Listserve was recovered by Ingrid Bissen, 24 years Post Departure (PD) in 2171. It is perhaps the best record of pre-Barbarian humanity we were able to retain. The Listserve is a collection of electronic missives between strangers from across the globe. It’s said that the list of subscribers was made up of some twenty thousand souls.            Let us pause to ponder this scenario for a moment. On a day picked at random, one of those people would be given the opportunity to amplify their voice. That anyone would choose to listen is a different question. But imagine being in that situation. What would you write? Would you use this opportunity to promote your business? Share your greatest moments? Condemn your enemies?            Remarkably, most people used this chance to share advice, motivation, inspiration. Their stories were remarkably like ours. A mother struggling to find herself within the new role of motherhood. A man afraid of being judged, hiding who he is. A child coming to grips with what it means to be an adult. And throughout it all, there is an undercurrent of understanding—empathy of the human experience—that the Barbarians could never achieve.            The Listserve is a powerful historical artifact. It shows us the glory of what once was and the tragedy of what we have lost. But it also begs the question—if a society made up of minds such as these could devolve into the Barbarian Horde, what, if anything, can stop it from happening on the Moon?

Make a list of everything that’s brilliant, try not to add things that are materialistic, but try to add at least one thing everyday. For instance, my list includes: Jim Dale’s voice when he reads Harry Potter and the fact that the unicorn is the national animal of Scotland (seriously, you can look this up.)

2. Take a philosophy class. I took a class called Ethics and the Rwandan Genocide at summer camp (shout out to any Med-o-larkers that read this list). Taking a class on ethics was one of the most interesting things I have ever done.

3. Listen to as much music as possible. Don’t limit yourself to what’s on the top 40s, or just generally on the radio. Personally my two favorite bands are Coheed & Cambria (shout out to any children of the fence reading this list) and Delta Rae. Now these bands are polar opposites on the music spectrum, but both groups are incredible.

4. Find a favorite stand-up comedian, there’s nothing better than a good laugh. My favorite is Scottish Comedian, Daniel Sloss.

5. Find and listen to a really good podcast. Now I know most people are busy talking about Serial right now, but I really like comedy podcasts (especially at the gym). My current favorites include The Carl Donnelly and Chris Martin Comedy Podcast and Anna Faris is Unqualified.

6. Learn everything you can about one thing that most people wouldn’t know much about. For instance I have a weird encyclopedic knowledge about the musical RENT.

7. Do something that will give you an adrenaline rush. It could be something that just really excites you, or it could be the thing that terrifies you most. Personally, my favorite rush comes from getting onstage and singing with my band.

8. Travel. I know this one is on almost everyone’s list, but that’s just because the world is an amazing place, and everyone should try and experience it.

9. Reach out to a stranger, be it at a coffee shop or even on Tinder. You never know who you could meet and what kind of conversation you could end up having!

10. Lastly, just be nice. It’s such a simple principle, and yet it seems to be one of the hardest things to do. Just smile when you walk down the street, or hold the door, sometimes it’s the simplest thing that can turn someone’s day around.

I’d love to hear what you find, and I’d be happy to be the stranger you reach out to!

On Wednesday I drove myself 2 hours from home, to stay in a hotel for a week, away from my cats and my love and everything I know. I've been put up by the corporate restaurant I work for, with some others (some I know, some I don't), to help train their new team at a new restaurant. It's nice to have a company that wants to build a community.

As a someone who is incredibly introverted, this has been a nerve wracking experience for me. I'm very much out of my comfort zone this week, but at the same time I'm so unbelievably comfortable. That's how I know hospitality is where I belong. Because even after the 12 hour days, pumping out $15,000 worth of product every.single.day over this EXTRA long weekend... Of course I'm exhausted but I also feel so accomplished. 

Today is Sunday. I've got two more days and then I get to head home. One more hard push to get us through the holiday Monday and we'll cruise into the rest of the week. I tell you, I've loved this experience but I am ready to sleep in my own bed, with my loves arms around me and the cats at my feet. 

I'm determined to make the most of what I've learned though. The past year I've been suffering from twenty-something troubles... A lack of direction of you will. But this week feels like a turning point.

I think I finally have a goal. Even if I can't quite put it into words yet.

February 2016,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/02/18/six-words-to-live-by/,"February 2016, 18",Six words to live by,"Twenty-five of us gathered as strangers with secrets to share.

John Rubadeau, an English professor at the University of Michigan, implored us to make the private public. He did so by asking each of us to pen a short essay, an essay in which we’d share our secrets.

I learned of the moment Randy’s life had turned upside down and that Kyle actually met her boyfriend on jDate, along with 22 other closely-held secrets..

For each 3-page essay we read, John expected every us to write six pages of feedback. My final essay was three pages, and I received 144 pages of critique. John called this quid pro quo.

Our commitment to improving each other’s work paid huge dividends; individual students couldn’t become better writers, the entire class had to improve as a unit.

By the semester’s end, John had transformed this group of strangers into a family. In three pages, I learned more from my classmates than I had learned from many of my friends.

After graduating from college, I took my fondness for entrepreneurship, startups, and design thinking and turned it into a career. Though my work is fulfilling, I’ve found it difficult to practice quid pro quo in the tech industry.

I’ve had one true quid pro quo moment in my adult life. My mother was diagnosed with leukemia in 2011, and I was asked to donate my stem cells to her. It was an obvious decision––one that any child would make. She lived, and I am thankful for modern medicine each and every day.

Then, three months ago, I received a call from Be the Match; a 62-year old male with blood cancer needed a stem cell transplant and now I’m donating stem cells a second time. I’ll be physically uncomfortable for a week, but I’m ecstatic because I have the opportunity to extend this man’s life.

It’s exceedingly rare for someone to donate stem cells twice, and donating stem cells is easily the most selfless, generous thing I’ve ever done. As I’ve prepared for this second stem cell experience, I’ve realized that I need to be more generous in my daily life.

Which brings me to John’s second piece of advice: scratch your itch. Being kind––to myself and to others––has become an itch that I need to scratch.

I want to help myself, and others, be more generous in their daily life. I dream of taking John’s advice into the virtual world––a community where people challenge each other to live a more fulfilled and selfless life.

Imagine if, every day, you received a prompt that would help you live a more balanced, mindful, and generous life. With these prompts, you’d get exposure to new perspectives and you’d push the limits of your comfort zone. Each prompt would be written by a member of the community; you’d be able to track your own progress, and see how many others participated in the daily quid pro quo prompt.

Examples of daily prompts:Generosity: Buy a stranger coffee, with no strings attachedRelax: Walk a mile without pulling out your phone. Listen and observeBury the hatchet: Apologize for something you’ve regretted for a long time

If you’re interested in practicing quid pro quo on a daily basis, send a prompt idea to  I’ll start sending you prompts to live a more mindful, generous life and you’ll be helping me scratch an itch of my own.

Whatever you do, remember these six words to live a better life and have a more fulfilling career: quid pro quo & scratch your itch.

Pilots are great, they are skilled, intelligent people who do a great job flying but! For every pilot, there are a dozen mechanics keeping those planes safely flying.

I am an FAA certificated Airframe & Powerplant mechanic. That's a fancy way of saying I fix planes! We are called A&P mechanics, or just A&Ps. There are thousands of us (hundred thousands? I'm not exactly sure). We work for airlines, corporate aircraft owners, little shops that maintain private planes and big repair and overhaul facilities. We are why you can fly without fear. I've torn apart giant Boeings and Airbuses, fixed any issues and put them back together. It's all heavily regulated, the paperwork is precise and the skill and passion of the mechanics is unmatched. Most of us are prior military, many are not, but we all share a deep love of, and respect for aviation.

Mechanical failure is one of the LEAST common causes of aircraft accidents and incidents, and we are dang proud of that! So even though pilots get the glory, and people are annoyed when a flight is delayed, and roll their eyes at the mechanic they see come on the plane to fix the problem, remember...we keep you safe!

February 2016,14,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/02/14/i-still-cry/,"February 2016, 14",I still cry,"I still vividly remember a moment when I was contemplating having kids, and a well-meaning male friend said to me: When you are a mom, you are always guilty. He went on, ""If you work outside the house, you feel guilty about leaving your kids with someone else, and if you stay at home, you feel guilty about not leveraging your education and experience and thus not contributing to the household income.""

I didn’t agree and found this theory disempowering. However, I didn’t have kids then so couldn’t speak from experience.

Today, I do have a 17-month-old son and I think a lot about guilt and motherhood.

Now, I believe it is deeply problematic for our ourselves, our families, our professions and society at large, if we as mothers live in chronic guilt.

Yes, the choices we have to make, and the tradeoffs we balance, are incredibly hard. I haven’t figured it all out yet and often wish parts of my life were different or that I had made a few different choices around work earlier in my career. But for the most part I am content. The truth is that the word guilt doesn’t exist in my vocabulary.

I don’t chronically worry that my working outside the home will harm my child. I don't fret that he is harmed by having parents with professional lives outside the home. Nor do I experience deep anguish that I'm doing something wrong by working. I'm largely content.

And yet, I still cry.

I cry because when I am at work, I miss being with my son Vivaan. Every time, I see a baby or a toddler in my office café, I secretly wish that I was having lunch with my little munchkin, holding him one more time, giving him another hug. I miss spending more time with him at the sandbox. My heart yearns for more time at the playground and tears trickle down my cheeks. As much as I appreciate the peace and quiet after bedtime on a Sunday evening, I also fondly cherish the wonderful time on the weekend and know that Monday will not be like Sunday.

I am blessed to be working for an incredibly supportive manager at an organization that understands the needs of families. My husband is an amazing father doing his share to raise our son. We both chose our jobs consciously in order to integrate our professional lives with our lives at home. When I look at our family life in chunks of weeks, I feel content.

But, I still cry.

I make peace by reminding myself how blessed I am to have someone in my life I can love so dearly that even when I am three miles away from him and see him everyday, sleep next to this little being, I miss him so dearly. No matter how many hours I have, my heart wants more. It is a struggle between being content with what I have and constantly feeling like I wish I had a few more minutes with him.

I also make peace by reminding myself that I choose to work and refrain from using language that says but “I have to work.” Sure, I am a significant contributor to the income in our home but again, I am choosing financial security, intellectual stimulation and a career I care about. All of these are choices that come with consequences. There are millions of Americans, raising very happy, successful and resilient kids on one income or two part-time incomes. There are also millions of women, many with better educations and more career options than I, choosing to spend their time raising their families full-time. I have nothing but respect and admiration for them. But I know that we have found the right balance for our family.

I don’t know if the tears will ever stop. Part of me wishes that they do and I could spend every minute that I am not with Vivaan being fully present at the task in hand but part of me hopes that I always love my child and enjoy his presence enough that I miss him every time I am not with him.

My tears are not full of guilt, remorse or regret but with love—pure love, big love, mommy love.

Sending love to all the moms in the world who miss their children!

The Flash

It happened one day, at a crossroads, in the middle of a crowd, people coming and going. I stopped, blinked: suddently I understood nothing. Nothing, nothing about anything: I did not understand the reasons for things or for people, it was all senseless, absurd. I laughed. What I found strange at the time was that I had never realized before; that up until then I had accepted everything: traffic lights, cars, posters, uniforms, monuments, things completely detached from any sense of the world, accepted them as if there were some necessity, some chain of cause and effect that bound them together.Then my laugh died. I blushed, ashamed. I waved to get people's attention. ""Stop a moment!"" I shouted, ""there is something wrong! Everything is wrong! We are doing the absurdest things. This cannot be the right way. Where can it end?""People stopped around me, sized me up, curious. I stood there in the middle of them, waving my arms, desparate to explain myself, to have them share the flash of insight that had suddenly enlightened me: and I said nothing. I said nothing because the moment I had raised my arms and opened my mouth, my great revelation had been as it were swallowed up again and the words had come out any old how, on impulse.""So?"" people asked, ""what do you mean? Everything is in its place. All is as it should be. Everything is a result of something else. Everything fits in with everything else. We cannot see anything wrong or absurd.""I stood there, lost, because as I saw it now everything had fallen into place again and everything seemed normal, traffic lights, monuments, uniforms, towerblocks, tramlines, begggards, processions; yet this did not calm me, it tormented me.""I am sorry,"" I said. ""Perhaps it was I who was wrong. It seemd that way then. But everything is fine now. I am sorry."" And I made off amid their angry glares. Yet, even now, every time (and it is often) that I find I do not understand something, then, instincitively, I am filled with the hope that perhaps this will be my moment again, perhaps once again I shall understand nothing, I shall grasp the other knowledge, found and lost in an instant.-------------------

Growing up, I didn't comprehend for many years that we were poor.    Perhaps not until paying for reduced lunch in school did I understand our poverty.    Reduced lunch was a quarter instead of $1.50,  and it meant holding up the lunch line while some woman in a hair-net would ask my name, and then slowly check it off a list as if she hadn't seen me every day, or wasn't quite sure where W was in the alphabet.  I always felt this 'service' of reduced lunch was a conspiracy in public humiliation.     You couldn't make lunch for less than a quarter, not even in the 80s.  I stopped eating lunch in the 4th grade.  With poverty came the reality that, although the spiral perm that mom gave me in the kitchen wasn't noticeably a ""home perm"",  I still would never be cool because my hi-tops were not BK, LA-Gear, or Reebok, but shoes we got at the Champion discount outlet.  What we did have, my family as well as other fiscally challenged Americans,  was Government Cheese, glorious government cheese.  For those that didn't qualify to receive this delight, well I feel sorry for you.  I would gladly again entertain the idea of hotdog water as a soup base (my brother swears this happened; mom denies it)  if it allowed me to have another Gub'ment cheese sandwich to accompany that meal. Some Background:  Before we had socialized healthcare, we had Reagan's socialized cheese.   To standardize dairy prices the US Government had stockpiles of dairy surplus in the form of butter and processed cheesestuff.  The yellowy-orange American cheesefood product was mass produced and said to have contained a scrappy mixture of various different cheeses, emulsifiers, and preservatives.   In the 1980's stockpiles of dairy surplus got so large that the cheese supply was in danger of spoilage, so the Reagan administration decided to distribute free processed cheese to the nation's needy families.  Apparently the subsidy program that funded cheese and butter blocks ended in the 90's.  To tell you that government cheese was delicious would be an understatement.  As an adult, I've eaten at a number of renowned restaurants including the French Laundry where I dined on truffle mac and cheese made from the milk of a single cow and sprinkled with a trio of tasting salts from the time of the dinosaurs.   Thomas Keller's posh-mac was good, but if given the choice between pretentious macaroni or a plain-ass poverty sandwich, I'd take the nostalgia sandwich.  Most seem to agree that it was most like Colby.....which I'm not too sure about.  In many ways, I feel like this historical poverty symbol, government cheese, can easily stand as a metaphor for my tough childhood, scrappy, and uninviting to the onlookers, but rich and satisfying on the inside.   My single mom often worked 3 jobs, but we had a very good life. If anyone here on the listserv has any connections to what was then this USDA cheesestuff, I would gladly pay the black-market,  back-alley,  crack-den,  dark-web price to once again experience the power of Government Cheese.  Please contact me.

I've always found philosophy to be an captivating subject; on the surface it seems so simple and obvious, but something I never dare to uncover myself. One day, my professor was explaining this happiness theory to the class, about effort and how we divide it across our life. I unfortunately cannot remember the philosopher who came up with this, but go with me as I try to paraphrase it as best I can:

Your life is made up of cups of water. You ultimately have many cups to represent the many things in your life -- family, friends, social life, your respective work, sports, art, movies, health, etc. We only have an allotted amount of water we can fill these cups up with, and it is in our control which cups get more water than others. Now, if I was Pablo Picasso, my artist cup we be pretty full, and the other cups of my life would have minimal water compared to that cup. But let's say there's a person out there who's an artist, but also loves to make pasta, and they give equal time to each of those interests. It's fair to say that second artist will be a lesser artist than Pablo Picasso, since they're giving half the effort and time to being an artist. Again, we have many cups that make up or lives, but only so much water to put into each one of those cups.

Fast forward one year, to the present. I am graduated, and pursuing a career as a graphic designer. As I attempt to find jobs and internships, in the back of my mind I am always second guessing where my water is in my different cups. To be a great artist or graphic designer, I am going to have to put a lot of my water in that cup, which means taking water out of my other cups. I feel right now that my cup for my dead-end internship is getting more water than my cup of creating, learning, and bettering my art. And if I truly want to become a great and talented graphic designer, what cups am I going to lose along the way? And, will I be happy with all my cup in that one cup? Would I be happier pursuing many things that I enjoy? There are so many things in the world that I love and inspire me, it's saddening to thing I can't be well rounded and talented in all of them. It's a balancing act and a continuos assessment of yourself, and what you honestly need and want out of life.

I want to give a great shout from the Listserve rooftops to one of my best friends Ali, who introduced me to Listserve and is currently teaching in South Korea. Already one month down, and I hope you're rocking the neck out of those Pooka shells. Ali, along with my other friends on this Listserve, Meg, Kelly, and Maggie, are so inspiring to me in each of their own individual way. Cherish does not cover how much I value our friendship.

CHRISTMASES PAST

A collection of stories about Christmases past, which coincidentally tie together a number of things I’m passionate about.

2012 – Tokyo, Japan

An impulse decision – my first trip as a new ‘solo mum’ (hate that term!). I’d never travelled on my own, and now my 6 year old daughter and I were heading to a non-English speaking country where I knew nobody. I felt physically sick with worry that Christmas day as I boarded my flight.

In hindsight, Japan was amazing, we Couchsurfed and met wonderful people. Don’t ever believe you can’t travel with children. Since then we’ve both backpacked in Russia, Mongolia, Egypt, Kazakhstan and Chile (to name a few).

2013 – New Zealand

Started an 8 month relationship with a man who was emotionally abusive. Lesson: Value yourself, you are worth more than that, don’t put up with that shit. And call the police immediately if it ever gets physical. Don’t be embarrassed. Learn and move on.

2014 – Bethlehem, West Bank

The home of Christmas. We visited the Church of the Nativity and Manger Square, then spent the evening and Boxing Day with an amazing family full of love. They truly redefined for me what family was all about. We cooked and ate together, and their children and my daughter played and explored outside. It was a perfect couple of days.

Now … stop a moment and reflect on the picture you have built about that story. What does that family look like to you? In reality, we were in Bethlehem’s Aida Refugee Camp, and the family was Palestinian.

For many years my only knowledge of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict was what I heard in the media. Before we left I began researching and that - in conjunction with what I saw and heard in Israel and the West Bank - opened my eyes. If this email succeeds in only igniting your curiosity about the Palestinian side of the story, I’d be happy.

2015 – New Zealand

A Christmas without my daughter, and without my mother who died in 2015. I chose to spend most of the day volunteering at a community Christmas lunch. The experience allowed me to not only do something for others, which on its own is incredibly rewarding, but made me realise I how grateful I should be for what I have. Great life lessons.

CHRISTMAS YET TO COME

2016 – Cuba / Latin America

I’ll be travelling again; my study will be finished; I’ll be about to quit my job when I return to NZ and looking for a NGO, community work, or travel role (any offers of work Listserve people?); maybe there even might be a significant other. Who knows?

FAVOUR

My friend Eugene lives in NYC, and recently visited Iran. He has been inspired by the people he met and wants to establish a foundation for Iranian women to further their education at international universities. If you can help in any way (financial, advice, etc) please email.

TALKBACK

I love that Listserve is more than a one-way broadcast.  I’m a business analyst and used to asking questions, so it would be awesome to get feedback on the following or anything in this email that resonates.

- The best/worst Christmas you’ve ever had?- Any amazing travel destinations that may not be well-known?- The biggest risk you took in life? Did it pay off?- How to get a gift into Russia (for the man who saved my brother’s life). It was rejected by customs.- How to get paint splashes off my flatmate’s chair before he sees it?

February 2016,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/02/05/married-and-widowed-why-same-sex-marriage-is-important/,"February 2016, 05","Married and Widowed, why Same Sex Marriage is Important​","I met her in a small diner in Rawlins, WY, called Rose's Lariat.  She was riding her bicycle across the country, I was at my family's ranch, in town for groceries.  The minute I saw her, my mind said, ""Well, there she is"".  I figured out a way to let her know I was ""safe"", I asked her if she was riding her bike to the Michigan Women's Music Festival.  It was 1995.  Her name was Jan Lambertz.We stayed together from that moment on.  She moved to WY to be with me, after I tied her bike on the top of my car and dropped her off back on the trail, but not before asking her to marry me in Durango, CO.    Every day I was in town, as she rode, I traced her progress, and called the chamber of commerce to find out the motels that were in the towns where she was likely to be that night, then called each one and asked for her.  I managed to get her most nights.  After two weeks of this, she decided to take the train back to me.

We moved into a house in Laramie, WY, where I was a nursing student.  When she got a job we moved to upstate NY so she could take a position as the Director of Counseling at St. Lawrence University.  My children lived with us off and on during those three years.  ​ ​We attended the Unitarian Universalist Church and had a very close community.

Soon after we moved to NY, Jan​ began feeling unwell.  She was pale, had dark circles under her eyes, and had a general lack of stamina.  She had been the country's first female athletic director, at Evergreen State College, and was generally extremely healthy and fit.  Something wasn't right, but her doctor told her it was ""just perimenopause"" and that estrogen would cure it all.  She didn't believe him, and declined the estrogen, but kept going back with more and more complaints.  During that time, Jan and I restored a 105 year old Italianate Victorian home.  Jan had a full set of tools and had restored homes in the past.   She was quite a skilled carpenter.

Finally, reluctantly, she agreed to the estrogen, as a last ditch effort to feel better, and she had a mammogram to make sure it was safe.  They found cancer.  She had a mastectomy and all of her lymph nodes were full of two kinds of cancer.  They staged her at a stage IV, the most lethal stage, with metastasis.

We tried everything, including traveling outside of the country, to try to find a cure.  We cashed in her life insurance and paid for alternative treatments.

Meanwhile, we decided to go ahead the the wedding.  At that time, in NY, you couldn't get legally married if you were a same sex couple, but our UU ministers agreed to officiate.  We asked our friends to bring either food or flowers, and hired some local musicians to play.  We bought dresses and rings.  Each day she grew weaker, but woke up and asked ""When is the wedding?"".

The day before it was scheduled, she got very much sicker.  I could tell she was trying to hold on until the wedding, but she was fighting a losing battle.  Her breath came heavier, and she started to turn yellow, as her organs started to shut down.

By the evening, my father, who had come to town for the wedding and for my graduation from nursing school, suggested that she was trying to stay alive for the ceremony.  We decided to go ahead with it at home, and called the ministers, who came over.  Friends joined us at the bedside, we made bouquets with flowers people had sent, someone played ""Here Comes the Bride"" on the piano.  A friend made us a wedding cake.  Jan was not showing any signs of consciousness but we went on ahead.  The ministers read the ceremony, as planned, and I spoke my vows.  The ministers read her vows and asked her to blink if she said ""I do.""  She blinked hard.  Then, afterwards, when they said that we could kiss, she puckered up and gave me a HUGE kiss.  Everyone clapped and left the room.  Minutes later, after telling her how much I would always love and honor her, she breathed a HUGE sigh and stopped breathing.  I could no longer see her heart beating in her chest.  She was gone.  I was devastated.

The next day, the day of the wedding, I put a sign on the UU Church door, directing them to our home instead...guests arrived with food and flowers, and I had to tell each one that she had died.  We had a wake instead.  My nursing school Dean and other teachers from my Master's program I was in at St. Lawrence (at the same time) came as well, as did many friends.   Her family, devout Seventh Day Adventists, had withdrawn from her during the illness, but came briefly after I called and begged them to come see her one last time.

​At the time of my beloved Jan's death, my three children were under 15.  I did not inherit Jan's two pensions, I did not get any part of her property, a cabin on 7 acres in the San Juan Islands,  which was co owned by her ex and her (a legal maneuver they had to make when they were together, but it required the consent of her ex to dissolve it, and she refused.) ​ I didn't even get any of her CDs or her IRA as it was still tied up legally in that same agreement with her ex.  Her ex was very wealthy, and I had three young children.  I started my first job some weeks later.  In the meantime, her parents came to our home, when I was not there, with a moving truck and stole everything they wanted, including nearly every tool in the workshop, including those that were mine and those I had given Jan.

If we had been legally able to marry, I would have had enough money to work part time, buy a home, and return to my children wholly and able to care for them, as they, too, had gone through a lot.  As it was, I ended up working tremendously hard, not being able to be there for them as they needed, and pushing myself way too hard.  Marriage is a legal contract that sees to it that in cases like this, a young widow with children is not left out in the cold, by either greedy exes or by institutions that owe pensions.  Now that I am able to legally marry, I will not be subject to this inequality.  For anyone who doesn't understand why people would want to get legally married, this might help you understand.  And for those of you with kids, I encourage you to consider it.  There are some very good reasons to get that protection.

Thank you for reading this.  The grieving for this monumental love has never stopped.  I was married and widowed on the same day, two weeks before I turned 40.  It has not been easy.

February 2016,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/02/04/worm/,"February 2016, 04",Worm,"I’m a 23 year old graduate student, and reading is my favorite hobby. I love how a really good story can change the way I look at things. I also love talking with people about reading, hearing their opinions, getting recommendations, and giving some in turn. My favorite messages from the listserve have been reading recommendations. When I get exposed to something outside of what I’m used to it’s like getting to see from another person’s eyes. In that vein I’d like to give you all a recommendation for something a bit off the beaten path.

A few months back I stumbled across a web serial (like a book but published online a chapter at a time) called Worm. It’s long, about as many words as the complete Song of Ice and Fire series so far. I found it during an incredibly busy time what with life, research, and finals.

I read the whole thing in three weeks.

I read quite a bit in 2015, including many Hugo and Pulitzer prize winners. Worm was without a doubt my favorite read of the year.

Plot Summary from the website: “An introverted teenage girl with an unconventional superpower, Taylor goes out in costume to find escape from a deeply unhappy and frustrated civilian life. Her first attempt at taking down a supervillain sees her mistaken for one, thrusting her into the midst of the local ‘cape’ scene’s politics, unwritten rules, and ambiguous morals. As she risks life and limb, Taylor faces the dilemma of having to do the wrong things for the right reasons.”

While Taylor is a teen and the first few chapters focus on issues she’s having at school this is in no way a work about a teenage hero who has to balance high school against their superhero life. It is instead an answer to the question “What would it be like in the real world if superheroes started appearing?”. There aren’t any pure paragons of virtue or mustachio twirling villains here. Every aspect of the world is carefully considered and every action has consequences.

One of my favorite things about the series is how smart the characters and plotting feel. Fights aren’t won on brute force alone and people very rarely play fair (Taylor especially). As the story progresses the stakes keep rising higher and higher, but there aren’t any cop outs or magical resolutions to problems. The story strikes a nice balance between progressing logically and having enough surprises to keep you guessing what will happen next.

A warning: this series is addictive and many chapters end on cliffhangers, making it difficult to put down. I pulled more than a few late nights while reading it. If you’re in the middle of a busy period it may be best to wait on picking this up.

It’s available in its entirety for free. Just google ‘worm parahumans’ and the first result should be the wordpress site where it was published. There’s also a free unabridged fan made audiobook, just google ‘worm audiobook’.

I hope some of you get as much out of this series as I have. If you want to talk about it with me feel free to email. There’s also an active community over on Reddit at r/Parahumans. Shoutouts to them for giving me advice on how to properly explain the sprawling epic that is Worm.

Finally, if you have any unusual recommendations for books that meant a lot to you I’d love to hear them!

February 2016,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/02/03/all-the-world-is-a-stage/,"February 2016, 03",All the world is a stage,"I remember my mind wandering while I was sitting at my law school commencement ceremony as some completely forgettable speaker droned on in the incredibly hot June sun.  Through my fog I heard him say ""... and for the next 40 years...""  I snapped back to reality instantly.  What?!  The. Next. 40. Years.  A sense of panic swept over me as I thought, ""I can't possibly imagine doing this for that long!""  I was only 25 at the time, and 40 years, well... that was the rest of my life, wasn't it?

So I did it for 15 years.  I thought that since I spent 3 miserable years of my life in law school, I should give it a good run.  But I kept searching for that ""next"" thing, and eventually I found it.  Theatre/production/lighting had always been an interest of mine and I was active in some type of that since I was 12.  And off I went!  It was hard leaving the comfort (and the steady income) of a profession so many people think so much of, but it was the best jump I ever made.  There have been some rocky times, but learning how to handle that first jump has made all the other ones since then easier.

I now find myself, at 49, in a perfect mix of both entertainment and law.  Finally, all of the things that I'm passionate about are part of my daily life.  I never wanted to leave this world someday saying, ""Gee, I wish I would have _____.""  Every time I come across something new, I ask myself if it fits into that question.

I should also share that when I left the law firm I was with at the time, I had to call all of the opposing counsel on my cases and tell them that our case would be reassigned to another attorney in our firm.  Every single lawyer I told, some of them the big partners and stalwarts of the legal community in my city, said they wished they could do what I was doing.  But they had a family.  Or they had a firm.  Or some other reason.  I was shocked that all of them said that.  It helped ease my panic over my move at the time, but I still think of them, still doing the exact same thing, today.

Your life is always going to change.  Please don't be afraid to change with it.

There is this caveIn the air behind my bodyThat nobody is going to touch:A cloister, a silenceClosing around a blossom of fire.When I stand upright in the wind,My bones turn to dark emeralds.

Northern Pike

All right. Try this,Then. Every bodyI know and care for,And every bodyElse is goingTo die in a lonelinessI can't imagine and a painI don't know. We hadTo go on living. WeUntangled the net, we slitThe body of this fishOpen from the hinge of the tailTo a place beneath the chinI wish I could sing of.I would just as soon we letThe living go on living.An old poet whom we believe inSaid the same thing, and soWe paused among the dark cattails and prayedFor the muskrats,For the ripples below their tails,For the little movements that we knew the crawdads were makingunder water,For the right-hand wrist of my cousin who is a policeman.We prayed for the game warden's blindness.We prayed for the road home.We ate the fish.There must be something very beautiful in my body,I am so happy.

A Blessing

Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.And the eyes of those two Indian poniesDarken with kindness.They have come gladly out of the willowsTo welcome my friend and me.We step over the barbed wire into the pastureWhere they have been grazing all day, alone.They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happinessThat we have come.They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.There is no loneliness like theirs.At home once more,They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,For she has walked over to meAnd nuzzled my left hand.She is black and white,Her mane falls wild on her forehead,And the light breeze moves me to caress her long earThat is delicate as the skin over a girl’s wrist.Suddenly I realizeThat if I stepped out of my body I would breakInto blossom.

Hook

I was only a young manIn those days. On that eveningThe cold was so God damnedBitter there was nothing.Nothing. I was in troubleWith a woman, and there was nothingThere but me and dead snow.

I stood on the street cornerIn Minneapolis, lashedThis way and that.Wind rose from some pit,Hunting me.Another bus to Saint PaulWould arrive in three hours,If I was lucky.

Then the young SiouxLoomed beside me, his scarsWere just my age.

Ain't got no bus hereA long time, he said.You got enough moneyTo get home on?

What did they doTo your hand? I answered.He raised up his hook into the terrible starlightAnd slashed the wind.

Oh, that? he said.I had a bad time with a woman. Here,You take this.

Did you ever feel a man holdSixty-five centsIn a hook,And place itGentlyIn your freezing hand?

I was excited to live somewhere so different from Oakland, CA, where I grew up.As part of my job, I get to travel across the South staying with families, visiting synagogues, working with their Sunday Schools, and getting to know people with life experiences and perspectives completely different from my own. As you can imagine, some amazing stories emerge from these visits.

Here are two of them:

At a recent synagogue event in Fayetteville, GA, I asked a woman in her seventies what advice she’d give to a young woman just starting off her life and career. Her advice to me was based on the premise that we live in a man’s world, and that the only way to make it is to be independent without being too pushy, work behind the scenes without expecting credit, and put up with a lot of BS. She told me about a time when she brought a repairman into the phone room to fix something, and he closed the door, saying that he’d only let her out after she kissed him. She looked around the room and picked up a crowbar, telling him that he’d let her out now. He did. She didn’t tell anyone. For an hour after that, she and I talked about how much has changed for women in the workplace since then, and sadly, how much progress still needs to be made. Both of us were so inspired by the other. She was a badass.

I was staying with a Rabbi in McAllen, TX and I got food poisoning. I spent six hours in the middle of the night hunched over a toilet bowl, and he and his wife were nothing but gracious and understanding. A different community member took me to the Emergency Room. As IV fluids were pumped into my veins, we chatted like old friends, even though we had only met the night before. Her advice to me was to go and have adventures before settling down. Though she is from Peru, she spent almost a decade in her twenties living in Florence, Italy, studying and teaching architecture. When she moved back to Peru, she met her husband and they moved to Texas. As strange as it sounds, we had a lovely time in the Emergency Room.

The most important lesson that I’ve learned through these interactions and others like them revolve around the importance of transgenerational relationships. Younger and older people have so much to learn from each other, but we rarely take the opportunity to ask. Aziz Ansari focuses on this issue specifically in an episode of Master of None (watch it on Netflix if you haven’t yet--the whole series is awesome).

Some of my favorite questions to ask have been:

-What advice would you give to a young person just starting off their adult life?-What mistakes did you make in your twenties that you are most grateful for now?-How did you get to ________ (name of city of residence)?

So, with that in mind, people of the listserv, here are my questions to you:

What advice would you give to a 23 year old woman just starting off her adult life?What music are you listening to right now?Where is the favorite place you’ve traveled to?

I look forward to your responses!

And, here I am, winning the list serv while traveling in China. Do I consider myself adventurous? Perhaps... Really, I like to think I am an explorer.

I read once that experiences make you happier than possessions. I believe this to be true. Whether it be the best house, or car, or even a pair of shoes (and I'll admit I have somewhat of a love for the latter), these things can all be lost. Experiences will always stay with us forever. What's been most important to me is that no matter where you are, however different people may seem, we are all the same. We love our children, we want to be happy, to spend our time with the people we love and doing things we love. We miss the people who have departed us, and we celebrate the most important moments in our life.

And so I explore the many diverse ways that we accomplish the same things. And I hope that this gives me some humility that my ways are no better or worse, and that I can keep adding to my wealth of experiences.

All my love to my family and friends, and missing dearly the ones who have departed.

It was afterschool and we rushed home. It was sort of sloppy, it was surprisingly long. I had left the door open. I should have mentioned my dad's nickname was half-day Howie.  Mid-act I looked up and saw him standing at my bedroom door. He never mentioned it other than saying to me later that day: ""next time, keep the door shut."" 

I was 16. We met on a family road trip at a beach in Kelowna. He was from Calgary too and like me, was sixteen. We started dating. Meanwhile, my mother had introduced me to a ""handsome boy"" who happened to be  20 years old-  ("" I know, weird right?"").  I wanted to be with the older boy, but I didn't want to be with him as a virgin. So I lost my virginity to the sixteen year old. Right after that I cheated on him with the 20 year old who I stayed with for three years.  

I was 16. We had been dating a year, and decided it was time. We got a hotel room near our boarding school. All our friends ended up coming over to party. We eventually kicked them out and did it. I would say it was uneventful. When we were done they all came back in and we continued to party. 

I was 19. We had been together a while. It was on the deck of my parent's house- we used to pull our beds out onto the porch to sleep. I remember it not being very comfortable, but I wanted to do it again immediately. 

I would love to hear your story too.

I spent the morning in Bikram yoga (only, they don’t call it Bikram anymore), sweating. Afterward, I scanned my local Facebook group for news of any new beer releases. I made a salad for lunch. I drank some coffee. I read over a talk I’m scheduled to give at a major university in a few weeks. I clocked myself at 35 minutes.

I am the chair of a small department focused on writing and rhetoric. I try to do yoga twice a week. I go to the gym the other days. For 90 minutes in a yoga class, I sweat. The studio air smells of sweat. The changing room smells of sweat. I earned my PhD in Gainesville, Florida, a city I remember mainly for the amount of sweating I did there.

For many academics, the six years to tenure is one of metaphoric sweating. To get tenure in a research university, we write. My talk is about writing and craft beer.  I’ve reached the highest rank possible as professor. We call that rank: full. It’s a Friday afternoon, I drank my coffee. Ate a salad. Read over a talk. I feel full. I feel full not because of food, exercise, or hearing the sound of my own voice for 35 minutes as if I were speaking to a room of other academics. I feel full in general.

It’s Friday afternoon. We have a debate on a local Facebook group about whether or not the local market is “too full” for any new craft beer bars or breweries. My five year old son takes an hour to eat one hot dog, and without finishing, declares: “I’m full.” Academics across my Facebook feed post daily complaints about the world: the economy, the Republicans, the Middle East, education, their own lives. Backchannel – among other friends – we accuse them of being “full of it.”

Three years ago, when I first started what we used to call Bikram Yoga, I was advised to not eat too much before a class. “You don’t want to be full when you do yoga,” I was told. Bikram, the accusations claim, was too full of sexual ego. Studios dropped his name from their mastheads in response to allegations of sexual misconduct. He was written out of yoga.

I am full in general. I belong to a profession that, at times, feels dedicated to complaining. These complaints include: “it’s too difficult to be a professor; no one ever talks about X, this political position is wrong, if only X didn’t happen, there wouldn’t be conflict in Y country.” Academics raised on reading novels and writing essays, it seems, know it all. Have a problem? No sweat. The professor will solve it. She’ll write about it online.

I don’t do yoga to solve any problem other than the back ache that plagued me for maybe 20 years. I hid my back pain in order to serve in an infantry unit. I hid my back pain in order to do difficult work in agriculture. But my pain did not hide from me. I was full of so much pain one Chicago summer that I could barely move. I went to yoga for no reason other than to learn to stretch in a hot, sweaty room for 90 minutes. And it worked.

I'm a 27 year old male musician/percussionist in MA. I hit marimbas with four sticks. Right now I teach elementary music, but I'm working on going back to school to get my masters degree... and maybe eventually a PhD to become a Percussion Professor. Right now, that's the plan. But plans can change, right?

I teach high school music ensembles after school, and late at night I write music. This is what I love the most, the writing. I've always loved writing, even before I wrote music I loved writing- words, that is. Maybe my plan will change and I'll write music for a living somehow... I dunno. Leave all doors open, I always told myself.

I believe love is a choice. (Maybe a great first blog subject?)I do not believe in soul mates.I believe that I wake up every day and make the choice to stay with her. I have yet to regret it, hence the seven year mark.I do not think I ever will regret it.I believe I'm lucky for feeling strongly about this.But I do not believe that there is a rush to get married or procreate. These things will come with time, and I am young, and I have things to do before I ""settle down"" in this manner. Right now, I have her, and my loving family, and a strong network of supportive friends, and ambition. That is enough, for now.

__________

I believe there is a certain level of responsibility that comes with being lucky. That being provided certain opportunities and a certain station in life, it is my duty to take advantage of the world around me; to own my station and live a full life if I can. 

Yes, I feel that I have the responsibility to help those in need, simply because I have the power. But I am a coward. I make small gestures here and there... a few donations, spotting the homeless some crackers on my way home from work when they walk past my car.... but I am afraid to do more. To sacrifice personal comfort. 

This keeps me up at night.

So, this is pretty cool, and pretty terrifying all at the same time.

First, a little about me.  I'm married, and live in Minnesota, USA.  My husband and I are working on acquiring children, but for now are making due with our three goofball cats that we just smother with all the lovins.

I'm an accountant at a group home management company for adults and children with special needs, mostly with profound disabilities, both mental and physical, though we are branching out into elder care.  If you are in Minneapolis/St Paul, and would like to work with some of these great people, shoot me an email!

I love playing World of Warcraft, watching YouTube videos, and I have recently started a rewatch of all the Power Ranger series, first the American version, then the Japanese version.  I also enjoy bar trivia--my group of friends and I have been racking up the wins in the last few weeks.

If you are bored, and want to amuse yourself with terribly written TV show reviews, feel free to check out my blog, Melissa's Miscellany, though I haven't updated it in three years or so.

I only have one piece of advice, mostly for college students: If you do decide to get an Arts degree, I would HIGHLY suggest minoring in marketing,  because if you are going to be an artist, you really need to know how to sell yourself. However, don't feel like you HAVE to go to college.  The trades need strong people to go into them as well, and don't require a 4-year degree.

And lastly, for those of us who think today's music is crap, remember, the number one song in May 1974 was 'The Streak.'  And yes, it was about a streaker.

Take care everyone!

January 2016,26,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/01/26/the-closet-mine-and-yours/,"January 2016, 26",The closet (mine and yours),"I finally came out, in dribs and drabs, in my mid-twenties. I’d moved an entire continent away from my sleepy, WASPy hometown. I had new friends, was dating, and finally felt I had nothing to lose.

You don’t just come out once though – you do it over and over again in excruciating repetition. Occasionally I said outright, “Oh, I’m gay,” but mostly I mentioned that I “had a date with a girl from Ireland,” or something else that let me slip the right pronouns in casually. This strained understatement hid just how much I did care what people though. Each time I felt like a finely-tuned barometer to their responses. Most were indifferent, some surprised. My male flatmate said, “if I was a girl I'd probably be a lesbian too.”

I’d known that I liked other women for a decade. I met a girl when I was fifteen and we were close in the way that best friends are close, until one day she kissed me and asked if it was all right and everything tumbled forward, as though we both knew, and had always known. We didn’t have words or language for this. Our silence gave us space to savour what the world around us corrupted. That silence was fear, but there was self-preservation and love there too. And defiance: an unwillingness to perform the act of confession for things that should never have to be confessed.

The problem is that secrets, however justified, begin to feel shameful. And shame is corrosive. It consumes you, right down to places where you were the most solid. It extends outward to your fingertips until everything you touch is fiction. You float through life a step removed, because you are fake – a fantasy in which you yourself no longer believe. The closet – whatever closet – is a lonely place. It holds you captive in the gap between your true self and outward persona. As you close yourself off to avoid vulnerability, you pay in loneliness; no one sees you as you really are. And it’s hard to drag yourself through the motions of a life that isn’t yours. It’s like sleepwalking.

That heaviness followed me until I couldn’t move anymore, and loneliness pushed me out the door. Now I am grateful that I had that push, because when you have to be different you learn it is better anyway. You can be fearless. Sometimes, the same loneliness still reverberates through my life. I’m struggling to pull a voice from silence, to write and create and be willing to be exposed (like this!). I was initially horrified to have won the listserv because I didn’t know what to say. But the invitation is a push, to take the leap across the gap; to seize a story, any story. So I’m taking it, because I know there is more happiness to be had outside the closet than in it.

“To write as if your life depended on it; to write across the chalkboard, putting up there in public the words you have dredged; sieved up in dreams, from behind screen memories, out of silence – words you have dreaded and needed in order to know you exist.” (Adrienne Rich)

I’m scared, scared from fading away and becoming a mere memory.” The Red House is in danger of being demolished, to be replaced by yet another grey high-rise. Its residents have been ordered to evacuate, and pack centuries of memories in five days.

If the Red House could speak, it would tell us, “I’m a gem, special and rare, still standing in Ras Beirut, at the heart of the capital of Lebanon.” The Red House is a landmark of the area, being one of the last surviving historic houses of Ras Beirut. It stands vibrant with its famous red door, red windows, and green trees. It’s an oasis in a city that is losing its color to urbanization and concrete. Its Red Windows would count how they witnessed the changes in the city over the years.

If the Red House could speak, it would tell us how it feels treated like a Queen by its current resident and all the family, friends and even strangers that visit it. Samir, an architect and conservationist who was born and raised in the Red House, took very good care of it, keeping it well-maintained and preserving its architectural historical features. Samir, also a gastronome who cooks passionately always welcomes visitors to lunch or dinner with a delicious home cooked meal.

If the Red House could speak, it would tell us how it reigned like a Kind during the many wars the city witnessed. It protected many from the surrounding bomb shelling. Countless family and friends took refuge inside its strong and warm walls.

If the Red House could speak, it probably would still hold some secrets, but couldn’t help but brag about the role it played in the independence of Lebanon. Many meetings were held in its central hall by prominent political figures, discussing Lebanon and plotting its independence in the early 1940s.

If the Red House could speak, it would take a deep breath, close its eyes, and wonder how long it would still stand its ground. It’s difficult to remember how Ras Beirut was back in the 18th century, when the first part of the Red House was built, in the middle of fields of orange trees. The lady of the house at that time planted more trees in its courtyard. Now, the trees outlast the surrounding concrete jungle.

If the Red House could speak, it would recount endless stories of all the people who cherished it, lived in it, and passed by. If its Red Door could smile, it would smile back at all the curious strangers, peeking through it, trying to get a glimpse of the hidden garden and courtyard behind.

If the Red House could speak, it would scream, “I want to stay alive!”

If the Red House could speak, it would reply, “I hear you, thank you!” to all the people that are offering their support in our current efforts to safeguard an icon of Lebanese traditional houses, and to keep our values and heritage alive.

If the Red House could speak, it would tell us, “I love you back!”

The Red House would love your support as well. It is on Instagram (the_red_house_in_ras_beirut) and Facebook (theredhouseinrasbeirut).

I had and experience at the buss recently. I decided to test it and probably will again. I stared at a passanger from the back with the intention for him to notice.  He then moved up to the front of the buss and looked behind my way. Coincidence?  It happens often that I glance at someone and they suddenly notice me. So I don't know.

Of course you did. You're probably reading this either on your phone or your computer, which is probably connected to the Internet. In turn, that device is probably logged into Facebook, and on Facebook, you probably noticed approximately everyone you've ever met proclaiming how sad it made THEM, what David Bowie meant to THEM, how David Bowie changed THEIR life.

Where does this tendency come from, to take these events that shake the world, and reframe them around ourselves? Where did we get the idea that we're all so interesting that the conversation is better served if we make it about us?There are so many interesting things to say about the man and the fantastic voyage he led us upon, but on social media, most folks are enacting this mechanistic “this-is-what-he-means-to-ME” routine as if they were completing coursework, as if they were behaving that way because they were expected to. Conversely, the biggest Bowie fans I know were conspicuously private about the whole thing.

It all reminds me of the titular bit from Anthony Jeselnik's latest special, Thoughts and Prayers. (On paper, Jeselnik looks exactly like the kind of comedian I tend to dislike, but unlike your Bill Burr types, he takes responsibility for his provocation. He doesn't act like a victim of ""society"" because he ""can't tell"" a certain kind of joke anymore since we're all so ""politically correct"", and in not doing so, he proves those others wrong. Anyhow.) The title of his special refers to the reflexive, thoughtless way that people proffer their thoughts and prayers in times of tragedy. He suggests that when people do that sort of thing, they are deflecting focus about these major events onto themselves – in effect, performing a tiny cry for attention.

Now, Bowie's death wasn't a tragedy by any stretch, but by the looks of things on social media the following morning, it definitely tapped into the same emotional vein. So when people rush to social media to lament the passing of an icon, is that a genuine effort to reach out and connect with people? Or is it just another plea to be noticed? Certainly, everyone's motives are different, but even if we'd strenuously deny that the motivation behind our ostentatious social media mourning is to garner attention, maybe we'd be lying in doing so. Humans have subconscious urges, and we can't always explain them when these sprouts of thought break the surface. We can only hope to rationalize them, ex post facto. Few would admit, even to themselves, that their very public expressions of grief are cries for attention in disguise, but even still, perhaps there's an ugly truth buried deep in our minds which we'd like to ignore.

This week has brought forth many thinkpieces about the nature of grief as it intersects with social media. Many have been critical of the self-aggrandizing way that people have been memorializing online, which in turn has raised a bunch of scorn towards these so-called “grief police”. I feel like there's validity to both perspectives. It's absolutely true that no one has any business telling anyone else how they ought to deal with loss. However, once you've gone and constructed a cheap edifice from your sadness, then put it on public display, you've reshaped the landscape of the conversation, and it becomes, in part, your responsibility.

~~~ Bonus Poem ~~~

My enemy is comingOn horses black as sootTheir axes gleam in sunlightThe miles race underfootTogether with his servantsAll fierce and riding hardKing of Men, God Emperor,The Infinity Shard

And when he comes to kill meI’ll neither beg nor weepFor I am a free womanAnd I’ll die on my feet.

I will not sing his praisesNor obey his commandI’ll never recognize his claimTo rule my native landI’ll stoke fires of rebellionRemind the world they’re freeI’ll burn down every buildingOf his evil ministry

My every breath is treasonI face certain defeatBut I am a free womanAnd I’ll die on my feet

I will not lock my heart down tightFor fear that it may breakEmotion is no weaknessAlong this path I takeI will find the strength to fightAnd be human stillI won’t shut up to save myselfAnd I’ll love who I will

No matter how it pains meMy heart and soul I’ll keepI’ll live a free womanAnd I’ll die on my feet.

We cannot live dividedAlong lines soaked in bloodOld debts must be forgivenLest all drown in the floodOur Ruler likes us squabblingHe feeds feuds centuries longBut we can overcome our pastTogether, we are strong

And when he comes to strike us downWe will not bend our kneeBecause we are free peopleAnd we’ll die on our feet.

January 2016,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/01/16/the-biggest-lie-ive-ever-been-told/,"January 2016, 16",The biggest lie I've ever been told,"“Insurmountable financial challenges."" That’s what the e-mail said.

With no warning whatsoever, the interim president announced that my alma mater was closing. It took the community -- faculty, students, parents, and alums -- about a day to figure out that finances were just an excuse for something more nefarious that had been in the works for quite a while.

Long story short, we saved Sweet Briar College. And fortunately, our newfound reputation as a college that teaches students not to take no for an answer has garnered us record numbers of applications for 2016-17. But no one has been held accountable for what almost certainly involves criminal conduct. The old “leadership” simply resigned, and the president walked away with hundreds of thousands of dollars of severance (from an interim position!).

I really hate that the narrative in the media and elsewhere is that the college was running out of money until the alumnae swooped in and saved the day. No, it wasn't. (But yes, we did.)

The reality seems to be that key players were trying to kill Sweet Briar because for them, the value of its 3,250-acre campus had eclipsed its 114-year legacy of educating women. There are still some gaps in our collective understanding of what happened, but here's what we know:

- The stated reason for the closure was declining student enrollment and inadequate alumnae giving -- but the top positions in both admissions and development had been left unfilled for about two years (and despite that, enrollment was only slightly down from the record high).

- In announcing the closure, the president (who had come to Sweet Briar after being fired from his previous college for, among other things, fiscal impropriety) pointed to the proportion of students who were minorities, low-income, and/or first-generation college students as evidence that the college was not worth trying to save. (!!)

- He also claimed that the $80-90 million endowment minus the $55 million that’s restricted to specific purposes and $25 million in bond debt (payable over a decade) left the college basically broke -- fuzzy math at its finest.

- The Virginia Attorney General, who has jurisdiction to prosecute violations of charitable giving laws and mismanagement of trusts, not only refused to intervene but actually went to court to argue against the county attorney's authority to do so on our behalf. (The court sided with the county attorney.) Was the Attorney General motivated by campaign contributions from an individual or business who stood to gain from the closure?

- As of the day of the announcement, the college administration had already begun the processof seeking the Attorney General's permission to use funds for purposes other than those for which they were donated, in order to close the college and repurpose the endowment into some sort of scholarship fund -- but they wouldn't, and didn't, seek to have those same funds unrestricted to use in support of the ongoing operation of the college (not even for a single year to allow the juniors to graduate and to give underclassmen the time to fully explore transfer options).

We don’t know what the plans were for the campus, but theories have included a resort, Disney park, emergency shelter for D.C. officials (similar to the The Greenbrier resort), and government intelligence/communications center. The reality, though, is that the campus is big enough to fit ALL of these endeavors at the same time, with room to spare. It’s killing me not to know what was deemed worthy of breaking multiple laws to put on our campus.

There’s so much more I could say, but I’m up against the word limit. If you’d like more information about this situation (or about Sweet Briar) or want to trade theories, shoot me an e-mail.

Context: I wrote this poem just prior to the 2004 Super Bowl pitting the Carolina Panthers against the New England Patriots—two teams who might meet each other again this year post-playoffs. I enjoy watching football. But like many other fans, I have had my enjoyment complicated by the reports of traumatic brain injuries among current and former players. This also complicates my consideration of the sins inherent in enjoying football. This year and every year, I will watch and I will hope the best team wins and that no one gets hurt.

We all do. Thank you for this serendipity. This is flash fiction though based on true hallucinations. Trigger warning for suicidal thoughts and torture and death mentions.

----I have nowhere to hide. It’s all over the news and they’re marching from NYC to NJ to torture and murder me. I have to take a scathing hot shower; the anchorwoman said they’ll go easy on me if I’m clean. This is my third shower in thirty minutes and I’m still filthy.

They said so.

Shut off the TV, they can’t see you if it’s off. But the cameras are everywhere and we’re broadcasting live over the internet. I can’t fucking find them. It’s too late.

But I have a chance right now. They only want to kill me, not my family. If I run away now, my family will stand a chance. I love them.  I don’t want them to die. I have to run while it’s cloudy. They’ll come here when it’s sunny, the weatherman said so. Escape now. No one is looking. But I have nowhere to go and I can’t run for long. GO.

I couldn’t get far, my Dad caught me. He tells me it’s not real. That I’m going through psychosis again. My third one in five years.

Why?

He tells me to watch TV but I can’t. They’re all making fun of me. I tried to play a game on “Let’s Make A Deal” but I think I killed someone. I tried to do a dance for them, but I picked the wrong answer and now someone is dead.

I didn’t mean to. I’m so sorry. I’m so so sorry.

Where is my sister? Is she still alive? Is she really at school? I saw an explosion in the water on a Filipino TV show about mermaids, but it was a message to my family that she was killed. And it was all my fault. Why didn’t I tell her that I love her before she left home? Why couldn’t it be me?

I wrote a letter just now to my mother, rescinding my rights, declaring myself insane and unfit, pleading to be euthanized. I can’t live like this. They’re in the shadows, waiting for me to sleep. I can’t stay awake forever.  She read it aloud and now they know my plan.

She’s crying now. Please don’t cry because of me. I’m not worth it.

But none of it’s real. I’m not the failed savior of the world. The recession is not my fault. No one has become a martyr because of me. The women magazines, funny pages, the graphic novel in my hands, newspaper headlines, soap operas, talk shows, the Good Wife, Glee, ad faxes, songs on the radio, play by plays, strangers on their phones - none of them are talking about me. The whispers aren’t real. The voices aren’t real. I’m reading everything wrong but I can’t fucking stop.

I am Regina Cordova. I am 24 years old. I live on 23 Greenwood Ave. in Carteret, NJ. I’m Filipina American. I am not the reincarnation of an ancient god. I cannot raise the dead nor travel through time.  My family loves me. None of this is real. I will get through this. I will get help. I will love the world and myself again.

I will.----

January 2016,12,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/01/12/a-venn-diagram-of-sorts/,"January 2016, 12",A Venn Diagram of Sorts,"Hello ! I'm excited to share with you one of my biggest passions and one of my biggest fears, and how they overlap-ish :

A : My greatest passion is architecture. Architecture and design are everywhere. I'm currently getting my masters in architecture in New York City, but I originally studied anthropology. When I first started studying architecture, the only things I could talk about were buildings and their effects on behavior until a friend told me he didn't care about architecture at all. Initially, I was shocked — everyone lives, works and interacts with architecture on a daily basis, how could someone not care? I then realized — not everyone will care about what I care about most.

Studying architecture, I've learned that someone has designed almost everything around us, and that has dramatically changed the way I see the world. From the spoon we use for our cereal to the buildings we work in, it has all been designed. Paying attention to design adds levels of appreciation to the most mundane activities. Noticing the way light enters a space, or even the weight of different objects can add a level of awareness and presence to any given moment. Careful design isn't just a visual aesthetic, it impacts our experience, perception, and mental and physical health. Increasing awareness of design can brighten our day, and better yet, understanding design begins to give credit and agency to designers themselves and their hard work.

B : My greatest fear is systemic violence. I am terrified when I see the growing Islamophobia, racial violence, and sexism in the media and on the street every day. When I think about how people are cruel to one another based on prejudices about each other's identities', to be honest, I'm scared out of my mind.

I, myself, know that I'm very privileged, but being a brown woman in the United States has made me very aware of how people with the same capabilities and ambition as me don't necessarily have the same incredible opportunities I have. If you are lucky enough to have some form of privilege, it means a lot to think about those who don't to prevent the cycles of systemic violence. Understanding systemic violence is difficult and complicated, especially if you do not feel personally affected by discrimination or prejudice.

A+B : My love of architecture and my fear of systemic violence meet in the middle as I'm trying to find ways to design solutions that will positively impact individuals and communities. Design has the potential solve many of the world's biggest problems in new and innovative ways, from housing shortages to disaster relief to clean water.

I strongly believe that with privilege comes a responsibility to empathize with and help those who are less fortunate. The world will be a better place if we each make an effort to pay more attention to discrimination and to fight it to help those around us live equally fulfilling lives. Do something about it.

Might as well try and see what happens, right?

For all the great things that have happened, there’s been an almost equal number of bad things. I guess that’s true for most people. All in all, I’m very fortunate.

Beginning when I was 34, I dealt with the reality of Stage 4 colon cancer (it spread to my liver); went through two major surgeries and had two separate chemo treatments over 3 years. This was 18 years ago and my case has been mentioned in a book, I’ve spoken nationally and appeared on TV programs telling my story. Currently, I’m on the board of the Colon Cancer Coalition and was a spokesperson with Olympian Dara Torres for the Colon Cancer Alliance as well as in an ad campaign for MD Anderson.

I’m a marketing guy. Some of my previous roles include the VP of Marketing for Buca di Beppo restaurants and VP Marketing for Del Taco among other restaurants and brands. Later, as an ad agency executive, I helped develop campaigns for brands such as Red Robin, Toshiba Imaging, and others. Now I build brands, brainstorm and create marketing strategies for new and existing restaurant concepts and other small businesses.

It’s a fun life. Having cancer allowed me to become a better person. Yes, it sucked and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone but the support and love from my wife (who is the ultimate reason why I’m still alive) my kids, family and friends is something I’ll never be able to repay.

Here’s another story line.I helped launch a professional, non-profit theater company 4 years ago in Claremont, CA, my home. It’s a beautiful college town in Southern California known for the various Claremont Colleges. My wife, who is a director and has a Masters in Theater, always wanted to bring quality theater to this part of LA County. We’ve been involved with other theaters in the area but had the dream to present challenging works that “get audiences talking.” If not now, when? So we built Ophelia’s Jump (thanks, Cancer). Our first production was August: Osage County and since then we’ve built a strong reputation with plays such as Clybourne Park, David Mamet’s Boston Marriage, a Summer Shakespeare Festival and others. We bring professional actors, and technicians together and offer internships and opportunities for new playwrights and directors. We were voted best theater company in our first year by a local magazine and have received numerous awards and the support of the community and audiences from Los Angeles and Orange Counties.

If I never had cancer, I don't think we would have taken this leap with Ophelia’s Jump. It’s been a labor of love and our lives are full because of the people we surround ourselves with. Currently we are growing this group and hope to build our own home - a blackbox theater in the future where we can house the arts full time. If you find yourself in our area, I hope you contact me and joins us at Ophelia’s Jump.

If the cancer came back tomorrow and it was all over. I’d be fine. I’m having a great time for as long as it lasts.

All the best to all of you and drop me a line at  or on Twitter @randylopez.

The two types of people are, those that tell stories...and those that get paid to tell stories.

Who want's to hear your story?  I’ll tell you...

First, let me ask you some tough questions…

Honestly, they might make you uncomfortable.

All I ask is that you read the questions, ask them of yourself, and be honest.

You ready?

OK, here we go…

How is the next year of your life going to be different from this one?Here’s the deal…if you have been reading about everyone else's story, reading books, and watch documentaries, you are probably where they were just a few years ago.

You dream of living a better life, but you feel like you are spinning your wheels...

Maybe you blog a little….Your email list is growing slowly, if at all. Your writing is even slower. You don’t feel like you are reaching the world with your message.

Well, the good news is that you can change that!

But how?

That brings us to question two…

Do you have a plan?Seriously, do you have a plan in mind to make this year better than last year?

Are you just making it up as you go? Chasing every new shiny object that comes your way.

...spending all your time looking for “tricks” and “tools” that barely move the needle, when what you need is a PLAN.

What options do you have?

One option:Publish a book.  People out there are willing to PAY for your everyday, walk around knowledge.

You heard me right. (not a typo)

I'm talking about writing a non-fiction book and promoting it online...I have people ask me all the time if they can actually make money selling short ebooks online, and my answer is without hesitation, YES.  I enjoy helping people with it too.

There’s a simple way you can get in the “back door” of major book websites...and get featured online, if you know how.

My friend started out as a dead-broke bread distributor, and created a short e-book that he put up on a website for $2.99 and through some simple marketing, he sold over 65,000 ebooks online.

He quit his job.  Spends more time with his family.  Started writing more books.  Helping more people.

Is it easy?  No.

Is it worth it?  I think so….but, you’ve got to answer that for yourself.

Anything worthwhile takes effort.  I just helped another guy get to #1 best seller on Amazon right before Christmas….it’s fun to help people share their message.

You’ve got the ability and freedom to write (even if you’re not very good) and make a living for yourself online.

Go for it.  I believe everyone has a unique story and path that God has put them on that can inspire and help someone else.

I'd like to hear from you, even if you feel like you have a book in you but have no idea what you'd write it about.

What is your story?

Reply with #Listserve so I can filter your messages and I'll reply to all your emails.

By some strange coincidence, it turned out our parents knew each other, so we had things in common to talk about.

Three years later I was leaving South Africa to join my girlfriend in the US, had borrowed money for travel costs and a few months’ living expenses to get established. Through my own naivety got robbed on the train on the way to Johannesburg from Cape Town, went to the airport with nothing but my ticket to Luxembourg, passport, and maybe enough money to buy a standby ticket to New York. Got through security and the only available seat in the crowded waiting area was next to a guy with long hair, guitar, cowboy hat and boots, and a slightly familiar air. Turns out it was his brother, and he had a ticket on the same flight to Luxembourg, from where he was due to catch a bus to his family in Switzerland.

We swapped life stories as we waited, arranged to sit together on the plane, and carried on the conversation, even singing a few songs we knew to pass the time. As we parted at the Luxembourg airport, (me planning to hitch-hike to the UK, where I had heard the tickets were cheaper) he opened his wallet and gave me everything in it, getting on the bus before I could figure out what to say.

I turned around, went back into the Airport and bought a standby ticket on Iceland Air to New York, with enough left over to fly to Grand Junction, Colorado, and as it turned out, to buy two one-way tickets on a Greyhound bus from Colorado back to the East Coast, where my new life began.

I now have two kids in University, am wondering what to do with the rest of my life, but feeling optimistic about the future.

January 2016,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2016/01/06/against-our-kids-best-interests/,"January 2016, 06",Against Our Kids' Best Interests?,"Unlike many of the Listserve members, I am well past my sell-by date! Now in my late 60s, I’ve spent my life in dual careers – as an artist, a writer, a peace and justice advocate and trainer, often working in places no one wants to go – Rwanda, Burundi, the Congo, etc.  And one thing I’ve yet to figure out is why people do NOT act in their own interest, with our own children the most unfortunate beneficiaries of our neglect.

So, who's in charge?

Understanding the answer to this question, one of the many I frequently ask myself and others before whom I speak, is of critical importance if we’re to begin to understand what's going on with kids today.

The answer, of course, is simple.  Despite the fact that they think they are in charge, our children are not.  We adults are.  Even though the world will be run by those who are children today, the decisions that are affecting them before they're old enough to assume leadership are being made by us, grown-ups who have the power, who vote, who contribute to the public fisc, and who make economic and political decisions that are, at least in theory, in the best interests of our children.

Why, then, do I see such a striking similarity between the symptoms our children are exhibiting and the symptoms of victims of traditional torture?

I first began to notice this resemblance decades ago as I studied the effects of war and conflict on children.  At that time, because few people in this country noticed that our own children were in danger, it was easier to travel to the Middle East, the Soviet Union and Northern Ireland to gather my information.  Recently, I've been stunned by how much our own children resemble those whom I've studied overseas.

There are, of course, many complex issues related to any discussion of torture, and it is especially difficult to formulate a perfect definition, but in my studies, several key points have stood out.  The first is in the definition used by the United Nations General Assembly in 1984 which states that torture need not be physical, but can also be mental maltreatment.  The second is that torture is defined not only by the acts committed but also by the individual's response to these acts.

Think about some kids you know and ask yourself these questions about them:  Do they have a reduced involvement with, or are they numb to, the external world?  Do they dissociate and disconnect from friends and loved ones?  Do you sense that they experience the loss of the ability to feel close?  Are they anxious, depressed, irritable, aggressive?  Have they regressed in behavior and school performance?  Do they feel powerless and vulnerable?  And, most striking to me, have they lost the ability to maintain an optimistic outlook or a ""futureview"" of any kind?  These are symptoms of children who have been tortured and, I am afraid, increasingly of our children, too.So, who's in charge?

The sad fact is that few Americans blame themselves for having contributed to the social ills they bemoan.  A recent poll, for example, indicates that only 11% of respondents say they believe that their own behavior has contributed to the moral problems the nation faces, and 96% say that they believe they are doing an excellent or good job teaching their children about morals and values.  But 93% say that other parents aren't taking enough responsibility for teaching their children moral values.

The bottom line is that we remain reluctant to subject our own behavior to criticism or limitations yet we profess to abhor the national moral vacuum that surrounds us.  But there is no moral vacuum.  There is, however, a moral hypocrisy: the difference between what we say and what we do.

 If we talk right and act wrong, according to Marion Wright Edelman, we are contributing to the crisis our children face.  The phrase should be ""watch my feet,"" not ""watch my lips"" because if we are not walking our talk, we are part of the problem and not part of the solution.

I’d appreciate any feedback!

With respect,

I'm a bisexual divorced mom who's currently in a relationship with a gay man. This man and I have been best friends for 31 years- we met in preschool. Everything is fantastic except we don't have sex- only to procreate. We have a son together. Most people say it can't work, and I say it does, except for that. I wish he would want me in that way, but what can you do? My marriage was an abusive one, and I refuse to ever be in a relationship like that again. I'd rather be in a perfect sexless relationship than a sex-filled abusive relationship.

Just wanted to let you know that there are mixed orientation relationships out there that people choose and it can work. Perfect? No. Better than the alternative? Yes.

But I get restless staying in one place for too long, I need to get away sometimes. A few summers ago I had a two month internship at a major airline. The biggest perk: free flights. I spent every weekend exploring differ cities in a region I'd never spent any time in. Since then, I've just wanted to see it all. So I turn to my friends here on the listsevre - where should I go next? Where have you been that is truly a must-see? When going to this place, what should I do or where should I go? I don't like to do typical tourist stuff, I like to go off the beaten path. For example, I think the best place I went during my summer at the airline was New Mexico, the best meal I ate was a hole in the wall burrito spot under a highway in San Diego. I'm willing to take any and all suggestions.

I never write back to people on the listserve so maybe I won't get any replies, but I'd love to get as much input as I can.

I actually just won the listserve at the end of February and talked about my thoughts on time, my transition to studying abroad in Australia, and finally my move great city of San Francisco with my girlfriend, Hana. Well, 10 months and a lifetime full of memories in Southeast Asia later, here I am, writing to all of you from the Bay Area.

I want to start by writing about my girlfriend because she has really inspired to me lately. After watching fashion blogging stars like Weylie and Michelle Phan (shout out if ya’ll read this!) she decided she wanted to pursue her passion for fashion through creating her own YouTube channel. Rather than worrying over the fact that she had no previous filming or editing experience, she just jumped head first into the world of YouTube and fashion blogging. She has spent countless hours honing her skills and, in 4 short months, has almost reached her initial goal of 1,000 subscribers! I figured since 2015 isn’t over yet, I’d toss my hat into the ring for boyfriend of the year award by sharing her channel with all of you. Despite being the “Instagram Husband” behind her videos, I seriously couldn't be more proud of her and how far she’s come. I also really appreciate anyone who takes the time to check out how talented she is :D

Hana's Instagram: @Hanaylee

Hana’s YouTube: since I can't add links :( you can find her by searching for Hana Lee on YouTube!

As for myself, I was inspired by Hana to take a product management course at General Assembly. I’m currently in a rotational program trying to figure out what I want to do with my life and lately I’ve been leaning towards product management. The idea of building something new, something that could change the lives of others is just too appealing, no matter how unrealistic that might be. That said, I’m also looking to get more involved in the startup scene in San Francisco and meet entrepreneurs who are putting in the hustle day in and day out. If that’s you then I’d love to hear more about what you are doing!

I’ll end my 2nd moment of fame the same way I ended my first, with an open invitation. I’m still fairly new to San Francisco, so if you’re ever in the mood for a free drink (coffee, beer, pick your poison), I’d love to meet you!

There are not a lotof bad words in Japanese. If you want to insult someone, you do itcompletely by using the wrong politeness levels. Japanese has differentlevels of politeness built-in and you can measure the social statusbetween people just by listening to them (and even what their status iscompared to another person they are talking about). So when you want toinsult someone, you use higher status vocabulary for yourself and lowerfor the other person. You use different words for ""I"" and ""You"" and ifyou are Yakuza-style all the words start to end in ""eeeee"" ;)Japanese has two syllable-alphabets and uses Chinese characters (Kanji)as well. Until 2010 the standard set of Kanji to be used inofficial documents, newspapers etc (the so-called ""daily usedcharacters"") were 1945. In 2010 they increased that number by 196 newcharacters (and removed 5) because all the people are using computersand cell phones to communicate nowadays, thus writing by hand is not soimportant anymore and adding more characters is therefore not that muchof a problem. What reading Japanese makes hard is that one Kanji in Japanese can haveup to 12 ways readings - depending on the word it is used in or whichsyllables follow. In Chinese one character has one reading. The reasonis that for one Chinese and Japanese are very different languages withChinese being a tonal one and Japanese being a language that isn'ttonal, thus characters got several usages. In addition there wereseveral phases words got imported from China and each time anotherChinese dialect was the base for the final Japanese reading. The consequence is that its hard to learn to read Japanese. And when youneed to use paper dictionaries, you use two dictionaries usually. Onecharacter-dictionary and another one which is more like a traditionalone. With experience you get pretty good in guessing the readings, butits always a lot of searching if the searched combination of charactersisn't already in the character dictionary.The origins of Japanese are unclear but it is probably an Altaiclanguage with relations to Turkish and Mongolian. The language closestto Japanese is Korean. You can easily translate one language into theother. What is most interesting is that they are grammatically verysimilar but the lexic (the words) is totally different. I.e. the word""to eat"" is ""taberu"" but ""meogda"" in Korean. But when you get to wordsloan from Chinese, someone who knows Japanese can get a lot of knowingKanji (Hanja in Korean) and what the Korean reading for the characteris. Korean also uses only one reading for a Hanja. But nowadays Hanjaare rarely used in Korean. But Korean has with Hangeul the best""alphabet"" ever. It's easier to learn to read and write than any otherI've seen. Thanks to a king in the 15th century who ordered scientiststo develop an alphabet that is easy to learn for increasing alphabetism.In the past there were times when people tried to get rid of Chinesecharacters in Japanese but it never worked out. There was even a dailynewspaper completely in one of the Japanese syllable alphabets. I canunderstand why. Japanese is far easier to skim when you have Kanji inthere. Unfortunately it takes some time to recognize this. That's enough about Japanese. If you want to talk about Japanese, Japan(especially politics or economics) or old video games (8-/16-bit), dropme a mail.

My clothes were doing nothing against the gusts of wind beating against my body. Felt like it wouldn’t be long before I pass out and freeze. Soon I could walk no more and fell to me knees. I couldn’t feel my arms or legs and was certain all hope was lost.

Then I smelled it. Queso and beans filled the air around me. I was nowhere near civilization so where could it be coming from? Next I smelled guacamole, and then sour cream. Somehow the smell was getting closer.

And that is when I saw a figure through the falling snow.

“Who’s there?”

It was hard to see all of him at first. With each footstep his spurs made a clinking sound. The bright red bandana was hard to miss, and then his mustache and brows. His full shape then came into view and he paused.

“What...what are you?”

He was a tall wrapped tortilla. His hands rested on the holsters of his pistoles. And his sombrero was larger than I am. It was El Bandito Burrito.

I was scared when he took a step towards me but I could not move. I don’t know if it was the cold wind or his incredible gaze that struck me still. All I know is I didn’t budge from being on my knees.

Not a word was spoken as he came in close and wrapped his arms around me.  My cheeks felt his tortilla caliente. Even in the freezing cold his body could not chill. A tear escaped my eyes knowing I was warm and safe.

Taking off his sombrero he wrapped it around me. The thing somehow covered my entire body. And out from his head even more warmth spread.

“Th-thank you.”

Feeling was returning to my arms and legs. I wondered if I should try to run, but then I wondered why bother? How far would I get before I lose feeling again? All that mattered is I was safe and alive. Who cares if it was a burrito who saved me? There in his arms, I fell asleep.

Next morning I woke up and the sun was out. The shining warmth filled me with joy and I leaped to my feet in excitement. I looked around and saw I was alone. El Bandito Burrito had stayed with me through la noche and disappeared.

“GRACIAS!!!”

I know not if he was anywhere close enough to hear me. Still I had to try. I never saw him again to express my thanks. And that is my story of how I was saved by El Bandito Burrito.

-----------------------------------------------------------

I’ve been doing a lot of writing this past year. Mostly I write romance short stories, and about a month ago I started writing these quick little mini stories of El Bandito Burrito - fun, ridiculous legends of a character I made up. When I won The Listserve I decided to write a brand new one just for here.

Now I did recently launch a Kickstarter for writing more mini stories with El Bandito Burrito; mostly as a fun way for others to give me ideas as part of an anthology I’m going to publish with 50 stories. I haven’t decided if I’ll include the one above. It might be fun to keep it a Listserve exclusive.

Hopefully you enjoyed it.

Don't worry, I'm not here to raise awareness on safe driving or seat belts. I'm here to communicate my frustration. ""Safer"" cars are a joke. There's no structural design that can fix the fact that our primordial brains are just plainly unfit for driving. That's clear as day from the statistic above. And I say this as a passionate motorcycle driver. You can argue that 20 years ago there was little to do about it and you can't stop progress. Ok. But today we have the technology to build self-driving cars. There's no excuse for having humans still behind the wheel. The problem is that car accidents are seen as unavoidable fatalities. Childs whose families are struck with tragic diseases grow up dreaming to become doctors or researchers. That doesn't happen with car accidents and engineering. There are no campaigns raising funds for building self-driving cars. Governments spend billions to protect from ""threats"", but it took private for-profit companies to make the first prototypes of cars that won't kill you. I'm aware that reality is never like it's supposed to be, that everything is more complex than it seems, that computer vision is definitely a Hard problem. And that self-driving cars will kill (less!) people, too, and there will be outrage. I'm just torn that we could build a solution and we are essentially not doing it.

-> #Smilography

About 5 years ago my grandma heard on the news there weren't many pictures of people smiling. She asked me to change that reality.

How could I refuse a grandma's request? I immediately made a tumblr, a deviantART group and the #Smilography hashtag on G+ (which is where this project still runs kinda on its own).

I'm now asking the Listserve to join and help me change that!

Please use the #Smilography tag whenever you post a photo of a smiling person (be it on Instagram, G+ or Tumblr) and, together, we'll bring the world more smiles.

""Caution - Wet Floor""

I never stood a chance.

My lower extremities perform, faced with the slipperiness of it all. The crowd expects a fall for the Grand Finale. Satisfaction ensues. My lower limbs end the dance with a plié and I feel equilibrium abandoning my company.

The floor is merciless - as always. It hits me with the force of gravity and my weight combined. Math isn’t an ally.

The impact leaves a wound and I lick it. It’s bittersweet. It smells like alcohol.

I was offered a different kind of inebriation that night: an Eau de Cologne composed of delight with a top note of injury. I learned to use it every day and to be eager for it.

The sum of all the caution signs in the world couldn’t have prepared me for this love.   May, 2010

A little over a decade ago, someone told me to let the beauty you see be the thing you do.

That simple statement, scribbled in a note tucked into a book that was being gifted to me, for whatever reason really resonated. At the time I didn't know what I was supposed to do with those words. What beauty did I see? What should I do and how should I do it? These questions existed in my the back of my mind for many years. Admittedly, it took me a few degrees, many conversations with some incredible friends, and a lot of coffee to finally figure out what I think the statement means for me.

I've come to understand that in addition to all of the physical beauty in the world there in also intangible sources of beauty. I see beauty, for example, in acts of kindness, experimentation, cooperation, and moments of joy. I believe, then, the thing for me to do is to use my architectural training and experience to design buildings, places, moments, and things that embody this abstract beauty.

I am sharing this with The Listserve because I want to tell as many people possible that to do this work requires help from people who have needs and/or ideas for projects. Design is only a tool for creatively solving problems. It cannot exist in isolation. It needs people. It needs you - to participate, collaborate, and solicit services. Design requires human input from both designer and client. And with all the beauty that I see, I can't image that there is any shortage of potential clients out there. So, whether you're a small business owner, big developer, or just a regular person with a dream, reach out to a designer. You may be pleasantly surprised at what they have to offer you. 

I would love to connect with anyone that has or knows of a need or idea that could benefit from some architectural design and/or thinking. Get in touch with me via daam-projects[dot]com !  

Thanks so much for listening.

During the vocal percussionist's ""drum"" solo, my wife felt our son kick for the very first time. We told the vocal percussionist about it after the show, and he even tweeted about it. Fast forward a year, and we just got home from another Home Free concert, but this time David is 9 months old. He enjoyed the show tonight even more than he did a year ago, and we had fun talking with the vocal percussionist once again. Upgrading from a husband to also being a father has been an incredible journey, and I am blessed to be sharing it with a wife who is loving, caring, and encouraging.

Though it seems uncommon among the web development crowd I run with, I'm a Christian. The Bible tells us that the Lord calls us to reason together, to study the facts and draw logical conclusions. It then follows that Christians must study and follow the Bible as it says, or real Christianity is lost. The blind, unreasonable hate that has been so overwhelming recently simply doesn't fall in line with real Christianity. Neither does the piecemeal disregard for the laws of God.

Jesus both accepted even the worst offenders without condemning them, and drove the thieves from the House of God with authority. All can see that the character of Jesus is perfect, even if they disagree whether he even existed. If we act like Jesus, we can work together to find ways to make our society more inclusive, more accepting, and safer, all while rooting out intolerance, inequality, and injustice.

Jesus also says that you will find Him, if you search for Him with all your heart. What do you have to lose? If you search with all your heart (a measurement only you can verify), and you do not find Him, then you have proven, at least to yourself, that the Bible cannot be believed. However, if you do find Him, then you have found a friend whose love has no limits.

I thought I'd share a few things I'm passionate about:

-Our bodies are our vessels in this world so why don't we all take care of them? We truly are what we eat and I think that everyone should be conscious of what they decide to put into themselves. Regardless of what you do choose to put into your body, I think it's important that you know what it is and are satisfied with your decision.

-Everyone can dance, if you are having fun and moving your body in any way you want to then you're dancing. It's a beautiful thing that I could not live without. The expression of the human body through dance is amazingly beautiful.

-Humans are like pineapples, sometimes you just have to go upside down to get the juices flowing. (I say this every time I do headstands)

-Being environmentally friendly is not a scary and daunting task. Even just bringing your own bags to the market, opting out of plastic, turning lights off, using mugs and reusable water bottles can do a lot.

-For those of you in countries that can drink from the tap, be appreciative of that fact and don't buy water when it's free.

-I've recently moved from my home on the Big Island of Hawai’i to Chiangmai, Thailand for the second time in my life.

-Let me know if you're interested or have questions about…  -Ayurveda medicine (I eventually will go to school in California for it)  -how to teach others to go “green” and effectively explain that it doesn't have to be hard  -vegan/vegetarian ism ( I have been a vegetarian my whole life and vegan since I was 13)  -Big Island of Hawai’i

  -Chiangmai, Thailand  -yoga  -travelling around Southeast Asia or Europe

Feel free to drop me an email if you're interested in anything I've touched on or just want to have a chat with a 22 year old who's travelling around the world and learning as much as she possibly can. Suggestions of where to go and what to do in countries in SEA or Europe are greatly appreciated. Mahalo a nui loa

It starts with a cause.We eloped in Nepal last January while on a school building trip with a friend’s charity.  They build schools in rural villages and have for 10 years.  In April, the earthquake destroyed a place that hardly had anything to begin with.  In June, we had Seattle wedding.  Instead of a registry we encouraged donations to our friend’s charity.  Google “crowdrise bkrainier” for more info.

The Story:The day my father met my (future) wife was literally a disaster.  He arrived around lunchtime for a father/son weekend.  My sister and mother hadn’t met her yet. I was a week away from telling friends “she’s the one”  (to which they replied “yeah we know”).  First meeting, everyone got along great.   After lunch, she left for friend’s wedding while Dad and I hung out.  Later, he dropped me off to join the wedding and planned a “bachelor night” at my place.  I jokingly muttered, “Don’t burn the house down,” as I exited the car!

We get home post-wedding, Dad’s passed out in the guest room (clothes on) having killed a bottle of wine by himself.  We pass out (clothes off) in my room.  Two hours later, I wake to 11ft high flames coming in the patio window and the smoke detector!  Mind you, we’re on the 3rd floor!  Yelling, running, primal things - you’re not supposed to be in the middle of fires.  I put most of it out with my feet (OUCH!) and a towel, but had to back away for air.  Still naked.  She runs out.  Imagine the sight of a naked 6’4” man jumping up and down amongst flames.  Yelling.  Hot.  Dad trundles upstairs.  Imagine a 5’6 not-small-chested woman jumping around and bending over to put out flames in front of her would-be-father-in-law.  Nice to meet you. The former fireman grabs a trash can, fills it with water, and fire is out.  We find clothes, the fire department arrives, my “non-smoker” Dad admits he smoked, but flushed the butt.  (Logic says he put it out in the too-dry planter, which smoldered for hours until it caught.)  He refused to consider that....  Spontaneous combustion?  Thousands in damage, blisters for weeks, but Dad now likes my girl.

We spend the entire next day together with no mention of the fire!  While leaving for dinner, my beautiful bride decided to pull her jacket out of her disorganized bag.  She says it was laundry day and she was “down to her last pair--the pair you wear on special occasions”.  She exits the room and looks back to see my dad scuffing the floor like a bull… with her red lace thong attached to his white Reebok shoe--must have fallen out while she pulled out her jacket!  Now my dad really likes my girl.

On leaving, he privately says to her with a smirk, “Sorry about all that, and don’t worry, I didn’t see you in AAALLLLL your glory!” wobbling his hands in a showtune presenter fashion.

It’s our own little disaster story.   We alluded to it in our wedding vows.  Crack jokes at the holidays.  Dad doesn’t mention it.  Mom has no idea it happened.  He still “doesn’t smoke”.  We covered the repairs.  Parents.

Lessons: Fire extinguishers.  Smoke detectors.  Water your plants.  Listen to your mother and put on sunblock (I’m 36 and have carcinoma surgery next week).  Love the people who stand by you in the fire.  Acknowledge the elephant in the room.

At the end I have to thanks to Bobuk from the Yandex team who sharedto me and the Russian community “The Listserve” some years ago (I hopehe is still reading The Listserve emails).

I have regrets, for things I didn't do.  I started doing things latein life.  I should have started doing things when I was young andbeautiful.  Now that I'm old and hideous they are more difficult ifnot impossible.  I'm not good at anything but I keep trying.  Things Ienjoy I keep doing even though I am terrible at them.

Inside, someone in a corduroy blazer approached me (my mouth full of smoked gouda) to ask if i was willing to swab my cheek with a q-tip for some stem cell thingamajig. So i said ""sure,” swallowed my Gouda, swabbed my cheek, then promptly forgot about the whole thing. A couple months later a strange email popped up. Apparently this cheek swab had “matched” me with some 27 year old stranger, whose life i was now being asked to save via a blood donation thing. Huh? After roughly 10 seconds of half assed deliberation, I decided to do it. Why not? I took a free train to DC, ran my blood through a crazy Jetsons looking machine for a few hours, and then ate some pretty great free pizza. Overall I'd say the experience, at worst, was mildly inconvenient.

I found out later that this 27 year old man was on his deathbed, but the stem cell blood thingamajig worked, so now he’s a cancer free weightlifter (i get anonymous updates). In my mind, he’s a totally awesome dude who wears brightly colored tank tops. I am not a “life saving” type of person. I don't volunteer. I hate giving blood. I am primarily motivated by free cheese or beer. I knew nothing about stem cell donation or blood cancer or that the two had anything to do with one another.

But this opportunity was essentially handed to me on a platter with some smoked gouda, and now it’s one of my proudest accomplishments. If I do nothing else with my life, at least I helped save the life of one awesome dude who is most definitely wearing a brightly colored tank top right now.

So now that I’ve won the listserve lottery I'm handing you the same opportunity on a virtual cheese platter. Here is some virtual cheese: ??????, now I'm putting on my virtual corduroy blazer and asking you to spend 60 seconds filling out a form on the internet:

OPTION 1 (super easy, this is mandatory): Register to be an organ donor:>>>ORGANIZE [dot] ORG<<<No swabs or blood or anything like that, and this company lets you do it online in less than 60 seconds (no DMV visit necessary). This is by far the easiest way to accidentally save a life.

OPTION 2 (slightly more work): You can do the same cheek swabby thing i did at home:>>>DELETEBLOODCANCER [dot] ORG<<<They will send you a swab kit, and if you're lucky you'll get matched. There's a 99% chance you won't, but at least you'll feel good for trying. Note: i don’t think they send cheese.

OPTION 3 (for the totally hardcore): You can register to be a “living donor,” which means you’d be willing to give a kidney to someone who desperately needs it if you were a match. Admittedly, this is a little too heroic for my taste, but maybe some of you guys are that awesome? It's easy to find a transplant center in your area if you want to be a total badass:>>> GOOGLE: ""SRTR"" THEN CLICK ""FIND A TRANSPLANT CENTER"" <<<

December 2015,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/12/18/surviving-neglect-witnessing-abused-and-perpetuating-violence/,"December 2015, 18","Surviving neglect, witnessing abused and perpetuating violence.","I have spent the majority of these 30+ years of my life actively hiding at least most of my story from the world. At least a dozen of those years spent trying to understand my own story. Recently, I’ve been thinking about ways to actually tell my story. All along I’ve wished to be seen and heard, though the thought of such vulnerability is terrifying to me.

I’m a survivor. I come from a family of survivors. I also come from a culture of abuse, a pervasive culture that appears to have a hold on the very core of everyone in my family across many generations. It’s strange, knowing my story has no exceptions while still feeling truly unique. I don’t remember the things I witnessed; I recall some of my own violent and corrosive acts; and I cannot explain how every single one of my cousins and I almost appear to communicate telepathically.

Perhaps even after over a decade of space and time and healing we are just so conditioned to think and experience in such specific ways that we just do - something that feels simultaneously acutely oppressive and significantly comforting. I decided to study psychology the first time I heard the phrase “cognitive dissonance.” I sometimes wonder how I will go through life once I no longer have these people in my life, even after years physically away from each other.

- Complex relationships with touch, with intention- Nightmares of zombies- Almost twin-speak type phrases- Desires for entrepreneurship, coupled with a crushing fear of failure- Triggers including practicing hobbies or physical strain- Love of horror movies

So many things many – sometimes all – of us share, some more exclusive than others. It’s always surprising, but makes complete sense to learn of something new. I think one of the only reasons anything is surprising stems from the complete lack of communication we participated in and experienced throughout childhood.

I went to a workshop for survivors a few months ago. The last question we discussed was “What do you wish had happened?” This wasn’t about any abuse or neglect itself. The question was really: “What do you wish had happened after (or during) the things you survived?”

Discussion. Disclosure. Reconciling the multiple realities within which each member of my family lived. I do remember a happy childhood. There are some very wonderful things I was able to do, places I was able to visit, aspects of myself I was able to explore. I take none of this for granted. I am also proud of my resilience. Sometimes my cousins and I joke about how we wish we could be 8 again, without a worry in the world. The truth is that each of us had plenty to worry about back then. And now, as an adult, responsibility is *that* much more exhausting.

I do believe that had I understood the work I was already doing, even if that work never changed…had we been making conscious choices rather than reacting, even if that was just a fraction of the time…if my education and my family’s education encompassed feminism, anti-racism and social justice before half of us became parents, it wouldn’t have taken this long to start to feel like things *might* be ok. I’m so tired, but I’m hopeful. Years and years have made me feel stone, but within just months I’ve started to feel nostalgic and emotional sometimes by just a simple text message.

I wonder if anyone in my family is on this listserve… I guess I will soon find out.

Nan is my 79-year-old grandma.  Growing up I would always tell people- your life will not be complete until you meet my grandma.

She is for a lack of better words, absolutely crazy.  Not crazy in the, old lady, not really sure what’s going on crazy.  But the knock your socks off, make you pee your pants crazy.  Here are a few of her most prevailing traits-

- She swears constantly- She has literally given me a speech on how the ‘F’ word is not a swear word (Using the Lord’s name, however, is)- She can without a doubt drink beer (Coors light 10oz cans- because the 10oz taste better) faster than anyone, regardless of gender, that I have ever met.- She will be the first person to let you if you have gained a single pound and exactly where that little extra love has gone.   Sometimes she makes you get on the scale and hovers as she asks “Are you up or are you down?”- She has given me the middle finger more times than I could ever begin to count.  Her favorite saying being “I think you’re number one.”- She will tell you exactly how she feels about anything, or what she did that day, or worse- what she did when she was younger no matter how inappropriate.   (i.e. why she doesn’t blame Monica for what may or may not have happened with the former Prez)

And let me tell you, all these things make her hilarious.  Every single one is done with a laugh.  Her intentions are pure.   She would give you the shirt off her back, her very last dollar, her right arm and all those clichés that explain just how selfless someone can be.  Yes- she gives me the up down every time I walk in to her presence, but she always tells me how beautiful I am.  Her house has a revolving door and an almost constant flow of family and friends.  She is the apex of a rather large family, all of which have spent nights crashing on her living room floor.  She still gets excited for happy hour at her house on Friday’s after work where everyone stands around her in the kitchen sharing endless laughs.  I can feel the love when I walked through the door.

Last week Nan was put in the hospital.  It’s possible that she may not make it out for Christmas Eve, an absolute chaotic slew of family and friends held at her house that no one has ever missed.  My heart hurts as I write this.  At the same time, I am so thankful that she has been such a significant part of my life.  It feels good to have so many great memories.  I have never had to be anybody other than myself around her and I know her love for me is identical to the love I feel for her.

Let me just leave you with a few #shitnansays

- Seasonings Greetings (Seasons Greetings)- Motorvate (motivate)- Guatemala (guacamole)- Progalong cheese (provolone)

In her words, Goodnight Irene.

And what exactly is wrong with that? What if your dream is to help someone else fulful their dream? What if it's a common dream? If everyone was to follow their own unique version then nobody would get anywhere. The fact is that most dreams need both leaders and followers.

For a long time now my dream has been to be financially independent, running a company which allows me the freedom to work whenever and wherever I please. After about 10 years of working towards this goal, I'm yet to achieve it.

I regularly have ideas for products. These are usually websites but sometimes physical things. Every time inspiration strikes I write down the idea and set it aside to reevaluate at a future date. Every few months I pick a new idea to develop. Here are a few ideas I've had (these names are not usually what I call the finished product):- Admoji - an emoji/emoticon chat plugin featuring sponsored emojis. Advertisers offer their own emojis (think a smiling face holding a Cocacola can) and pay out based on impressions (eyeballs). You can earn money for yourself or your favourite charity based on the number of times your emoji is viewed.- Revisit - Reddit meets Google Analytics - a site owner installs a tag on their site which logs how many times a specific user visits. Sites are then ranked on a central site showing content (articles, pages, images etc) ranked on metrics such as length of visit or return visits.- Tea/coffee alarm - a clip on thermometer which you attach to your tea/coffee mug which alerts you when the liquid drops to your perfect temperature (this can be changed to suit each person).- Clipjoin - crowdsourced Youtube compilations. Users upvote short (<5 sec) Youtube clips or vine videos in a similar style to Reddit. The top 10/20 are automatically combined into 'compilations' and featured on the homepage.- LocalPlaylist - a personalised concert recommendation engine. A Spotify app which matches your favourite tracks against playlists submitted by local DJs/clubs. It then recommends events to you based on what is likely to be played on the night.I'm not sure which (if any) of these projects I'll choose to work on next but I'd appreciate any feedback/ideas. If you're interested in things I've worked on before then you can Google 'freeblogging me' and 'Rapipad notepad'. I'd also appreciate feedback on these projects too. Feel free to incorperate any of the above in your own ideas.

Here are some things I've learned:The idea is the easiest part. The implementation and the marketing are the hardest.""Build it and they will come"" is a fallacy. Marketing is just as important as implementation if not more so (at least at the beginning).You can have a relatively successful site which gets thousands of visits per day and make very little money - nowhere near enough to live on. In most cases, 'Banner ads' is not necessarily a very good business model.I now find myself working for an international conglomerate. Strangely it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I actually quite enjoy my job. I can now understand why so many other people have a regular 9-5. Nowadays I have less time now to work on my side projects. I find myself wondering how many other people have settled favour of a secure job, eventually running out of time and energy to chase their real dream.

Over the past 2 years or so, I have attempted many times to plan what I would write to 20K+ people from all over the world. I often imagined how excited I’d be when I received that email. But when I opened the email, it was a nonchalant event. I remember thinking “oh”; and a few hours later, thought “oh crap”.

When I was filling out the survey from Chris on Evolving the Listserve, I got hung up on the question “What do you know most about?” Suddenly I felt like I don’t know much about anything. I manage corporate strategy and run analytics in my day job, but does putting that down make me interesting? Do I know anything well enough (outside work) that I can teach others?

Speaking of work, Kobe Bryant’s recent retirement announcement inspired me to start thinking about professional success. In a way, he has it easier than most people – his success is defined by clear metrics: points, wins, championships. I don’t have the privilege of having numbers to measure my career, so I’m still searching for the answer, if there ever will be one.I feel that measurement is a part of human nature. People buy wearables (smartwatches, fitness bands) so that they can assess how well they are doing, but unfortunately the most important things usually cannot be measured: quality connections and relationships with others, positive impact on the world, etc. I don’t know whether measuring these things is a matter of utmost importance, but I do think that if we could ever put a metric on them, we will be more focused on achieving “success” in those areas, instead of focusing on numbers that may not bring long-lasting happiness, such as higher salaries (see Easterlin Paradox).

I love traveling. This year I went to Spain and Portugal, and next year I am planning to go to Iceland and Czech Republic (please send recommendations!). Also, if any of you are ever in the San Francisco Bay Area, my roommate and I are happy to host you on Couchsurfing (username: sbwpchen).

If you made it this far, thank you! I have a small favor to ask. Recently I started a blog to talk about beverages from the Pacific Northwest (Oregon and Washington). If you have a minute, please take a look and send over your feedback! I’d love to hear your thoughts. The blog is at pacnwbrew[dot]com.

We are a new kind, my generation that is. We  are plugged into eternal limbo. We are the first to live in many dimensions at once. We are an elusive sort. Chasing us can be challenging, for our greatest presence is not in the physical world that you know. Find us by looking through the lens of the screen rather than the pupils of your human eyes. We have abandoned the flesh to mold ourselves into pixels, each one painstakingly planned. We ignore that which we’ve lost in translation.

Alive, yes we are alive, pulsing with the energy of a brightened backlight, a buzzing hard drive, impulses like an electric shock. Search engines have become microcosms of our scattered minds. Stimulation is constant, fingers drag along a cold glass screen, eyes gorge themselves on endless information. Images come in surplus in this generation. One word can multiply into millions. One phrase can incite a revolution instantaneously.

We have no private life in this generation. We are everywhere and nowhere. We have eyes embedded in our hands, and the public has become a part of our constant reality. Broadcasting space used to be for getting vital information out. What happens when you give infinite broadcasting space, when you open a new dimension with a capacity to hold ideas, musings, etc. to any person on earth? What happens when humanity creates what is essentially a new world, decorated with endless museums, podiums, stages, available for anyone who deems themselves worthy to display themselves and wait for applause? We've leveled the plane between the commoner and the famous. We’ve shrunk the earth so we can hold it in the palm of our hands.

Sitting on a thrown of “likes”, we fall in love with altered,crafted versions of ourselves. We embody the modern Narcissus. When you sit down with one of us, try to break through our hypnotized eyes we might not be really there.

They always say, write about what you know. What I know is that in this way of life our social skills are dissolving into screens. I have often imagined a world where one does not ever need to leave their own home because the internet has everything: friends, relationships, entertainment, echoes of the life we are not living.

What I know is that my generation is on the brink of something terrible and something wonderful— A surface level interconnectedness that humanity has never seen before but also a psychological isolation that becomes even more prevalent with every app, every device that consumes our attention. I fear that one day many of us will have our lives flash before our eyes only to see brand names, advertisements, and pixels rather the transient, breathing, fleshy world that we could've been experiencing.

I spend three hours a day cut off from the world, alone, underwater (aka college swimming)... This time is spent entertaining ideas~ about mind/body connection, my generation, what the inside of my brain looks like (metaphorically of course).

My name's is Constantin and I'm a 30 year old guy living in Bangkok, Thailand. I was born in Germany, but lived in the US, Austria and now I'm living in the big mango in the land of smile.

I work as a Ruby on Rails programmer for a company called Oozou (we are hiring!) and I'm very happy with how my life is going! :)

While living here, I've started dating a girl and we've moved in together - Waew is Thai, went to a very good university to study to pursuit her dream to become a chef and together we now plan to open our own little restaurant in Bangkok. But we don't have a name yet!

Do you know what we should call it? It's going to be a small (10-15 guests only) restaurant that will focus on organic, local and seasonal food - we plan to show where everything came from - and work with local farmers to provide the best possible ingredients. Maybe we will even offer free tours to the farms for our guests! It's not going to be a specific cuisine - just a daily menu based on what Waew can get off the market and farmers.

Currently I'm in Laos doing an off-road motorbike trip with three friends of mine. I've started all kind of sports that got me out of my comfort zone when I moved here: I'm skydiving (getting my A license soon!), started diving (again) and now love to ride bikes - on- and off-road!

And let me tell you: there is definitely no better way to explore a country than off-road on two wheels. You won't believe the things we see - in just one day: little villages of hill-tribes in the mountains, all the children running to the street to great us, laughing and jumping around! Chickens, piglets, dogs, cats, cows, elephants, goats and everything in between!

We always try to stay in guest houses - nothing too fancy - and always just stay for one night.

I've done this in Thailand a couple of times (around Chiang Mai) and now Laos.

Email me if you have any questions about Thailand, riding bikes, getting into skydiving or - and that would be really cool - if you have a name for the restaurant!

Thank you!

I had only gotten my license a month before, and this was the longest I’d ever driven. The first two hours were easy. Then the roads got smaller, until we were driving on a winding dirt road filled with potholes and loose rocks and rattling washboard stretches. Finally we were at the trailhead, loading up my backpack with both water bottles. I had volunteered to carry everything. My legs were having trouble getting into any kind of rhythm, and I kept knocking the toes of my boots on rocks. But I felt proud when she asked me to slow down a little.The trail started to climb. I wanted to stop in the shade and have some water, but I didn’t want to be the one to ask. Neither did she. We had that in common. Finally, she asked for her water bottle. I drank slowly so we could rest for a moment in the dappled shade. We didn’t say much, just a few words about how hot it was and how we hoped we were getting close to the top. She was tough, and I was trying to grow up to be tough too. My head pounded with each step, and I tried not to look up at how high the trail climbed. She was silent, but every time I turned she wasn’t far behind.

We crested a ridge, at last, and the valley lay before us. Below us were bright green meadows and slopes stitched together with clear-running streams. That’s what I imagined Eden might have looked like, filled with life and beauty and a little bit of violence. I saw a marmot sunning itself on a rock. It raised its head and cried out at me, eyes squinting and jaws open wide, showing teeth.

I walked past a boulder, and there were two mountain goats staring back at me. The first was young, hornless, half-jumping on gangly legs. It was white and fluffy, and walked jerkily toward me. Its mother studied me more carefully. She had two wickedly sharp black horns, and her fur was shaggier, matted and brown near her underbelly. Her eyes were black and still. She took a few steps toward me and herded the young one back. My mother warned me too, and I backed away slowly.

Seeing her climbing up the last section of rocks before the lake, I somehow knew that this would be the last time we did something like this together. I wanted her to see the lake first, and she did. She stopped at the top of the boulder pile and waited for me. A breeze was riffling the surface of the lake, breaking the mirror sheen I’d seen in photos. But the real lake had its own wild, rough-edged beauty.

The water was gray, reflecting the mountain behind it and the sky above it. I walked along the shoreline. She stayed behind, sipping from her water bottle. I picked my way along the rocks, stumbling when they shifted underfoot. A few times she looked like she was saying something, but if she was I couldn’t hear it. I waved to her, but she was looking somewhere else. I let my hand drop and walked back to her. We sat quietly for a moment. Then we got up and she led the way back to the car.

It's a hard choice to make, especially in the age of an internet which famously never forgets. Googling my name still results in pictures and news articles from years ago. It'd be nice to move on, to have my public presence match who I am and what I'm doing now, rather than essentially having been frozen in time by a particular event.At the same time, I can't support those who seek to completely wash away the past. So many societal injustices have been perpetuated and then swept under the rug in the name of ""moving on"" while the effects linger for generations. So many abusers have been given free reign to continue their actions unchecked because no one will talk about them. On some level it's critical that we own the past and acknowledge the legacy it has left us.

I'm just not sure where to draw the line. Easy access to global information has been a mixed blessing and curse: it's that much easier to get people involved, but it's also that much easier for people to involve themselves. I've seen amazing outpourings of support for worthy causes, but I've also seen the incredible harm that internet mobs and crusades can cause. A lot of the time there isn't even a clear distinction between the two: the fringe elements of an otherwise benevolent endeavour can be downright scary.

I don't regret the choice I made, I'm just sad I had to make it.

There's no perfect solution to this problem. We're all individual people with imperfect knowledge. The world is a very diverse place with many different cultures and value systems; trying to enforce one upon the others would create more problems than it would solve. But we can try to avoid being callous. We can try to empathize, even when we disagree. We can try to better understand the ways in which new technology might impact our society and how we can manage that impact responsibly.

My own explorations in this area have lead to a rather ironic result: I work for the very company whose search result pages remain a portrait of my former self -- on social privacy and harassment prevention. Go figure. At the end of the day, I hope I can help create a world in which fewer people have to be sad about their options.

One of the most important things in doing what I do is having a diverse set of experiences and perspectives to draw upon. I'd love to hear yours.

My colleague proceeded to tell me that my choice was very odd as my hero doesn’t hold typical celebrity status many choose in their heroes.  My hero to me is famous as he won a ground breaking human rights complaint brought against Australia before the United Nations Human Rights Committee.  The complaint lead to decriminalisation of ‘sodomy’ in Australia, or in my mind the decriminalisation of simply being gay.  You would think that my home country of Australia would learn something from my hero’s work in 1994, yet in recent years Australia has been forwarding asylum seekers who land in Australia to Papua New Guinea (PNG) where being homosexuality remains a crime.  My government knowingly transfers asylum seekers into risky environments, where death is possible, and somehow believe this is okay.  The subject of this email is from an Iranian who sought asylum in Australia, and the Australian government forwarded him to PNG where his existence would yet again be criminalised.  When he found out he would face similar persecution in PNG as what he faced in Iran, he no longer felt like he was being given any type of asylum.  I write this not to shame Australia, but to remind people that seemingly forward thinking countries continue to persecute minorities and asylum seekers.  The Australian government’s third-country processing of asylum seekers greatly saddens me, and I wish I knew what it takes to be someone else’s hero in this situation.

Really. I do. Email  and I'll see what I can do. I hope to respond to any and every email I get.

Feel free to ask for literally anything you need help with! I don't want you to feel constrained by not knowing who I am or what I'm good at. But in the interest of (partial) transparency: I might be 30 by the time you read this; I've lived in DC and Brooklyn, mostly; I wish I had a dog but I don't; I frequently wonder what it would take to start a career as a ghost hunter; I'm a very slow writer.

A few things I'm confident I can help you with:-Decisions. I'm super opinionated and I'll gladly cast the tiebreaker vote on anything you're debating, with yourself or with another living thing. -Advice. Because that's what we're here for. -Writing/editing/proofreading/copyediting. I do this for a living. I can also tell you the difference between the last three.-Research. If it's out there, I will find it. This goes for serious things and for silly things. -Ideas about what you should do with your hair.-Very easy soup recipes.-Book recommendations.

But please, really, ask for whatever. If I can't help, maybe I know someone who can! And I'm genuinely, earnestly looking for opportunities to volunteer in my community, so if you're an organizer in NYC, I'd like to know more about what you're organizing.

If you'd like to know how this whole thing turns out, email  and I'll send over a link so you can subscribe to a newsletter I'll use exactly once, to report back about how this experiment has gone.

December 2015,07,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/12/07/one-thousand-eight-hundred-degrees/,"December 2015, 07",One Thousand Eight Hundred Degrees,"Fahrenheit, that is. It’s the temperature required to melt bronze — an alloy composed mostly of copper and a sprinkle of other ingredients. Not unlike the oxygen we breathe or the water that lives within the cells of our bodies, bronze at one time had a close relationship to humankind from birth to death. It’s more than a metal. It’s something to be respected. Perhaps even revered.

I spent many nights and early mornings working as a student monitor in the UC Santa Cruz foundry and metal shop, entering at night with a backpack full of PowerBars and Redbulls, and emerging when the sun came up, clanging shut the workshop doors with my clothes speckled with wax and an array of tiny burns. In the foundry, we would spend the first half of each semester building shapes in wax. I would sit quietly in the shop, imagining what my final sculpture would look like from the top, from the side. Would I be able to fit my fingers around it? How heavy would it be? Would it require two hands to hold, or one?

We melted wax into sheets, and added it chunk by chunk to a blob of wax. A sculpture would reveal itself. Was this the image I had in my head? Was I happy with this work? I knew that the wax would be replaced with bronze and be locked into existence for thousands of years. This object would outlive countless generations of my own family — this is an indisputable fact. Would I be proud of what I made here?

Twice each semester the entire art department would gather, like a tribe to a fire, to witness “the pour”. A crane lowered a crucible full of glowing liquid metal, like a bowl of stars, and pour the bronze into our molds one by one. And like that my piece transformed from a delicate shape of wax — so quick to disintegrate with the smallest dose of sunlight — to a thirty-five pound hunk of bronze.

Metal sculpture taught me the importance of having a strong imagination and vision. Vision is the ability to understand and take ownership of your present, to clearly see your future objective, and to plot a course backward outlining the steps you need to follow. I learned that without a mastery of vision, sculpture is impossible.

Leonardo da Vinci’s biographer, Giorgio Vasari, said, “he taught us that men of genius sometimes accomplish most when they work least, for they are thinking out inventions and forming in their minds the perfect ideas which they subsequently express and reproduce with their hands”. He used vision when developing scuba gear, crossbows and parachutes.

In Walden, Henry David Thoreau encourages imagination as a starting point when we says, “If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them.” It’s within one’s ability to plot a series of practical, actionable steps from the future to the present where vision demonstrates its power.

In my career and in life, I challenge myself to use vision to define my future. Where do I see myself in two years? Ten? What activities, causes and achievements will bring me a sense of fulfillment? Then, following Thoreau’s words, I devote each day to building that foundation, one brick at a time.

Sculpture and vision are one in the same - it’s simply a process of crafting the future, starting with today.

Of course, I left this submission to the last possible minute which means that you're about to read a stream of thoughts that go through my mind on a daily basis. Thinking of something worthy to say to an audience this large is...daunting, to say the least. But then again, who determines worth, and should I even care? That's thought #1.

I'm a senior nursing student. This is my last year of school before I enter the ""real world"" where my decisions, I've been told, suddenly become super important. This leads me to thought #2: what the heck am I going to do with my life? I mean, I know I'm going to be a nurse, which I'm really excited about, but I don't want my career to dictate who I am. The decision of where to move after I graduate is overwhelming. I can literally go anywhere...any suggestions? I feel like my life up until this point has just been a huge preparation for this moment. And yet, thought #3, I feel like I don't know a thing.

During my time in college, I have learned how easily we box each other, and ourselves, in to fit certain criteria/explanations in our brains. When I first started college, I was in over my head. I struggled to succeed, letting myself fuel my own misinformed perceptions about how poorly I must have been doing compared to everyone else. I kept myself in that box for a long time, and let my perceptions of others' expectations of me tighten that box even more. This led to my feeling inadequate a lot of the time-- academically, socially, religiously, you name it. I often felt like I wasn't meeting certain standards (who set them, I never really knew). I only recently learned that I wasn't the only one who had the same concerns and negative self-perceptions, just no one talked about it (google New York Times article on the Penn Face-- those struggles are real). I still somehow managed to stay afloat, but most of the time it felt like I was drowning in my perceived inabilities. Over time, with a lot of help and sleep (clinicals = sleep deprivation), I've gained some clarity. Which leads me to thought #5, something I tell myself every day: Keep perspective. A lot easier said than done. The society I live in sets the stakes really high, and the pressures are looming everywhere. Thought #6: What does it mean to be successful? After all, doesn't everyone just want to be happy? Thought #7: What does it mean to be happy? Thought #8: I guess I'll figure it out. Thought #9: The world is a freaking scary place right now: are our foci misguided?

Thought #10: I joined an a cappella group this year. Best decision I have made in my college career. I'm honestly just grateful that they took me even though I'm a senior! The Shabbatones (yes, we love Jewish puns) are not only talented, but they have become my family. I don't mind that we practice 6 hours a week with crazy schedules, because I love every second of it and it makes all my stress melt away, which is pretty magical for me.

I'm 18 years old, taking a gap year before I start college next fall and I have no real idea of what I want to do for the rest of my life. Sorry, I don't have any incredible stories, nothing extraordinary had happened to me yet. 

I've recently discovered there are websites where you can anonymously talk to strangers. This was pretty crazy to me because I didn't use social media as a kid. It's fascinating, I've never before gotten the chance to encounter so many people, even if it's only text-based. Although there was an overwhelming number of people who just wanted to tali about sex, I did get to meet some interesting individuals. I talked to someone in France, the day after the attacks. They had been celebrating their birthday at a restaurant near one of the bombings and now feels guilty for surviving. I met an Australian male stripper. A young women in North Korea broke me down to tears with her descriptions of the horrors of the famine happening there. I got to debate parallel universe theories with a man in Sweden and discuss the meaning of life with someone in Michigan.What I love most about it is that you skip the small talk and dive straight into the important things, really connect to someone. It's the anonymity that allows that, I think. I'm rather unintimidating when I'm just words on a screen, so people just say what they feel. 

On one particular site you can post a question for others to answer. Two people get matched together at a time, to discuss your question, but you can't contribute to their conversation, only watch. Oftentimes people post disgustingly rude things in the question section. I was astounded by the amount of hatred and racism. It's unreal.So I started posting my own things. Just nice little messages in hopes of brightening peoples' days. Some were shocked at the kindness, which I found deeply disturbing, the fact that genuinely pleasant words from a stranger was rare and not something to be expected. Some people respond with angry, resentful words and call me vile names. I still don't know why. The whole anonymous factor, probably. The best is when people say, ""I needed this"" or ""I'm having a rough time and this made me feel a little better."" That's what makes it worth it. If I can make a difference in a few people's lives, even in this tiny way, then I'm going to continue doing it. At least until I figure out a way to reach people better. I guess where I'm going with this is you never know when someone might need your concern, or patience, or love.

Have a wonderful day/night! Take care!------Send me an email if you want to talk about things I mentioned, or anything else in general. Space, books, food, religion, just want to rant, anything's fine!

I've been thinking recently about friendship. As a single guy (blaming the single status on being gay, stats not in my favour haha) who's friend's are mostly in relationships, I've been wondering where I slot into their life's...will I always be the 2nd choice? For example, if my best friend(s) is looking to go travelling, he will always turn to his girlfriend as first choice. Doesn't make me feel great about myself but not really a situation I can do much about! Anyone else ever find themselves in a simalar position? 

Anyhow, I don't think I've much more to add that I haven't seen on here before. If anyone would like to know more about me, please get in touch.

Look around your home. Every object you see was created by individuals who made a series of decisions — what materials/shapes to use, what functionality to include, how those objects would make you feel.

The things we bring into our life form a huge part of our day-to-day experience in the world. You can choose to stock up on poorly-made products, or you can consciously consider each object you acquire based on its value, and the values, that it helps you think of when you use it.

Well-made products help us live better, more thoughtfully, more intuitively, in ways we often can’t intellectually perceive, but we just *know*. To me, that’s the magic of design and creativity — through the things we make, we have the power to help us all lead better lives. Shoutout to Patagonia, MUJI, Apple and countless others who get this.

We live in interesting times – rife with terrorism, police brutality, climate change, and more.

These are all just large-scale manifestations of personal human struggles. Worrying about politics and the “system” without addressing the root cause — ourselves — is a band-aid solution. After all, a society is just a collection of individuals. Change yourself first, and the world follows.

There’s a parable I love:

One evening, an old Cherokee Indian told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside people. He said, ‘My son, the battle is between two ‘wolves’ inside us all. One is Evil. It is anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.

The other is good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.’

The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather: ‘Which wolf wins?’The old Cherokee simply replied, ‘The one you feed.’

-

In any scenario you face, you can *choose* how to react. Decision by decision, we create the world. Here’s to our new wolfpack of ~23,000.

~ ~ ~

What would you do if money were no object?

With huge technological changes afoot, we face multiple possible futures.

Behind door #1 is the status quo — massive structural unemployment caused by technology, growing inequality/poverty, and millions living in the rat race under a single-minded pursuit of economic profit at all costs.

Behind door #2 lies the total freedom to pursue our passions, do work we love, and enjoy fulfilling lives, using the technology we’ve built to power the system. Sounds pretty good?

The concept is Universal Basic Income (UBI) — a basic living wage, paid to every citizen, allowing us to eliminate poverty and choose the kind of life we each want to pursue. It’s *crazy* that we have the power to make this happen in the next 10-15 years. I encourage you to look up “Basic Income Action”, join the movement early, and get involved.

~ ~ ~

Whether it’s the objects we use and create, the way we live and react in every moment, or the society we build, we hold immense power — we get to decide which wolf to feed. Let’s be mindful of those choices.

December 2015,02,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/12/02/new-rules/,"December 2015, 02",New Rules,"The New Rules of Marriage by Terrence Real - DISCLAIMER: The summary of this book on Amazon is enough to turn you off from ever reading this book (If you are a man). Don’t be fooled, read on.

My wife and I have been going through a rough spot.  After 10+ years of marriage I started to feel more and more controlled and unloved.  Our fights had become more frequent and instead of resolution it seemed like we just talked the issue to death.  We had always been of a single mind that we were fully committed to one another and nothing could change that.  Then it began to feel helpless and eventually started looking like divorce.  I began to rationalize that I would just be happier that way and so would she.  Another contributor to this is that my teenage son become estranged deciding that he doesn’t need to listen to anyone anymore; we had become more of a nuisance than anything else.  While he was struggling for freedom to live his own life, my wife and I were figuring out how to let go in healthy productive ways.  He had developed substance abuse issues and we were trying to get him back on his feet.  I developed a lot of resentment.  Here we are trying to figure out how to give him more independence while I was feeling like I couldn’t have any of my own!  My family was in turmoil and I was losing my best friend.  The worst part was I couldn’t even see it, and denied that I couldn’t see it.

During a therapy session our therapist recommended The New Rules of Marriage.  Thankfully I didn’t read the Amazon description. I think if I had I NEVER would have even cracked the cover.  This book spoke to me in a way that nothing else had.  I could finally see the real problems in our relationship. It wasn’t her at all, but the way I had come to perceive her (Core negative image).  The most important thing of all though was this book spells out a set of rules for our relationship that I can actually live by!  Being able to ask for what you want and get it in a healthy way.  How to listen AND respond, setting limits, and oddly enough how to accept what you ask for.  It works for me because, for example, getting what you want is the responsibility of both people (not just one).

For an example my wife wanted me to take her on dates.  She had asked for this many times and I never seemed to deliver, certainly never with any consistency (if at all).  When she asked again, this time, I knew the steps.  As we walked through the process, it became clear that my idea of a date and hers were different!  After clarifying that it could be as simple as a dinner out, it all seemed so easy.  I was overthinking everything and was paralyzed with indecision.  Now that I knew what she wanted I told her that finding and securing a babysitter was something I hated doing.  She was all too willing to help with that if I would just plan the date.  WIN

I wish I could convey all the wonderful things that have begun happening with us now. We can communicate effectively and stop assuming the worst of each other.  Whether you are in a relationship or not, I feel like this book can give you the rules for creating a healthy relationship; a set of rules you can actually live by.

Four weeks ago my brother passed away on the Tuesday night and my mom passed away on the Thursday morning.  Kind of ordinary deaths in a month of extra-ordinary death.  Ordinary in the greater scheme of things but not quite so ordinary for me - or for them.  

I find it hard to grieve and I find it hard that I feel relieved.  

For mom it was what she has wanted for a while now, as she said ""growing old is not for sissies"".  For my brother Geoff though, he was 100% when he went in, apparently they had to rush to remove his stomach because of cancer.  I suggested he get a second opinion and maybe not rush but he was quite upbeat, only expected to be in for a week or two.  They discovered that it was pointless doing the operation.  Three months of agony in hospital, basically in a coma the whole time, and he is gone. They should have waited for the test results.  Kind of think they messed that one up but hey, they got paid.  I think death is better than what he was going through. 

I am going to miss them.

November 2015,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/11/29/no-subject/,"November 2015, 29",[no subject],"My father is crazy, he is eccentric and self-absorbed but he is also funny and loving. As a child he would always tuck us in and say ‘good night, I love you, don’t get married until your thirty’, seeing as though he and my mother were married and divorced very young I think he only had my bed interest at heart. As a kid people always told me I was going to look like him when I grew up and I would cry for hours because I thought that meant I was going to go bald, with side tufts of hair that stick out like a Koala, and grow a beard. I learnt way later than I should have that as a girl this was unlikely to happen. We weren’t that close in my teenage years as many fathers and daughters aren’t. He would try to reason with me that when I didn’t clean my room that it hurt his feelings and being a moody teenager I did not give two hoots about his feelings being hurt because I left the milk out.

It was only when I hit my mid-twenties that I realised he was actually a wonderful character who I could learn a lot from. For starters he is incredibly intelligent but also very silly, he is not allowed to play trivial pursuit with the family as he knows way too much but on the same hand is silly enough to try to bludge a smoke of a man in a parking lot who had threatened him 5 minutes earlier that he would steal my father’s car if he did not give him $5 euros.

He is stylish, as a child he would always dress me in ‘the latest styles from London’ or whatever that meant, he seems to always be ahead of the times in his dress and once when we were out at a restaurant for dinner he left went to the shop 2 doors down, bought a shirt and changed in to it because he did not feel “hip” enough. But for someone so stylish he can be so very uncool when he starts shouting and running through a train station because we may miss the train that leaves in half an hour or even worse someone could be sitting in our assigned seats. Safe to say he does not deal well under pressure and I saw that even more recently when he was trying to write my brother’s wedding speech. In the end it was a good speech even if he did use a line from the film gladiator.

If you’ve actually bothered to read this far you’re probably wondering why I’ve dedicated this opportunity to my dad and the reason is because after everything I’ve written he is still a small town man, who has lived in his hometown all his life, built the home we live in and spend his nights on the couch buying things from eBay he doesn’t need, I want to make him as great as I believe he is and having people from all over the world read about him, gives me one slight chance to do that. Also because, on a recent holiday in Europe I was frantically running through the station to board the euro star pushing pensioners and children out of my way in a panic that I would miss the train and I realised I was in fact not only looking more like him every day but acting like him as well…. and I was proud.

November 2015,28,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/11/28/a-s-l/,"November 2015, 28",A/S/L?,"I spent the first shy 21 years of my life dating disastrously and thinking that I would be forever alone. Until one day, I met a guy who I finally seemed to connect to. Problem was, he was 5146* miles away... (*according to Google maps)

Back in April 2009, I spent an evening procrastinating. My best friend Rona suggested I try Omegle, which at the time, was a simple video-less messenger website for strangers to talk to each other. Conversations were assigned randomly. One conversation started, not with demands of “A/S/L?”, or even what I was wearing but with a fairly normal interaction. I was studying film at university; he was working on some independent films in LA, where he lived. ""Wow"", I thought - ""He might be a great contact to have!""

Back then, the Omegle website was temperamental and conversations used to be cut off all the time. I often wonder what would have happened if we had been cut off before we had the chance to exchange our full names. Perhaps there is a parallel universe in which this happened – I wouldn’t even recall this now as a significant event, and my life would have taken many different turns instead.

We then proceeded to talk for a minimum 4 hours a day. It just felt so easy. I deliberately didn't tell anyone at first- I didn't want to overreact.

I had to go away to a place with hardly any Internet connection for a week, two weeks after we met. I laid on the hotel bed and felt physically sick because I missed him so much. I also felt confused- how could I miss someone I had never met?

Gradually, we told people about the other. Reactions varied, but my best friend Karen told me to go for it. My parents got used to me sitting talking to this boy on the other side of the world.

Nearly 3 months after we met, I flew over to LA for 2 weeks. I remember when I was sitting on the plane, thinking “WHAT AM I DOING?!”

When we first hugged, he was shaking.

First week was a little awkward and we just acted as friends and got to know each other, but we got over it in the 2nd week. After going home in tears, we realized we loved each other. And that was it, for 2 years, going back and forth, visiting each other every 2-4 months.

I tried to move over there and applied for a student visa, but got rejected. I started to feel like this could be the end of the line for us. There comes a point where it becomes too painful to be apart, it needs to be all or nothing.

But then, he did some research and realised he could get a British passport due to family background. Moved over and been here for 4 years now.

When living the everyday normalcy of our lives, I have to remind myself of our beginnings, and how amazing our connection across the world was.

People are surprised when I say I'm not sure I believe in ""fate"".

I think it removes our ability to control our destinies, and that we have millions of potential fates- life is a series of choices and circumstances from those choices. I choose to break out of my shell and to choose adventure. I was not disappointed.

My entomologist cousin passed me the small vial which held a 3-month old avicularia poecilotheria and I named it Chavela Vargas. Chavela the tarantula is now 4 years old. If it's a female, it will may live 25-30 years. If it's a male, it may live 7-9 years. Since Chavela the tarantula is venomous, I can't handle it in order to decipher the sex. Male? Female?

And this is perfectly appropriate, given the genderqueer nature of her namesake, Chavela Vargas, the Costa Rican-turned-Mexican singer who lived to age 93. She passed away in 2012 after a life lived to all extremes and in defiance of decades of alcoholism. Chavela's voice is sandpaper, cigar smoke, spilled tequila, hard kisses, resistance and longing. I first heard her voice in college, where my queer Latin@ self was experimenting with eyeliner mustaches alone at night in my dorm room after a few drinks. Her interpretation of the song ""Macorina,"" with its innuendo and tears, wooed me with the story of a night spent with the most famous prostitute in Cuba, my mother's native country.

Chavela had many distinguished lovers: Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, and, most famously, Frida Kahlo. Two weeks ago, perusing Google Images, I found a sepia photo of them embracing and laughing heartily. Chavela is dashing in a suit; Frida has an embroidered blusa and those inimitable eyebrows. My heart leaped to see this moment of joy in the lives of two young lovers who, history has shown, experienced sorrow and heartbreak more often than most. I was moved by their courage to be in love when queerness was infinitely more taboo.

Chavela, ever the rebel, rose to fame as a singer in her beloved Mexico by singing rancheras written for men in a lamenting, low voice. Full of machismo but also ternura, she carried guns, got in bar-fights, drank herself to oblivion, and eventually bottomed-out from an internationally-lauded singing career, and because of all this, she is my MUSE. I'm a DJ, singer and electronic music producer (Soundcloud: MAMBISA) who loves throbbing basslines, layering folk songs with kicks and snares, staying up til sunrise drinking tequila, and pouring out my heart to friends and strangers. There aren't many well-known female DJ/producers, but my friends and I show our anger about that fact by killlllllin' it with audacious remixes and DJ sets, night after night, around the world.

AND ---- I'm also a yoga and meditation instructor, a social worker who works in mental health services for undocumented immigrant youth, and I'm currently dating a cis-gendered male (shout out to Fernando!) Chavela has shown me I can be both masculine and feminine, queer and seemingly heternormative, creatively-inspired and angry about injustice, partying hard and retreating into silence, in love and heartbroken, venomous and good-intentioned, happy and happily imperfect.

A couple years after I heard Chavela Vargas, I read Pema Chödrön. Pema is the most famous Western nun in Tibetan Buddhism. Before that, she was married and divorced twice. We all have demons, and I love Chavela and Pema even more for their integration of light and dark. Pema writes about the practice of being comfortable with uncertainty, an enormous challenge for humans who seek safety in the illusion of stability. One line from ""The Wisdom of No Escape"" has stuck with me for a decade: she quotes a senior teacher who told her, ""If you step on this path, you accept that you will never have It All Figured Out."" How scary. How liberating. Phew.

Thanks for reading. Thanks for being. I'd love to hear from you.

When he entered ours, he gave a cursory look at the pair passports from the guys in the top bunks, and seemed even less interested as he handed back the passports to the pair of sisters in the middle berths. But, after presenting him with our passports, he took them and quickly exited, making off towards the front of the train. My friend shot me a panicked look -- we’d already had a ‘misunderstanding’ at the Plovdiv airport that resulted in my friend’s temporary detention and the signing of a questionably legitimate affidavit about our intentions for staying in the country. So, I jumped up as quickly as possible and began chasing him down the corridor, trying, with my vast Bulgarian vocabulary of 20 words, to understand why our passports required further inspection. After giving a bored glances to the other passengers’ passports, he’d shake his head and try to shoo me back to my seat non-verbally. Finally, when we reached the cab he sighed and spat out that enduring line -- “Don’t worry, be happy.”

We got our passports back.

I’m a 21-year-old university student (though maybe 22 when this email is sent out). The past few years have been a lot and, if I’m being honest, “Don’t worry, be happy” fails to convey my actual response to most of life. Ideally, I’d regularly take a breath and recognize the futility of fretting over things but that hasn’t happened yet.

Anyway, here are some other things: My friend taught me the term “autoantonym” and I’m convinced the meaning of life is hidden in the self-awareness of that word. Is there a term for pairs of words that are usually antonyms but can be used as synonyms? Think - “I’m up for it/I’m down for it.” “This is a cool new album/This new album is hot!” Some good things to listen to: Frankie Cosmos, Cayetana, The Dodos Check out: ""High Maintenance,"" Garfield Minus Garfield, and Ticket to Ride

Can we move on from our obsession with rags-to-riches? Our fixation with individuality has blinded us to the fact it's super hard to go from a pauper to a (figurative) princess. Statistically, it just ain't gonna happen. Yet we're all enamored with it so much we refuse to admit it's a lie.

But that's not true you cry! [Insert someone you know, heard of, or saw on TV] did it!

Dammit, I just told you to stop fixating on the individual. Just because an individual achieves it doesn't mean it holds true for the population.

A level playing field means everyone has equal opportunities to achieve, and if they try hardest they should be the most successful. I hope we're all mature enough to admit we weren't all born as the exact same robot entity. We're different, and some of those differences have a big impact on our ability to achieve. But let's control for those factors by looking at the entire US population.

Let's divide the population into five sections, aka quintiles, with the poorest 20% in the bottom quintile all the way up to the richest 20% in the top quintile. If the playing field were truly level,  you would have a 20% chance of ending up in any quintile regardless of which quintile you grew up in. In other words, those born into families in the top or bottom quintile would have the same chance of winding up in the top quintile! That is to say, a 20% chance. Our sample size is large enough that statistically these values would hold true if everyone actually had the same opportunities. This concept is called economic mobility.

In the US, if you are born into the lowest quintile, you have a 1% chance to make it to the top 5%. If everything was equal you'd have a 5% chance. For perspective, you are at a 500% disadvantage. That is enormous, it's like someone just plopped Mt. Everest onto your level playing field.

But we are so obsessed with agency, the ability for an individual to control their lives, that we completely ignore structure, the system in which they live their life. Yes, it is possible to climb Mt. Everest if you weren't born on the top (ok, maybe this analogy is falling apart, but stick with me here). But it's a hell of a lot harder to climb from the bottom. Agency is making that journey up the mountain. It's hard, and you should be applauded for achieving it. But structure is pointing out that starting at the bottom is a severe disadvantage. Thus the term structural violence: the system is literally holding you down and killing you. It may sound like a bs academic term, but your life expectancy is directly correlated with your income, your race, and even your sexual orientation.

So I challenge everyone born on top of the mountain, or toward the top, to be cognizant of the fact you are most likely a white, heterosexual male living in a structure built to support white, heterosexual males. That doesn't belittle your accomplishments, it acknowledges the reality you live in. And if you did claw your way up from the bottom, do you really want to continue propagating a system that disadvantages people like you?

Sincerely,

Dirk, a white, heterosexual, male software developer tired of his coworkers looking just like him. Seattle, WA

It was mud season and on the 7th day, I broke my right leg. Crack! Right in half. The pain wasn't the first thing I noticed. It was that my foot stayed in one place while I turned my body around to sit up. I remember a constant stream of ""fuck!""’s playing in my head, because I knew the next few months I'd be sitting on my parents couch drinking cheap beer and watching HGTV instead of eating fresh mico-greens and working the first job that ever felt right. Eight months later I applied for a kitchen job in my hometown and I went to the interview on crutches. The woman who interviewed me asked if I could manage walking around on the wet floor. I said yes and got the job.

After about a year and some change, I made the decision to work in kitchen where the compost pile was just as visually appealing as the food we served. So naturally, I moved to Vermont.

What I didn’t realize at the time, was that the actual state of Vermont (specifically the NEK) can be a bit like an abusive relationship. At least from a climate-against-human (read:flatlander) standpoint. It lures you in with all its mystique, beauty, and wisdom, and entices you back at the beginning of each season - a little maple syrup never hurt anyone, right? But when the sugar high wears off and the snow starts to fall, and you have never even filled a propane tank never mind stoked a wood stove before in your life, you're tested. ""You're never gonna be as smart as that bad ass bitch Mother Nature,"" my friend said to me once. The trees stand stoic while frost covered fields silently stare you down. The yellow lines on the roads smile smugly at your tires under a light dusting of snow, waiting. Just waiting for you and that hunk of metal you’re driving to hit a patch of black ice. I lasted two winters and only had to sacrifice a taillight to the frozen pavement.

But eventually, we broke up - Vermont and I. At least decided to take some time apart. It was April 1st. ""Cheers to the lessons in solitude and building up my tolerance for whisk’,"" I said out loud to myself at a bar on my 28th birthday. Everything I owned was in the back of my truck and I was heading anywhere, as long as it was south.

I don't know what this all says about me, or the point of this narrative, but I'm moving back to Vermont and still working on farms. So there’s that. I'll save the road trip stories for another day.

P.S. I now work as a freelance graphic designer and want to specifically help promote small farmers and food-related business. Feel free to get in touch if this speaks to you!

Questions:

1. DECISIONS | Does every decision fall between 49 and 51 percent ""I’m sure about this"" ratio? Is it that 1 percent tipping point that makes you act upon a decision?

2. MUSIC | I'm driving to Georgia (again). What should I listen to? Accepting all suggestions - from Waylon to WuTang.

3. FARMING | Are you a farmer? Worked on a farm? What's one piece of advice you'd give to an aspiring farmer? (Not accepting suggestions such as, ""Don't start."")

I like penpals so if you'd like to nerd out about agriculture, herbalism, and traveling, I'd love to hear from you.

Not in that order.  I love fashion but lament the fact that all of the chicest (is that a word?) looks on runways and blogs could never be worn at a law firm.  Three law school friends and I started an Instagram account to highlight working women's fashion.  

Check us out: @attorneysonfleek  

Business casual creativity!  And funny captions, too.  (""Legalize tweed.""  Is that not genius?  Full credit to my hilarious friend on that one.)

I have a one-year-old daughter.  Every single human being on this earth grew in a woman's womb, so you'd think birth would be the most ordinary and pedestrian thing we could experience.  But it's not -- it's probably the singular most amazing and miraculous part of humanity.  That said, working moms (and non-working moms!) need the chance to honor the birth experience, and recover from it, and spend time with their newborns.  You wouldn't be here if it weren't for a mother who birthed you!  Can we give a little love to the concept of extended, paid maternity leave?  The United States is woefully behind in this regard.

I suffered a loss this month -- a miscarriage at 10 weeks' pregnant.  It made me even more grateful for my precious daughter.  Many women don't talk openly about miscarriage because early pregnancies are often kept secret.  Let's change this.  You'd understand if I said my aunt died.  I wish we could all speak freely about this type of loss, too.

I went to the OBGYN for post-miscarriage care and she asked me what I did for a living.  I told her I work in civil and criminal defense at a BigLaw firm in Manhattan.  She asked me if I represented people like OJ.  No, I said.  No murderers.  Just fraudsters.  But everyone needs a lawyer.

I had my own phone line and it had a custom ringer. But I didn't have a printer. The night before some kind of English paper was due, I pressed print, turned on my AIM away message and went to retrieve my paper from our home printer. You're probably smart enough to guess that it was located in my parents' bedroom. At approximately 10:15pm, I opened the door to their room. I'll note that it was unlocked. I then laid eyes on a situation depicted as natural, basic, even meaningful by National Geographic and ""What's Happening to my Body,"" but -- much more rightly-- as a horrifying, irrecoverable rite of passage by almost every sitcom ever: my parents doin it. Unfortunately, my gangly duck-footed stride prevented any form of stealth, so the offenders sensed an entry. My blood went cold. The imaginary camera in front of me panned the scene and queued the Jaws soundtrack. I silently closed the door and retreated to my room, sans paper, without them ever knowing the identity of the interloper. Obviously we never spoke of it.

I think my great memory is a curse. I can easily, almost involuntarily, recall not just the gruesome carnal imagery, but the choking feeling of every single one of my organs congregating in my throat, the clammy humidity that overtook my palms. Fuck fuck fuck it's happening now.

My memory also means that I think of everything as part of my ""glory days."" How could I possibly move on from senior year of high school when I can so distinctly recall the joy of ruling over our student body of 92? Will I ever feel more free than backpacking through the US National Parks with 3 near-strangers that became some of my closest friends? [See what I did there? Drew ya in with the sex and now I get to talk about this?]

People love asking me what it was like as a woman to spend a month in tents, cars, and western trails with 3 guys I had barely even met. But there's so much more that I remember perfectly! The minutia! Ask me about the never-ending conversations that spiraled away from logic and into pure conjecture without Google to aid us in the backcountry, or about the taste of uncooked noodles and powdered cheese when we were too high to remember to bring the cooking gas to the top of the mountain! Or about our total loss of social norms after our first backcountry trip, or about seeing both ends of a rainbow in the Wyoming hillsides! Ask me what it was like to spend nonstop weeks learning absolutely everything about each other and to love each other not in spite but because of it! And fine, you can ask how I managed to pee around them too.

The truth is, it's hard to know if my memory is great. I could just be another hapless, idealistic romantic who thinks sepia haze equates to glory, or who really just has an active imagination, which would explain why I remember so many things that no one else does. I guess I'm either a savant or a liar. This whole memory thing is probably also the reason why I find myself narrating experiences in real time -- it's like ""living in the moment"" for me means ""living for the memories,"" so my mind tailors my experiences to fit a narrative form for memories' sake. Anyone else out there share this wacko inclination??

PS. You know how we can't relate to our grandparents' past because the photos are in black and white? Well, I think our grandkids' equivalent will be that our histories are 2D, and their photos will be holograms.

First, a snapshot of my life: Like for many of you, the “You've won The Listserve!” email came at a difficult time for me. I’m a new physician slogging through intern year in internal medicine, which has been more draining than I could have imagined. I was never one of those people who knew that she wanted to be a doctor since age 5 (I decided to go into medicine during my last year of college) but I never had second thoughts about it until the past few months. Here’s hoping that changes. I was recently diagnosed with (a fortunately very curable type of) cancer, and having seen what goes on in operating rooms has left me very nervous about my upcoming surgery. On top of that, I just ended a significant relationship of 4 years with someone whom I love very much. Sometimes you just really really really want John Lennon to be right, but alas.

There are about 2,500 times more deaths from coal power than from nuclear power, per unit of energy produced. And before you think that solar is safer than nuclear power, there are 10 times as many deaths from solar as nuclear power. I few years ago I would have been the first to say nuclear power is dangerous. But recently, I discovered that’s not true.

Based on what I hear in the media it is tempting to believe that we are heading into an energy shortage. If we don’t find another energy source we will be screwed, right? Well, it turns out that nuclear power is cheap, clean, reliable, safe, easy to distribute and can power the world for the next 1000 years based on uranium and thorium reserves that have already been found on earth. But nuclear power scares people. Let’s talk about that.

In the history of nuclear power there have been something on the order of 1,000 deaths including research and operations. In Fukushima in 2012 there were no casualties from the partial nuclear meltdown. The radiation was largely contained by the safety mechanisms. People died because they were rushed out of ICU that day but no one died because of radiation poisoning. The three-mile Island meltdown was similar. No casualties resulted. The only nuclear meltdown to cause deaths was Chernobyl, which caused up to 125 immediate deaths and up to 4,000 others. Some reports that hundreds of thousands of people were killed or had shortened lives because of the Chernobyl meltdown are inaccurate and don’t hold up against inquiry.

Long term nuclear storage is a concern for some people. Nuclear waste from reactors running on Uranium is dangerous for about 100,000 years after that there are no major fission products that can cause harm to people. There are two main long term solutions for waste from nuclear reactors: bury in the ground or bury in the seabed. One of the solutions is already built, but facing political resistance: Yucca Mountain, Nevada. No radiation will ever come out of that. The other main long term disposal method of waste from nuclear reactors is in the mud in the sea bed. The mud of the sea bed in some areas is hundreds of feet deep. Anything in there can be geolocated but it can never come out. The mud has been there for millions of years.

A new kind of nuclear reactor is being tested that uses Thorium, rather than Uranium. Thorium produces almost no waste, the waste that is produced is safe in 100 years and thorium cannot be used to make nuclear weapons. China and India will likely have Thorium reactors operational by 2030. The United States has no plans to develop Thorium reactors.

The future of energy is already here. I thought about going into the nuclear power business this year, but I realized as an engineer I wouldn’t be able to move the needle very much: nuclear power doesn’t have an engineering problem—it has a PR problem. Somehow even though coal kills 2,500 times as many people, nuclear power is painted as the villain.

So check it out for yourself if you still think nuclear power is unsafe. I hope I made you think ;-)

Reach out to me if you have contrarian thoughts on what the world will look like in 100 years.

I came here to see a girl with whom I fell in love back in high school. We went to college and spent five years together. She then went to Paris for a masters' degree and I followed her two years later, which brings us to me moving here a year ago to work as a computer engineer. It was a pretty nice year, I made a couple of friends, mostly colleagues, but I enjoy Paris overall.A year later, today, I'm thinking of marrying that girl. But the thing is, I'm afraid. We never really lived together as we come from a pretty conservative country, and now we're seeing each other a lot more and I am not sure if I want to commit to marriage. Is it too early? I always imagined myself married at 32 or 33. But does it really matter at what age you marry? I like the lifestyle I got to develop here. Drinking with friends, going out and enjoying life. I want to still experience that a bit more, I guess. But she wants to get married and build a life together, she also doesn't want me to keep drinking alcohol as she her dad was a heavy drinker and she's always afraid I'll one day be like him. I want to bring her along this adventure but she's a bit depressed and doesn't want to make any efforts meeting new people and going out (other than once or twice a week).In another hand, I love this woman and always saw myself with her. I still do, but I'm afraid of ""missing out"" if we get married now. I am not sure what to do. I can't just ask her to wait a couple years and I go ""have fun"".Yeah anyways, I didn't know what to write about and this is all I had in mind.

Thanks for listening :)

my name is david. i'm from new haven, connecticut in the US of A. i dropped out of school and moved to germany at the beginning of september to make electronic music and sound art outside of the confines of the stifling academic-industrial complex. if you'd like to listen, i'm on soundcloud as DIN//VOID.

being in berlin has been a blast, but it comes with its own set of privileges and difficulties. so far i've had trouble finding a job with which to support artistic production, and getting settled in takes a long time. so i'm at a weird crossroads at the moment- thinking of moving to new york if i can't get a visa but also i'd really like to stay here and keep getting to know people. this is my first time ever off of north america so i'm also trying to travel around europe at the end of the month, to see what i can if i won't be living here. email me if you want to meet up in europe, or if you know anyone interested in hiring an english-speaking artist in berlin, or if you'd be interested in booking me in europe or NYC area.

i'll be unsubscribing from the listserve soon. i've been here since its first month, and it was yuppy-ish from the start, but since then the listserve seems to have degenerated into a bland self-congratulatory self-help fest. the idea of hearing from a random voice from the internet in your inbox every day is appealing, but we're a self-selecting bunch and the impassioned life advice or start-up ideas get tiresome. with that said, i want to share the ""delicious movement manifesto,"" written by one of the most influential teachers i've had, the dancer eiko otake. this is not a hard set of rules, simply a guide to movement that's really applicable anywhere - moving is all we're ever doing.

//

Move to rest, sleep, and dream.

Move to pass time, bloom, and linger.

Move to taste and share.

Move to forget and remember.

Move to experience a body as part of a landscape and landscape as a body; both breathe and move.

Look at dance as a flower that grows, blooms, wilts, to be noticed, be nurtured and be savored.

Appreciate life as movement (even in relative stillness).

Feel everyone’s life as an unrecoverable, transient, precious process within a larger sense of time and space.

Nurture kinetic imagination and kindness to oneself and others living or dead.

Be with others (present or lost), find a way to enjoy conflicts, and negotiate. Learn by experience.

Be sensual. Be beautiful and inviting in ways that are not necessarily sexual.

Dance a solo as a duet with a shadow. Dance a duet as a solo remembering a shadow.

Enjoy the flow of life but also enjoy being stuck. There is always something that can move even when one is stuck.

Move to create sustainable culture of peace.

Think about what dead people might want from us.

Move to value artistic and philosophical differences.

Honor silence

Dear friends,I have to be honest with you all, I almost didn’t write my Listserve. When I received the email roughly 45 hours ago, I was psyched. I told all my Listserve buddies and started brainstorming some ideas. Well, none of them panned out. (By the way, I write for a living, so this shouldn’t have been that difficult.)So here we are, 3 hours from deadline and not a word on the page. That’s cool, though. It’s not like I don’t know how this happened. It’s pretty obvious, after all – I’m just overthinking it.Which brings me to a very quick story I’d like to tell you all. It’s about how I learned to stop worrying and love to dance.Heading into college, I wasn’t what you’d describe as the grooviest guy around. More like the clunkiest. No moves, no swag. But I think I’m an okay dude, and I was lucky enough to make friends with a lot of great people. All sorts of people from all sorts of places, but with one thing in common – they all loved music.Now, I loved music, too – it’s not like a grew up under a rock. But I didn’t dance. (True story: I got a C in a mandatory high school dance class and at one point my teacher told me I had the flexibility of a brick.) I don’t really know why I didn’t dance, but I just didn’t. I think I was probably mixed up with what people would think and whether I’d screw up and whatnot – the usual things people think in such conversations.I’m not sure if it was the music or my friends, but something met in equilibrium that changed me forever. I became interested in new types of music and thanks to the supportive atmosphere I found myself in, I didn’t mind letting loose.The point is, this isn’t just a story about learning to dance. It’s more about being yourself. And I’m not telling this story because I think you all need a lecture. I’m just telling you because, well, how often do you get to tell 23,000 people that you really like being the person you are?I didn’t want to leave you all without sharing some music! Here are ten great songs, in no particular order.Ghost – Phish (If you’re really interested, look up the live version from 11/17/1997.)Rosalita – Bruce SpringsteenDayvan Cowboy – Boards of CanadaLet’s Go Dancing (Solomun Remix) – Tiga vs. AudionAchilles’ Last Stand – Led ZeppelinOcean (2012) – John ButlerBaby, I’m Yours – BreakbotPeaches En Regalia – Frank ZappaAcid Raindrops – People Under the StairsWilliam Tell Overture (Finale) – RossiniAnyway, thanks for reading. I want to give a shout out to my Listserve buddies, Tyler and Avery, who run a great blog called Sandwich Funk, which you can visit at Sandwich Funk dot com. They make playlists that correspond perfectly with delicious recipes. Check them out!

Take care everyone,

November 2015,14,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/11/14/it-takes-so-little/,"November 2015, 14",It Takes So Little,"I won the Listserve around midnight, riding the Yamanote line. My last night in Tokyo, after two and a half years.

What a world.

*       *       *

I moved to Japan because I was in love. I told the man I’d been dating for less than a month, “I have no desire to move to Japan,” and then instead we got married and went.

It didn’t work out. With my husband, I mean. With Japan, I fell improbably in love. Not instantly--not like a chemical reaction--but like water dripping steadily into an empty bucket, until one day you realize it’s full.

*       *       *

I became a teacher, in Tokyo, working my way up from a half-hour, kindergarten, English song-and-dance-routine to discussing and deciphering Leonard Cohen lyrics with 20-somethings at a 2-year technical college.

“There’s a crack in everything / That’s how the light gets in,” Cohen sang, and Mayuko--the class clown--cried, saying ""Meccha ii!"" over and over again (""It's so good!"")

*       *       *​

We cannot know where even our “bad” decisions will lead us. My ex-husband brought me to Japan, and he left me, but not without a gift: the radical notion of actually giving a shit about my students. You’d be amazed the way so many English language teachers talk about their pupils in Japan—that they’re stupid, infantile, incapable of intelligent thought.

I assure you, they are none of these things. A little bit of cultural understanding goes a long way: in English, we say “the squeaky wheel gets the grease,” but in Japanese, it’s, “the tallest nail gets hammered down.”

So I had to play around, to try and fail and try something else. If the whole class was lost, then I knew my fault; if one student didn't understand, it was still my responsibility. I couldn’t just stick to what had worked in the past, what was easy and familiar for me. I had to find out what was best for them.

I asked. I gave them a safe space (journals and emails) to ask questions, make suggestions, critique my teaching and connect our lessons to their lives. I took the time to get to know my kids, and I found each and every one of them to be delightfully unique and thoughtful and silly and good. They were the most amazing bunch of weirdos, and I already miss the way they made me laugh, made me cry, made me think.

I learned their names, and it meant more to them than you could ever imagine. Mariko wrote, “It is that you learned my name that I was the gladdest. When I met you in a corridor, I was very glad that you called for my name!!”

It takes so little, truly.

*       *       *

Teachers: find out who your students are. If they act out, or get bored, or something just isn’t working, find out why. It is not their job to follow your plan; it is not your place to try and be their friend; it is not for you to share your stories with them, but to help them tell their own.

Or, as Airi wrote (in response to the question, “How would you run this class if you were the teacher?”), “I think student don’t have concentration. So what is their interesting thing? I need to find it.”

*       *       *

​My interesting thing? You. Please tell me about yourselves.

People are watching me pull up from their porches and from behind their screens.

You can tell right away that it has been abandoned. There is a deep staleness to it that is apparent from afar.

I don’t know what force has pulled me to come to this house today of all days. I have had his address for ten years. My mother found it at some point and gave it to me like some sort of weird gift. I tucked it away and forgot about it, even though I moved back to my hometown a couple of years later and was living just thirty blocks away from where, according to that piece of paper, he lived.

I didn’t plan this visit. I had exactly one hour before I had to pick up my kids from school. I didn’t talk to a therapist before hand or check in with friends to see if it was a good idea. Honestly it probably isn’t—making an unannounced visit to the father figure who molested you when you were a child, the man who (because it was the 70s and things, I am told, were understood differently back then) you ended up having to live with for another ten years. And yet, having just been through an infinitely hard divorce, my mother’s attempted suicide, and a brother sent to prison—I guess I had become blind to the idea that there could possibly be something I couldn’t handle. So, instead of just driving by, I stopped. Instead of just looking from my car, I got out.

A woman comes out of her house across the street, yelling something to her twenty-something son who is halfway down the road carrying a pillowcase full of laundry.

I ask her if the man who lives at the house is still around. “Bob?” she asks. Having not heard another person say his name aside from immediate family for thirty years, this familiarity makes me pause. “Yes.” I respond, trying not to look like someone out to do harm. “He was my stepfather but I haven’t seen him for many years.”

Of course, I don't mention that the last time I saw him, he was being led out of our home in handcuffs.

She leads me to the front door of another neighbor. Tiny dogs bark and are yelled at to be silent. We are told to enter. A sickly woman sunk into a couch listens as the situation is explained. She looks at me long and hard. I can tell that she knows Bob and is desperately trying to put together him—old, hardened, mentally ill man that he probably is now—with this woman before her.

She tells me where to find him. He lives in a hotel now, the house having been condemned on account of black mold. I don’t pause. I drive to the hotel. I sit outside and look at sad, cheap hotel and think again about how much my friends would disapprove. I give my phone number in a note to the manager. Of course, I never get a call. There is relief in that.

Now I know where to find him. I know that I can confront him if I feel the pull to do so. I feel strangely satisfied with that knowledge. When I thought about writing this to the listserve, my original subject line was “How I (almost) confronted my abuser after 30 years,” but I quickly realized that wasn’t true. I confronted him and his memory that day, and that may well be enough.

I would point at the shining dots and ask him what they were. He told me about the stars and the moon and of course, none of that stuck with me because I was distracted by the pretty lights.I told him I wanted one and because my dad is a wonderful person, he humored me. He promised to go buy a ladder tall enough to reach the stars and pluck one right out of the sky for me.

When I was younger, my dad and I would drive through the city and along certain areas, I would watch oil rigs bob up and down from the car. I would point out to the giant machines, intrigued by their movement, and quickly judge that they were something you can ride.I asked my dad if I could get on them one day and because my dad is a caring person, he humored me. He promised one day we’ll get on and I could have as much fun as I wanted.

When I was younger, my dad promised me he’d live to be 300 years old. I was convinced he was untouchable.

As a college student, I’ve been away from home for a long. I usually go back home for 2-3 weeks during the winter and the summer since it is too expensive for me to fly across the country frequently. The last time I went home and saw my mom and my brother was in August. The last time I saw my dad was in January.

I feel like my dad does not get enough credit. Growing up, he was always working to support our family. My mom liked to get involve in my schools and it drove my brother and me nuts because we had that mom who got too involved. My dad was more behind the scenes; some friends knew about my dad but very few people actually got to meet him.

This past May, I got a call from my mom saying that something had happened and my dad was in a tough situation. On top of that, he got sick. I haven’t been able to talk to my dad that much in the past 5 months but the few times he’s had the opportunity to call, I give thanks because I get to hear his voice that day. I think saying that I miss my dad would be a huge understatement. I would give a lot to be able to talk to him right now or to go see him in the next few months.

After opening up the email about being chosen to share with the Listserve, I struggled to choose what to write about but my dad kept coming to mind. I decided that I just wanted to share about him because he is somebody who deserves a lot of love and appreciation right now. This one is for my dad, the man with the contagious laugh, the man with the quick temper, the man with the most selfless heart. I love you dad and I hope I get to see you soon.

I will end this with my favorite question, quote, and a joke which are completely unrelated to above:

And have no regrets,"As cliché as it may sound, when I saw the words ‘You’ve won The Listserve!’, I read and re-read them (almost thinking that it maybe someone’s subject line). But, it was Me!!! Yay :).

I’d want to keep it short! Life can be difficult, at times, so whenever it gets tough, go spend some time doing something that you love. Explore, re-discover, re-invent! I have been able to come out through the most difficult of times (read: a divorce just five months ago) by investing time in my greatest passion – travelling. It liberates you, makes you explore, and also makes you feel so humble and thank god for giving you the opportunity to experience something so beautiful. I travelled to Spiti Valley, Himachal, India, which felt like heaven on earth. So, guys, go travel. I think I am the best version of myself when I travel. And, if travelling doesn’t make you as happy…go bake, dance, read…do whatever puts that smile back on. Of course, the other thing that I really love with all my heart is my work. I am a writer and voice artist by profession, and love every, every bit of my two super-creative industries. If anyone wants to get a recording (in English, Hindi, or Gujarati), connect with me and I’d be happy to work with you! It’s my work that was my best escape, motivator, and everything in between (not to forget my amazing parents, family, friends and counselor…damn, this award speech!)

Don’t ever have any, any, any regrets in life whatsoever. If you have to bend or break to save a relationship, do it. It’s okay if it doesn’t work, but if you don’t try enough, trust me, a few years down the line, you may just regret not putting in that extra effort. If it doesn’t work out, then I am sure, it wasn’t mean to be.

Apart from travelling, I love reading. I’m currently reading ‘Still Alice,’ which has managed to choke me up quite often. I usually alternate between a happy book and a rather emotional one. Helps balance it all! And, movies! I can spend my life in an auditorium, or having movie marathons at home.

I guess, that sums it up. Here’s wishing you all a great end to the year that is, and a super beginning to the one that will be. And, keep the awesome Listserve messages rolling!!!!

Not just in the physical matter and makeup of the food. The political, social and environmental aspects are all being consumed and supported every time you take a bite.

Many people go through life with little to no thought about the food they are consuming. Who grew these things? Where did that come from? How was this grown? How did this get to me? If people asked these questions, and had genuine concern for them, we wouldn't be shipping pesticide laden spinach across the continent, when it can and is being grown organically just around the corner. To build strong local communities, we have to keep our money in them. Buy food grown locally to support local farmers.

I work as the garden manager for an organic farm which provides food year round through several means, including farmers markets and our CSA program. Community Supported Agriculture is exploding in popularity, which directly connects farmers to local consumers. Individuals or families purchase a 'share' in the farm in the spring for about $400, then they receive a box full of healthy, fresh, organic produce every week until the fall. This gives the farmer an initial income to purchase the seeds and hire labour to fulfill the demands of the growing season. And these demands are ever present. I urge all of you to volunteer at your local organic farm to get a taste for and an appreciation for how physically demanding this work is. It may be a form of heaven to be working outside all day surrounded by both wild and domestic animals and plants, but the amount of work is immense and relentless. Search for a CSA farm near you and buy a share, or go help out. You will learn lots, eat healthy food and your farmer will greatly appreciate it.

I've started a flock of Indian Runner Ducks. They are hilarious and beautiful ducks who stand vertical like a penguin. They are the best foragers of any duck or chicken, and can lay up to 300 eggs a year. They have the most colour variation of all ducks including; chocolate, white, silver, mallard, blue, black, apricot trout, fawn and others. I recommend them to anyone living in a rural area. An interesting fact is that all domestic ducks (aside from muscovy's) are descendants of the common mallard. This includes runners, pekin, cayuga, khaki campbell, welsh harlequin, rouen etc. I've got five runners so far, named Ayples and Banaynay, Cool Runnings, Robert Larmer, Pickled Pumpernickle, and Pamplemousse Chartreuse. I love them.

So please, think about the food you are eating. For our canadian thanksgiving, everything we ate came from the farm. Carrot, rutabaga, brussels sprouts, sweet potato, turkey and even pie pumpkins for the pie. Where did or will your food for thanksgiving come from? Who grew it? How was it grown? How did it get to me? We need to start asking and addressing these questions.

Email me if you can relate to any of the preceding, please!

November 2015,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/11/09/grandpa-music-and-elevators/,"November 2015, 09",Grandpa Music and Elevators,"Hello Listserve,

I’m a 25-ish year old Mechanical Engineer in Atlanta.  I’m passionate about my job, but I don’t like to let that define who I am - though I conform to a few engineer stereotypes (I have a 3D printer at home, I love math, I’m a bad dresser, and I’m a bit of an introvert). I’ll admit I’m no “special snowflake” in that regard, but my main passion is music.

I play with a few bands around town on weekends (guitar, fiddle, and stand-up bass).  I’m crazy about pre-WWII blues (especially piedmont-style guitar), old-time fiddle tunes, ragtime, and early jazz/swing. If I could, I’d love to go hang out in the 1920’s for a week or so. Lately I’ve been listening to Lowe Stokes, Boswell Sisters, Stuff Smith, Clarence Williams, Bull City Red, Rev. Gary Davis, Blind Blake, Charlie Poole, and Mississippi Sheiks (to name a few).  I love finding new people to play with and being introduced to old songs and styles I’ve never played.  If you’re in the Atlanta area, let’s meet up and play some tunes!  Regardless of where you are, I’d love to hear what you’re listening to.

Let’s talk about Elevators.

Are you afraid or cautious of elevators? Are you an elevator mechanic?

Regardless of the order, if you answered ""yes"" to one question and ""no"" to the other question, you should change your mind. If you only ride them, you should have no fears unless someone is trying to assassinate you. If you work on them every day, for the love of god please be careful!

For passengers, elevators are approximately 10-bajillion times safer than any other mode of transportation if you look at it by miles traveled. I would love to cite this statistic, but I can’t paste URL's (sorry). There are multiple redundant safety mechanisms in place to protect passengers, and they are waaaaay over-engineered.  For example, the MINIMUM number of suspension cables allowed by law in the USA is 3, and each cable is required to support 6 to 12 times the weight of whole system by itself.  You can throw away any fears you have about those cables snapping and falling to your death.  Even if they magically disappeared, there are emergency brakes in place to stop you before you get moving too fast.  Search “how elevator safety gears work” if you’re mechanically inclined and interested.

Having said this, elevator technicians have one of the most dangerous jobs out there.  If you do a search for “elevator fatalities,” you will find that an overwhelming majority of elevator-related accidents involve technicians and installers rather than passengers. They’re working with hunks of steel moving at high speeds and operating on high voltages suspended high above the ground.  It’s a recipe for disaster if one isn’t careful.

Random factoids:

For especially tall buildings, the hoist-cables weigh more than all of the moving components combined!

The “door close” button actually does work.  It’s just slower in some buildings because code requires the doors to stay open for a minimum number of seconds.  If the equipment is old, technicians will sometimes set them to be slower to prevent rattles.

That “fireman trick” where you hold the door close button to skip every floor doesn’t work unless you have special access to the controller.  Even then, I’m not entirely sure if it’s a real thing.

If you haven’t guessed by now, I work for an elevator company.

I’m out of space, but if you have any elevator questions, drop me a line and I’ll do my best to answer them!

November 2015,07,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/11/07/are-you-a-good-person/,"November 2015, 07",Are you a good person?,"Are you a good person? By what definition? Why does it matter?

When was the last time you've questioned the quality of your own character? I could be wrong, but I think a majority of people in the world would like to think of themselves as good people, and I am almost certain that 100% of parents feel it is important that the children they raise grow up to be good people. So why are there so many rotten things happening in the world?

I've always thought of myself as a good person, but increasingly, especially at work, I find myself dealing with irate, rude people with a sense of entitlement and an air of disconnect with the real world. (For reference, I work at a dental practice in the Financial District of NYC) Also, people who value designer bags over having a full set of teeth in their heads. That aside, I bet these people would think of themselves as good people too.

Are you good, even if it's selectively? Do you only remember the times you harbored honorable feelings in your heart for everyone? Have you omitted from your memory, for convenience, for moral survival, the times you pretended to be asleep when you spotted the 10 months pregnant woman on the crowded train so you wouldn't have to offer your seat? So that you could keep sleeping until your stop? Did you decide that that doesn't make you a bad person because of all the times you told the cashiers they gave you too much change? And gave them back the extra $10 they accidentally gave you, despite being broke as hell? Are you not good because the thought of just shutting up and keeping it played in your head for a full five seconds? Do you find yourself rationalizing and justifying your behavior for a better night's sleep?

If the percentage of times you do the right thing is higher than the times you don't, does THAT make you a good person? Maybe the ability to feel guilt and remorse makes you good. Maybe we are conditioned to feel empathy only for those who are most like us, which is why the outrageous, increasingly common (and in many cases legal, by way of the justice system) brutalizing and killing of Blacks in America persists and most of those who are not Black in America are seemingly unfazed.

And maybe that's why so many rotten things are happening. We don't stop enough to think about our actions, words and thoughts, and we especially don't consider our inactions.

While I don't have any profound answers about the importance of goodness, I hope you find value in the question.  Being good doesn't mean you need to be mindlessly nice or be someone who doesn't ""rock the boat"". In fact, you'll find that in being good, you may have to stand up for a cause and to speak up against tyranny sometimes. Being good matters. Not because you love God or fear hell. Not because you're afraid of disappointing your parents. It matters because it is the most peaceful way to live.

I want to use the opportunity of the Listserve to make a plea on behalf of my favourite subject. 

We often hear the word used to mean something negative: politicians are attacked for using ""empty rhetoric"", and a ""rhetorical question"" is a question that doesn't want an answer -- not a real question, in other words. People with a sense of ""classical rhetoric"" might think of something boring involving togas and long Latin and Greek words.

But rhetoric, simply put, is persuasive language: which, one way and another, means almost every bit of language you come across. Every advert you see is rhetoric. Every compliment to a lover. Every memo to a colleague. We all spend our lives constantly wanting things -- money, a kiss, that overdue report on our desk now -- and the way in which we get those things, through language, is rhetoric. 

So understanding how it works is a way of understanding human nature. And it is, for those so inclined, a way of getting a closer look at the glories of language: the way a sentence can be given a memorable cadence, the way it can be linked to other sentences with sound-effects and repetition, and the foxy ways in which arguments can be finessed.

Rhetoric goes back further than the birth of Christ -- Aristotle, in the 4th century BC, laid down the ground-rules -- and reaches right into the age of Twitter. 

Aristotle said that someone convinces you in three ways: ethos, pathos and logos. Ethos is the speaker's (or writer's) appeal to the audience: are they honest, impressive, authoritative, sympathetic? Pathos is the way the speaker sways his audience's emotions: rousing anger, or pity, or laughter. Logos covers the actual arguments that are used. 

But at the smaller level, rhetoric furnishes us with ways of thinking about almost anything language can do. Listen to any political speech, and you'll hear things bunched in groups of three (tricolon), phrases repeated at the beginnings of successive sentences (anaphora), ideas placed in the balance against each-other (antithesis) and, of course, our old friend the rhetorical question (erotema).

If you start to notice it, you start to see the world in a different way: you'll take pleasure in good argument and skilful use of language, you'll get better at telling when someone's trying to put one over on you, and you'll be better at mounting arguments and persuasive appeals of your own. 

I love the subject so much I even wrote a simple introduction to it, which is (I hope) an easy read and full of jokes -- though in the spirit of the Listserve I won't link to it here. (If you're interested, my Twitter profile @questingvole has details.)

Anyway, that's the pitch: if studying rhetoric was interesting to Cicero, Shakespeare and Abe Lincoln... isn't it worth your while dipping in? That's a rhetorical question too.

I was minding my own business looking for excedrine when this interaction took place:

W: Honey, I want you to know that Jesus loves you very much.Me: Oh…well, thank you.W: No, I mean it…it’s something that you really need to know.Me: Well, I do…so, thanks.W: it’s just that…Jesus really loves the harlots of this world.Me: Ummmm…did you just call me a harlot?W: Sweetie, you have that harlot look to you.Me: I’m not sure what a harlot look is, but…thank God Jesus loves all of us.W: Amen! Have a good day!

Here's what my thoughts on the event known as ""harlotgate"" are… (It might be important for me to say at this moment that I’m a pastor… Yes, I am an ordained United Methodist Pastor.)

This woman was doing what she was doing out of love. Yes, her method might be a little questionable...but she was telling me about a Jesus she has found to love her. I didn't ask her what her story was...I didn't ask how she came to love Jesus & want to tell others about him. My guess is that if I would have, I might understand this conversation a whole lot better.

People like this make my job a lot harder. If she had said this to someone else, the outcome might have been very different. (and let's be honest...she probably has...).  To be labeled as something you're not can be detrimental & damaging to someone's faith journey. Personally, I come from an understanding that everyone reflects the image of God & that nothing can separate us from the love of God. Grounding my conversation (hopefully) in this help me to enter into a conversation very differently. I also understand that everyone has a story of how they are who they are. You didn't just wake up one morning the person that you are...understanding people's stories helps to know who they are without applying your label to them.

I didn't always believe that nothing can separate us from God's love...I didn't always believe that people are created in the image of God...I didn't always believe it was important to know people's' stories...I might have had some of the same conversations that woman had with me... In my journey, God did not change... But I did. And my understanding of who God is & how to share that message has changed dramatically over the years. It doesn't mean that I expect everyone to have the same experience that I do or even believe in God the same way I do...

What I will keep doing is this-- share the love of God with anyone I meet. In words or in actions...help to teach others to be mindful of what they say & do...keep encouraging others to share their stories which may or may not include a belief in God... I will also keep exploring to try & understand more & more why God loves a harlot like me.

I would also love to hear your stories… Feel free to share them with me at  and thanks for letting me share mine!

Any input is welcome!My name is Juan, I'm a 29yo programmer currently residing in Buenos Aires, Argentina.I would describe my self as a self learner, left school when I was 13 years old and started working right away to help support my family.I do not regret my decision to quit school, I've learned many things along the way, had many jobs and traveled to different countries.However, if I could start over, I would do many things differently.

I have done many things during my life so far, and many things branded me for the rest of my life.I've been a boy scout, a telemarketer, a clerk and even a barman in the UK. Worked freelance, had my own software company and worked for an international IT and management consulting firm based in the United States.Lost my dad to cancer 16 years ago and the same disease took my mom a year ago.Took a couple of first aid and CPR courses and had to use them once.Had a couple of “serious” relationships. Flown a plane, done competitive shooting and archery.Learned English and been teaching myself Portuguese the last few months. Taught my self how to repair computers, how to write programs and make websites.I lived abroad, and plan to move to a different country sometime in the near future.

My guess is I am built to learn stuff at my own pace, never could follow the program at school.I find languages easy, specially programming ones (20 so far).

If you are still reading this, you know the basis of my life story. I invite you to write to me, maybe you want to know something about computers or what is like to live in Argentina, maybe just need to talk to someone. Or even better, you might want to teach me something.

Something about Pattammal:Pattammal is now old. Some in family call her ""Appayi"". She has the best smile. One can only imagine how she would have been when she was young and swell and shy.It seems she was like a rose bud when she was born. So they named her Bud Rose. You know, she was born in a village famous for rose buds. Colloquially, in local slang, folks called her Buttu Rose.....which eventually became pattu rose. Pattu means silk.When she was ready for her wedding, she was given a new name - Pattammal - as a title in her wedding card. Pattammal means Silk Lady (Pattu+Ammal). And that is how Rose Bud became Pattammal.

She has no material possessions - A trunk box, a diary, a mirror, a comb, a towel and her attire. May be some hidden treasure in that rusted trunk Box. Pattammal now often gives a lost look at the distant sun through the open windows; touching and feeling gently her wrinkles and folds; she gives a heavy sigh and wonders what her almighty beholds;

Something about the ant:It just surfaced from “Ctrl” button. Hope it finds its way out of the Window.

(I wrote the above during the Baltimore Uprising.)

Yesterday, I was with Hands Up United organizers in St. Louis. Suddenly, they got a message on their phones and pain overtook their faces. Another young black male was killed by police near Ferguson. (Witnesses say police shot him from 6 feet away in the mouth. The police report says he shot himself. If you want more info or to see the heartbreaking video of his mother screaming, “Don’t shoot my baby!” look up #AmonderezGreen. Yes, another young black male has become a hashtag.)

If we don’t see Jesus as a marginalized brown-skinned Jew living on the underside of the oppressive system of the Roman Empire, then we don’t really see Jesus. If we don’t know that the Gospel speaks directly to the foreigner, the poor, and the minority, then we don’t really know the Gospel. And if we don’t hear the narrative of those most oppressed in the streets of Baltimore, in the streets of St. Louis, then we don’t really hear the voice of Jesus.

The Church has been absent from this conversation and complicit in oppression. I’m sorry. We can do better because Jesus calls us to be better.

November 2015,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/11/01/i-thought-the-plane-was-going-down/,"November 2015, 01",I thought the plane was going down.,"I used to travel a lot for work, but of all those trips, mindlessly staring at the stretched fabric of the headrest in front of me, only one flight truly stands out. I’ve experienced plenty of turbulence before, but this was a whole different level.  The jostling started with random rumbling, and a subdued volume of voices from the seats.  Then the drops began, sudden and gravity-filled drops that were felt by my spinal cord before my brain. Some ancient human ancestor evolved this bundle of spinal nerves that knew emergency situations required reflexes, not logical consideration, and now my reflexes were taking over my world.  When the pilot began to make purposeful maneuvers, we all knew he was attempting to avoid something, be it air pressure, storm clouds or whatever they see from those little trapezoid windows up front.  The cabin had become really quiet now.  The occasional high-pitched yelp that escaped a few passengers lips with each drop had made way to silence. It was the silence of focus on the sound of the plane and the feel of the armrests being squeezed like dumbbells in a curl. We were waiting for the next jolt to be our last.	But all this is not what made the flight memorable.  Over the strained silence, several rows back, the sound of a young child, probably about 2 or so came drifting up the cabin.  She was laughing, giggling actually.  It was such a startling response to our fate, that I had to turn and look to see the child.  I turned and peeked between the rows of upright seatbacks to see her mother holding her aloft and making faces as she raised and lowered the child with each bump and drop of our flying capsule. The mom had turned what was a sufficiently frightening experience for adults into a joyride of roller coaster fun for the toddler.  While we were contemplating the rest of our life, she was having the time of hers.  The contrast was stark.	Our human perspective is malleable.  Our world is literally what we make it. Like that mother creating a whole new reality for her child, we can (and should) make a reality for ourselves.  So my question to you is “What is your Preferred Reality?”  How would you imagine or create your own relationships, community, society?  If you were to metaphorically hold up a toddler and create a new perspective, what would it be?	Answer however you will.  Everyone’s answers will be unique to their experience. Personally, I am concerned that our rapid pace of technological development is far outstripping our human and social development. We can instantly communicate with nearly anyone on the globe, but for fear of conflict or embarrassment, I’m reluctant to ask my neighbor to quiet his always barking dog.  The social challenges seem much more difficult than any technological ones. We’re on the cusp of self-driving vehicles and 3-D printers that will be our Star Trek replicators, but we still have no solution to all of the ills of hunger, homelessness, poverty, and a myriad of societal problems.  My Preferred Reality is one in which we value the community and our social interactions, maybe even to a greater degree than our jobs and our stuff.  Maybe our tech can lead to incredibly rich experiences and intertwined relationships, instead of a more sheltered or narrow circle of existence.  Then again, maybe I’m just a dreamer who needs to get out more. Maybe I should get on a plane.

I always imagined I would have something really clever to tell when I won the Listserve, but to be honest.. I feel more confused than ever. So if you feel like it - this is your opportunity to share some of your wisdom with me :)

Ever since my childhood years I have felt 'out of place' and I just assumed that ""that's life"". Today I feel more 'in place', and understand that I have the power to create the life I live :)

This spring my doctor put me on sick leave. I was burned out from a stressful job. In being a 'good girl' I had totally exhausted myself trying to be more. And six months later I find myself questioning everything.. Why am I here? What is my purpose in life? What career would I love? And would it bring in the cash? Do I need the cash?

I have listed some topics I find incredibly interesting, and I would love to hear your take on it. 

- Awareness / consciousness- Living off-grid (and self sustained)- Ayahuasca - vine of the soul journey- Horses- Healing- Travel- Nature as medicine: herb, flower, plant- Speaking with animals- Tantra- Wicca- Diving- Free energy

And here's a shout out to Christian, my friend and ex-co-worker, who introduced me to so many interesting things in life - also the Listserve!

And a big thank you to all of you for your insightful/funny/serious/sad/enlightening words - more than once you have changed the way I see things <3

October 2015,30,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/10/30/preparing-for-the-inevitable/,"October 2015, 30",Preparing for the inevitable,"Many people express surprise when they are invited to write for the Listserve. Not me. I saw this coming. That’s why I added an entry to my to-do list long ago: “prepare an entry for the Listserve”. Of course, I never actually got around to doing it. My to-do list is mostly added to; it’s a list of things I want to have done, but don’t want to do right now. Arguably it’s a procrastination tool, and I might be better off without it.

So suffice it to say, I am unprepared. After all, what are the odds of winning the Listserve? That’s an interesting question, actually, and the answer is not what you think. The Listserve’s website claims over 23,200 subscribers. A daily chance of 1 in 23,000 amounts to winning about once every 63 years. I’ve only subscribed to this list for 306 days. The fact that I’m writing this message at all is a little suspicious.

Going by the creation date of the Twitter account, the Listserve was created 1284 days ago. Even taking into account the 978 winners before I joined the list, I am still quite lucky to win. In fact, the probability of that happening is about 1,39%. That’s nearly the top 1%! Am I really that lucky, or is there another explanation?

Estimating the chance to win the Listserve based on observed time between joining and winning is like trying to solve the German tank problem using a single data point. It’s hard (though using the official subscriber count as an upper bound may help), but let’s speculate anyway. What if the majority of subscribers never capitalize on the chance to send a message? Perhaps these people are too lazy to write, too busy, too boring, on vacation, or unable to access their mailbox. Perhaps they suffered an untimely death.

Whatever the reason, if only 1 in 3 winners do write, that means almost 3,000 people were eliminated when I joined the list, and my invitation was one of the next 900 or so. In that case, I’m lucky enough to be in the top 5%. Before I head off to the casino, let’s take this idea a little further.

What if only 1 in 10 winners actually write back, and the other 90% might as well not exist? In that case, I’m only among the first 23% active participants to receive my golden ticket. That’s still better than average, but sufficiently mundane to put my doubts to rest. I suspect that’s the untold secret of The Listserve: 9 out of 10 subscribers are ghosts.

There are two things to take away from this:

Most people who win the Listserve don’t write back (perhaps as many as 9 out of 10).Consequently, your turn to write will come much sooner than you think (probably within the next year).

If you don’t want to be part of the silent majority, be prepared. After all, half the fun is in the writing. If you plan to write at all, why not start tonight?

If my wife wakes up right now I'm sure she'll think of the Blair Witch Project when she sees my face glowing with cell phone light coming from within my sleeping bag. 

I hadn't plan to write this at this hour of the night but I'm a terrible sleeper so it is as good a time as any. Is my mind keeping me up or, like tonight, something physically wrong like hiccups? 

BTW, this is modern-day family camping. Not roughing it, as we have most life amenities like single-serving coffee brewers.

Having recently read 'Into the Wild' you'd think I would be looking for something similar in my trip, but no. At this stage what really pleases me is to see us unplug and enjoy some moments out in Nature.

At home I sleep -or try to sleep- with a CPAP. No hiccups with that thing on, but many 3am awake nights nevertheless. 

Why do we hiccup? It seems like one the weirdest body symptom that is generally experienced. 

It feels hot in here. I didn't bring long-johns so my jeans are still on. We have a burn ban in Arkansas so at least my jeans don't smell like smoke.  The hiccups woke me. Each one of only 5 experienced would make the inflatable mattress shake and sway. Crazy, right? The thought that came into my head at hiccup #3 or 4 was ""change your condition"" so I sat up, swallowed hard, and held my breath after #5. It's been about 30mins hiccup-less... I'm still expecting them to return. 

This story has no life skill -unless you can learn to stop hiccups like this. Nor does it have a philosophical message. So i'll just tell my fellow listservians that I wish you many good restful nights, peace, love, happiness, and that you enjoy some beautiful nature wherever you may be.

A note on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA): Technology is so advanced in some areas while they severely lack in others. We can put a stent in and around the heart but we can't stop our throats from closing up? How about designing a stent-like *one-time* solution for the millions of us suffering from OSA? I hope one of you will make it happen!

I felt the dull prod of a guitar capo and a string of Buddhist prayer beads. I cast my mind about and hatched a plan. And of course, the rest is history.

Ok, so the above paragraph may or may not be fiction. This however, is completely true:

I graduated high school at 17. After 12 years of study I could draw for you the complex atomic structure of various carbon molecules. But when my first boss told me I had to file a tax return, I told him I hadn’t returned any taxes this year, so it probably wasn’t a problem.I had no idea what a tax return was.I was embarrassed.I was supposed to be ‘ready’.

So, I’m now 25. After four years of development, I’ve created Mind the Gap Tax for Teens. Any classroom in Australia (and hopefully one day the Western World) can learn about what it means to be a real adult in the real world.

The program is just beginning, and right now it’s just me. I launched earlier this year. It’s been hard. I’ve launched a GoFundMe campaign, a social media campaign, and the site is now live for the whole world to see. Any help, suggestions, and support are greatly appreciated.

Not any sort of duvet either. He was very specific. Soft and snuggly tog 13.5, the warmest kind available.

I drove back and forth, buying the department’s store entire supply, while my father coordinated with me on the phone, as he lay dying at the King Hussein Cancer Center.

“Get five king-sized duvets for my nephews, the sons of my sister Em El-Abed,” he would say. “The winter is long and cold, and it will keep them and their wives warm. Get one for my sister Salwa, and one for my sister Hanan. Drop off a couple at my friend Nidal's house, and three at your cousin’s place.”

It went on and on. And I would go, get the duvets, and drop them off to the homes of my father’s loved ones. I’d go back home, get more money, buy more duvets, and drop them off too.

Then my father died on the 10th of January, 2009. It was a cold, rainy winter, but all his loved ones slept warm, protected by blankets of my father's love.

Warmth is a gift that most people in developed economies take for granted. In Jordan, a small and poor country stuck between a rock and three awful places, we have hundreds of thousands of refugees in makeshift housing, all about to brave the cold, wet, and sometimes-snowy Jordanian winters. There are many ways you can help buy blankets to keep these refugees warm, like donating through UNHCR.

Give the gift of warmth this winter.

Also, come visit Jordan. It's a beautiful and safe country, and our tourism industry (a huge contributor to our already-crappy GDP) has been strongly affected by the events in the region. Google Wadi Rum, Wadi Mujib, Petra, Jerash, Um Qays, and Hamamat Maen. If you have any questions or would like suggestions about visiting, feel free to email me at

I haven’t experienced enough supernatural phenomena to firmly believe in them, but I like to think that spirits or ghosts can hang around and interact with us in some way. A friend and I were in a coffee shop once and this question came up, which was followed by a solid hour and a half of intense conversation about spirituality, religion, politics, the state of the world, the future of the world, our future, what we were afraid of, what we hoped to achieve. I love these kinds of conversations, where one topic leads to another and you end up with an interesting exchange of thoughts and ideas. Being vulnerable or opening up to others can be intimidating, but it's great when you can share personal things and connect on a deeper level. We get so caught up in our busy lives that I wish these conversations happened more often (not necessarily a long one, but you know, something beyond small talk). How often do you connect with people like this? Do you find it easy or difficult to do? If you ever need a topic, maybe ask them if they believe in ghosts and see where it goes.

On a lighter note, a little bit about me:I’m 22, a recent marketing graduate and current graphic design student. I like movies, musicals, and more recently started getting into board games (a few that I’ve tried and liked: Saboteur, Bang, King of Tokyo, Coup, Love Letter: Batman edition, Sheriff of Nottingham, and Settlers of Catan). One of my favourite memories is stargazing with my family at Lake Okanagan last summer; it was a beautiful night.

I always longed for the day when I would finally win the Listserve, but now I have to admit that I almost considered not writing anything at all. I've spent the last day agonizing over what to write, finding the perfect topic, starting and stopping this email a thousand times.

And then I realized that the one thing that was stopping me was the one thing that I really did need to talk about: self doubt. This is a concept that has followed me throughout my entire life, governed so many of my decisions, caused me to miss so many opportunities. I think this is something that most of us can agree we share, the overwhelming fear of not being ""good enough."" It's a bit ridiculous, don't you think? Based on what scale are we all so painfully ridiculing ourselves? I'm currently in the midst of what has thus far been the strangest period of my life, the transition from college to the ""real world."" Let me tell you, it's terrifying. Leaving your comfort zone, your best friends, your home that has held your hand through the most self-defining years you've ever lived through - it doesn't feel good. Still, as many changes as I might be facing, the hardest of them all is believing that I have the right to be confident, the right to believe that I am, indeed, enough.

I think we're all looking for some sort of reassurance, a pat on the back and just being told that we are doing ok. Why do we find it so difficult to do this from within? I know that sounds cheesy as can be, but if I've learned anything in my mere 22 years of life, it's that we all need to stop being SO insanely hard on ourselves! The only one who holds an opinion of you that matters, is you. I know better than anyone that this can be the hardest realization to come to, but I can promise that you are worth more than you believe.

Some final notes:

Find something that you are passionate about. Do yourself this favor, and don't go through life as only a series of motions.

If you've never been to NYC, get yourself there immediately.

Binge watch Friends as often as you get the chance to.

Smile at everyone you pass.

Stop body shaming. Especially if it's to yourself. I can rant and rave about this one forever, but I'll spare you.

Whether you believe you can or you can't, you're right.

This is already far longer than I was planning, so I'll leave you at that. I'd love to hear your thoughts!

Have a happy day :)

The burden lies not in the volunteerism; I love communicating in various ways with Olena and Dawud and Xóchi and Hanh (who never stops smiling). At the Adult Literacy Center in my hometown, we focus on ESL training on Tuesdays and Thursdays, assigning English workbooks and diagramming Elvis lyrics to pillage the students' cultures and decimate their beings.

These disparate souls convene semi-weekly, a lá Breakfast Club, to assimilate. They are told to practice English at home; to turn off their telenovelas and their Ekvator FM (transmitted Ukrainian radio) and listen to American programming.

I fear that this English is not good enough. It is not their culture. It is not my culture (my own Ghanaian name stumbling over the tongues of substitute teachers and job markets alike). It is loss, societal thievery in the slyest manner. It is hard to tell them that this America, this marvelous nation, isn’t faultless. It is like unveiling Oz, exposing the shames of reality to the innocent.

For they are beautiful as they whisper sounds of their homelands, mellifluous melodies that are sometimes brash, sometimes sweet. With no reservation, they paint their childhoods filled with fears of the legendary Chupacabra and the Nachtkrapp; with tales of ruthless endeavors in getting sugarcane candies like Los Tubos and Moreliano; with belly-filled laughter and animated cries and lively, no, vivacious shouts! They speak their heritage through short stories of the nippy sea (too fría to enjoy), and of the people back home (too many to remember). They uplift their beings with every blessing that they gift this world, with every life that they captivate.

I sit them down over English crossword puzzles.

“No!” they cry. They have a duty to this nation, a fierce love for this America, even when this America doesn’t (always) love back.

I don’t like this “need” to teach “literacy” to the already literate souls. Their literacy is empyrean, transcendent above all notions that this Standard American English is the benchmark for culture. I know that they are self-literate, human-learned.

But I cannot volunteer for myself; I volunteer for Olena, Dawud, Xóchi, and Hanh (who never stops smiling).

I volunteer for their formidable duty.-----------------I prayed over this Listserve, you know. I prayed that if I were ever given the opportunity to raise a platform for any issue or any cause near to me, my God would give me the words to speak.

These are my words.

Please feel free to reach out to me at any time concerning the ugly necessity of English literacy (above all other forms and mechanisms of language) in this world. Please feel free to reach out to me at any time concerning any aspect of faith or religion or theology. I think that you’re never supposed to indulge in religion and/or politics in public forums, but when I’ve been given the chance to experience life fully convinced that someone hangs the sun in the sky every new day and draws breath into my lungs with every passing moment, I like to do life on the wild side and live like I'm saved.

Take care.

October 2015,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/10/22/infertility-etiquette-and-other-suggestions/,"October 2015, 22",Infertility Etiquette and Other Suggestions,"Infertility sucks. We struggled some with infertility before conceiving our son. At the time, it felt like a major battle, but as I reflect, a few doses of medication and some shots were really a drop in the bucket.

Then, for nearly two years we went through an even tougher journey as we tried to conceive #2. As an educator, I was reminded of children constantly. I saw parents that frankly never appreciated the blessings they were given, and I felt fury. Friends and acquaintances would ask innocent questions that cut me to. the. core. Yes, we wanted our son to have a sibling. Yes, I was aware we should “probably get on that.”

Ouch.  Secondary infertility was awful. When I finally broke and started saying, “We’ve been struggling with infertility” one of two things usually happened. 1) The inquirer felt immediate remorse and slinked away 2) I heard the cringe-worthy words “well, at least you have your son.” Yep, I certainly did. I love him to pieces. But those words made me feel guilty for wanting more. Since it wasn’t happening naturally, I felt like I was ungrateful for wanting more.

The biggest thing I learned from our battle with infertility is that we were NOT unique. Our story is mild in comparison to many couples I know. There is so much heartbreak out there for the couples struggling daily with infertility. I am now pregnant with the help of modern medicine and God, but I still have a mindset of an infertile woman. I do not forget where I have come from.

I really wasn’t sure what to write when I found out I won, but today one of my dearest friends found out that her best hope for conception was IVF or adoption. Infertility is always on my mind.

I leave you with a few suggestions. The first is to stop and think before you speak-particularly in the case of infertility.

Avoid saying:

1)   You can adopt/do IVF. --- Did you know this is outrageously expensive and not always successful? Yes, adoption too.

2)   Relax and it’ll happen when you least expect it. --- Trust me, my thickened uterine lining and reproductive system failing to ovulate were not remedied by a good massage.

3)   If it’s meant to be, God will make it happen. --- I fully believe God is the reason we did conceive, but when you say this it makes us feel like God doesn’t find us worthy to conceive. Then we start thinking about all the negligent parents out there who did…

Try this instead:1)   Lend an ear. Listen to your friend and let them know that you are always there for them. Give them a hug.

2)   Remember them on Mother’s Day or Father’s Day. Those holidays hurt the aching, longing hearts. A simple text is sufficient.

3)   Show that you are interested. Do some research on infertility. Offer to attend a difficult appointment or watch their other child/children.

The last thing I will say is to “always be a little kinder than necessary” (J.M. Barrie). It doesn’t have to be infertility, guys. People are struggling every single day. Each person is fighting a battle that you may know nothing about. What I do know is that if you were to hear each person’s struggle, your response to their actions might be different. Take a moment to inquire about someone’s day and offer a smile. We can all use a bit more of that in our lives.

I joined the Listserve community few years ago and I thought that when it would be my turn to win the lottery I would be in my home town with internet and inspiration. Well, I am currently in the middle of the SAHARA desert on a mission for work. I have 48 hours to send the email and internet is like an oasis here… Very rare.

This is my chance to give you 600 words so here I am:

CREATING A SPECIAL CONNECTION?

I value human interactions; I love to hear someone’s story. I sincerely think that each life, each story is special even if you’re not a world traveler, a NOBEL laureates winner or a KARDASHIAN. So, I thought I would ask if some of you would want to start a sharing group. Whether you are a doctor in INDIA, a fisher in SWEDEN, a student in IRAN or an engineer in FRANCE (that would be me) the only condition is your willingness to share, to get to know each other without judging lifestyles or choices and just to be part of something special.  We could share thoughts, pictures, ideas, videos of our everyday lives and using all kind of means (whatsapp, letters or carrier pigeon). I love the idea that somewhere in our ordinary life, we would build a relationship with complete strangers and learn from each other.

WHO I AM

My name is Mehdi it means “the person who guide” (very interesting knowing the fact that I never remember where I park my car when I go to the supermarket).I have Algerian roots but I was born and raised in France, I love being a mix of culture but I feel like an outcast in both countries, so basically I feel home when I travel because all I am then is a traveler.

I am a 27 guy who wanted to create robots then I was hired in a company and realize that capitalism is making me become a robot.

When I was young, I've asked my mum why the people are black and white in old movies, she said because there was no color back in the day (I realize now that she meant movies in colors) but for years, I thought that the world was black and white until someone invented colors (F.Y.I. I was 6 or 7) (And F.Y.I I graduated from university).

My favorite color is blue and my best friend is a guy, soon to be surgeon, named Zarak and we understand each other in a way I’ve never thought possible. One of the most precious thing in my life is the smile on my nephew’s face when he sees me walking through the door.

LISTSERVE 2.0 EVOLUTION

What would you say if you could talk to the world? Well, everytime I watch the news I think that if I could speak louder than all of them, I would beg them to stop fighting. I would tell them that we are ALL human, in ONE planet for such a FEW amount of time. Life is a gift and peace not a goal it’s a choice. Power, money, lands, those stuff won’t follow you when you’ll passed away. Learn to share, open your eyes and think. We don’t need to love each other; we just need to live with each other.

My ideas to evolve the Listserve experience-         Creating an e-book of all the past e-mail-         Put a map on the website and every member could pin their location.

I have 3 orders of business that I have been waiting forever to send out to the listserve.

1) Help me find my sister: In 2004, my dad passed away suddenly and while sorting through old copies of his will, we found out that we have a sister named Sarah (or Sara, I cannot remember the spelling). My mom knows very little as this happened before they met. I realize this is a long shot, but I'm going to take it! Here's what I know:

---- Her name is Sara(h), her mother was from either Finland, Sweden, or Norway and returned there when she was pregnant. Norway seems to stick out in my mom's mind. My dad was Filipino so she would be a beautiful mix of those 2. She's born anywhere from 1977-1980. They either met in Hawaii, Minnesota, or Chicago.

Any leads? Please send info to (Dionisio is my last name if that helps)

2) For about 5-6 years, I have traveled the world and asked people one question: What is love to you? I have not decided what to do so far with the responses I have received thus far, but am hoping to get a big enough database to either start some sort of website (like PostSecret which is fabulous) or a listserv of sorts. So, I ask you listserve, what is love to you? 

3) PSA: Please never ever, ever, ever, EVER shake a baby! It seems common sense, but happens more often than you think. When frustrated, put the baby down in a safe place and walk away.

Hug more, love more, everyone! Hope to hear from you all soon :)

It was alumni weekend in college and ten of us were drinking around a restaurant table when an old friend walked through the door.  We all roared and he gave the closest guy to the door a high-five, which made everyone put their hands up as he went around the table slapping five. It was then that the idea for high-fives with confetti blasting out came to me as I thought of a way that moment could have been better!  Five years later, a lot of new friends, lessons in persistence, an appearance on the TODAY show, and incredible learning experiences paid off when the FiestaFive was born.  Google it.

I met my dream girl in middle school but was always too scared to approach her.  Thirteen years later we connected by random chance, then married in two years.  You can’t predict how an idea will strike you.  Love sometimes involves sharing interests as if they are your own, which introduced me to meal planning and prepping (cooking all your week's meals on Sunday).  After a few dreadful experiences while figuring out how much to cook between mine and my wife’s meal plans, grocery shopping, and cooking in bulk – I discovered a world of people committed to the hobby (read: lifestyle) and feeling my pain.  So, I developed MealPlanMagic: a one-of-a-kind tool that lets users build multiple meal plans with automated grocery and prep lists so you always buy and cook the perfect amount of food to meet your nutrition or body goals.  Check it out.

An effect of following through with your own ideas is being presented “great ideas” by others, the majority of which will sadly never be explored.  If you ever find yourself with an idea, do everything in your power to bring it to life!  You’ll always have purpose, continuously make friends, and be ever grateful for the things you’ll learn along the way.  I’ve always had a full-time job, so that's no excuse.  Ideas keep you sharp.

One of them was presenting myself; a young IT manager / web developer looking for new experiences.Now everything changed. Or only a few things.

So here is a few random things. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I married exactly three weeks ago, just came back from my honeymoon in USA. And I'm still looking for new, interesting, experiences.I love photography, only if I am not in the picture.I love traveling. Everywhere and in every possible way.I love musicals.

Stop with that buttercream frosting!Pizza or past with meatballs ARE NOT italian dishes. And neither is pizza with strange things in the crust.Try spaghetti Carbonara if you never did it - this recipe is good:

3 eggs50 g parmisan cheesesea saltblack pepper150 g pancetta200 g spaghetti1 clove of garlicextra virgin olive oil

Put the egg yolks into a bowl, finely grate in the Parmesan, season with pepper, then mix well with a fork and put to one side. Cut any hard skin off the pancetta and set aside, then chop the meat.

Cook the spaghetti in a large pan of boiling salted water until al dente. Meanwhile, rub the pancetta skin, if you have any, all over the base of a medium frying pan (this will add fantastic flavour, or use 1 tablespoon of oil instead), then place over a medium-high heat. Crush the garlic clove with the palm of your hand, add it to the pan and leave it to flavour the fat for a minute. Stir in the pancetta, then cook for 4 minutes, or until it starts to crisp up.

Pick out and discard the garlic from the pan, then, reserving some of the cooking water, drain and add the spaghetti. Toss well over the heat so it really soaks up all that lovely flavour, then remove the pan from the heat. Add a splash of the cooking water and toss well, season with pepper, then pour in the egg mixture – the pan will help to cook the egg gently, rather than scrambling it. Toss well, adding more cooking water until it’s lovely and glossy. Serve with a grating of Parmesan and an extra twist of pepper.

Now as a 42 year old woman, my longing to help has made me turn my eyes to the children and adolescents of my own indigenous people. During my lifetime I have realized that those are the ones my heart yearns to help.

Have you ever heard about the Sami people? If not, maybe you have heard about the Laplanders? I am one of them. I am Sami.

I was brought up in a reindeer herding family in the very north of Sweden where the chances for a girl to work with reindeer herding was unheard of in the community. I never got the question if I wanted to. That work was meant for boys who were stronger, the older people said. The girls were encouraged to study. So I left my reindeer herding family and pursued a career as a journalist.

But all the time I have longed to come back and give back to my Sami community. You see, I never got the chance to choose.

Now I want to help girls (and boys) to choose, to challenge the rules and make it possible for them to live the life they want. I want them to see the possibilities they possess. There is barely anything which supports the indigenous Sami people in Sweden. The Swedish government  has been severly criticized by the international community (UN/EU) for not treating the Sami people well.

So...I am crying while writing you this...

I am about to take the biggest risk I have ever taken in my entire life. All because of how much I wan to help and create change in my community, and to leave a legacy which can contribute to changing the rules, strengthening identities and empower girls and boys to follow their dreams.

I am starting an international foundation (registered in the USA) called Adopt a Reindeer and Save a Life. My vision is to help preserve the indigenous Sami culture by protecting native reindeer that are essential to the Sami way of life. The way it works is that people can adopt a reindeer or a herd and the donations will go back to supporting the indigenous Sami community with the focus on children and adolescents.

I am launching this foundation on November 1. I have invested a lot of time and money to figure it all out and as the time gets closer, my anxiety level climbs. Not many people around me here in Sweden know about this, since I am so scared to tell them. I don´t know how they will react. Remember, that I once was told that I was not good enough.

But I have decided to face the fear and do it anyway. So here it comes...

Would you like to help me?Is there a willingness and an interest to help me spread this message of hope and possibility? To help me help these girls and boys? To help me contribute to something that can improve and empower a whole community, a culture and even a tribe of People.

It would mean the world to me.  Contact me directly if you want to support us in any way or make a donation.

You’d know that you’re helping make someone’s dream come true and also helping to preserve an entire way of life – one that depends on the reindeer.

Luck is when preparation meets opportunity."" I've heard it other times since. Even though I never took the effort to look up where this quote originated or how common it is, it has always stuck with me. I'm not a big fan of ultimatums, but I do feel this statement has some truth to it.In my life I've felt everything happens for a reason. I'm very fortunate, which I think makes it easier for me to think along these lines than someone who has endured greater amounts of hardship than I have. But before shutting me out because you may not like how that sounds, I would say consider your hardships and failures. For me, these reinforce my belief more than the successes. I played college football, and one of the things I try to explain to people is one of the greatest lessons from that experience is that I learned how to lose. It does not always make sense initially but over time its very clear. I learned that every day is not your day. You're not meant to constantly flourish. Its how you learn from and respond to those downs. Some may be severe, some minor, but the more you take from them, the better prepared you are for opportunities that present themselves down the road. This becomes ""luck"", but it is really your ability to comprehend and retain things, then recognize them as they reappear in various ways. You create your luck.Now are plenty of things out of our control, yes aspects of the world around us are left to chance. I'm not denying that. But I would ask you to challenge yourself each time you consider yourself or someone else ""lucky"".I could go in thought circles about this forever but I'm going to cut it off because I dislike super long emails on the Listserve and I'm already halfway to my limit. Last thing, one of my favorite day dreams is imagining myself as a Foreign Exchange student from the US at Hogwarts. I just think that's pretty awesome, and now you know.Much love,

Their cheering at mile 20 provided the injection of energy I needed.  This was my first marathon – only 6 miles to go.  I ran on, bolstered by the confidence that came from knowing I had trained well. I was determined to finish strong despite my exhausted legs and the scorching June temperature.  A few miles later I got light-headed, chills swept over my body, my vision blurred...that’s all I remember….

When my eyes opened, the bright hospital lights blinded me. The fuzzy scene of my family and friends around me slowly came into clarity.  “Where am I?” I faintly whispered. “You were running and collapsed,” my dad said, gently caressing my hand. Mom didn’t say a word; her countenance dark with worry. “I love to run.” I muttered in response, completely unaware. Then it hit me – my marathon! What happened? Why was I here? I was devastated.  Mom handed me my GPS watch - 25.9 miles. I had collapsed a quarter mile from the finish line.

A friend sent this message - “Hey, I heard you went loopy at your marathon. My friend knows the woman who helped you.” I had no idea anyone had helped me! I didn’t even know what had happened and I was anxious to find out. I got the phone number for a woman named Paula and gave her a call. I wept in awe as she explained the part of the story I couldn’t remember.

She had been running the last few miles to support a friend when she saw me hobbling slowly along.  She encouraged her friend on and stopped to help me. When she approached I clumsily sat down. I told her my name was Ron (not my name), and I reached for a crack in the street. “Is this the finish line?” I asked.  It was obvious I was delirious and needed medical attention. The finish line was in sight so Paula and another man lifted me up, one on each side, and escorted me slowly toward the finish. With each step I got weaker and weaker until I slumped to the ground. My rescuers carried me to the side and yelled for someone to call 911. After propping me up against a tree, my eyes rolled to the back of my head and that was the end of my race.

--

I owe my life to my Paula. Through her selflessness I escaped death that day.  Words are inadequate to express how grateful I am and how indebted I feel to her. I was completely and utterly incapable of helping myself that day.  That was a very humbling feeling - one I had never really felt before, and one I will never forget.

When has someone done something for you that you couldn’t do for yourself?When has a friend, loved one, or stranger helped you when you needed it?Who are you grateful for? Inspired by? Feel indebted to?I’d love to hear your stories. Please share!

I've heard these reasons again and again:

* It just works* It is high quality hardware* It feels good

All of these seem highly subjective, and I don't really see anyone supporting them with hard facts or statistics. They seem overpriced at best, and irrelevant at worst. 

Take iTunes for instance. If you own multiple apple devices, unless you _really_ know what you are doing, you don't want to anything other than a one-to-one pairing of your device and your iTunes. I also never understood how any one who has used iTunes can claim that Apple products are ""easy to use"", or ""just work"". Apple products are also only convenient when you are perfectly aligned with what they consider standard, or their expected use cases. For instance, if you have a video that you want to copy to your device, you need your video to be in _exactly_ the right format, or go around fumbling with multiple video converters or video players.

Of course, I find it pretty likely that I'm just not ""getting it"". If you consider yourself an Apple fan, or you just like the product line, I would love to hear from you about why you are ready to pay the premium for Apple. I am particularly curious to know whether the people who buy Apple products do it just because they like it, or if they think the increase in quality is worth more than the increase in cost.

On the other hand, if your opinion is similar to mine, I would love to hear from you and know that I'm not alone :)

No, this email is about a hope I’ve found in the midst of a life of hopelessness.

From a very young age I’ve been accustomed to and understood that life isn’t within our control; there are very few guarantees in this blip we call “life”.

You see, growing up this way, however, taught me the one guarantee: death is promised. In a life full of questions—why is there pain? Why is there loss? Why does happiness—true happiness—seem so unattainable?—I found myself often thinking of the life after death—if there even was one. In my juvenile mind—so accustomed to loss and hurt—I had no clue where I would go when the promise of death reached fulfillment.

Death is guaranteed. You may be reading and asking, “Dani, where is the hope in that?” Well, reader, let me share with you where I found my hope.

By the time I was in high school, I dealt with a myriad of things all stemming from a desperate need for control and a terrifyingly misguided view of who I was. That was until I understood who I was in light of this promise of death. This hope is often referred to as the “Living Hope”; a Hope that brings light amidst the darkness and chaos of life.Another name for this hope is Jesus Christ. Now, reader, I promise I won’t preach at you. I won’t shove this down your throat. I merely wish to tell you my story,

I grew up thinking I wasn’t worth anything—thinking this world was better off without me. I grew up wanting to be rid of the pain and the loss that I had encountered in my short time on this earth. Until I understood and acknowledged a truth: I (and you) am so divinely created in the Image of the Almighty Creator that He—despite my sinful nature—chose to spare me from the just penalty of my depravity: hell. It wasn’t until I understood the free gift of grace extended to me that I finally began understanding—and seeing—the hope amidst hopelessness; it wasn’t until I understood the necessity of surrendering myself to Christ that I began to find freedom amidst chains; that I began to experience joy that surpassed all understanding.

It wasn’t until I understood the reality that choosing my own way in life would result in eternal separation from everything that is Good once the guarantee of life is fulfilled.

Reader, I have found hope—a Hope that never fails, that sustains, and that saves.You can too.

A joke:A teenage boy is getting ready to take his girlfriend to the prom. First he goes to rent a tux, but there’s a long tux line at the shop and it takes forever. Next, he has to get some flowers, so he heads over to the florist and there’s a huge flower line there. He waits forever but eventually gets the flowers. Then he heads out to rent a limo. Unfortunately, there’s a large limo line at the rental office, but he’s patient and gets the job done. Finally, the day of the prom comes. The two are dancing happily and his girlfriend is having a great time. When the song is over, she asks him to get her some punch, so he heads over to the punch table and there’s no punchline.

It was really hard to accept (and I literally cried my eyes out) but I think the secret of happiness – is understanding that you are the only person that can make you happy. You shouldn’t wait it from the others, you shouldn’t depend on them. You can’t force people to stay with you, and eventually the most right decision is to be grateful for happy moments shared with them and let them go.I hope these words will comfort some of you who are in similar situation.I’m very quiet and indecisive person but at the same time sometimes I do crazy things like travelling by hitchhiking or jumping with a parachute. I’d like to broaden my horizons. One of my ideas for this autumn is to visit Deftones concert in Berlin. Probably I’ll do hitchhiking again. If anyone from Berlin or from Germany in general could shelter me and my friend for a while – I would really appreciate that. Please give me a shout if you can help me with this.I like reading, music (in particular visiting of concerts), feminism and body positive, vegetarian and vegan cafes, bicycles and kick scooters. By the way I wonder – are kick scooters so popular (among the adults) in other cities? In Saint-Petersburg they are really popular, I guess it’s because we have flat streets J

Finally, the one thing I truly love is a poetry. I like unusual one, with a torn rhythm, with interesting rhymes. I like vers libre. I want to share with you one of my verse. It’s in Russian and I could translate it to the English but then I’m afraid I will exceed words limit. If anyone is interested – please write to me and I’ll send you a translation. I also would be glad to see your own poetry, guys. I didn’t read much in other languages besides Russian so I’d like to start from the poetry (and maybe it will inspire me to write in English as well).

A SHORT STORY: (based on personal experience)

Standing with the pebbles beneath my feet and sand between my toes, I looked out to sea, and contemplated life. I began thinking to myself; ‘What is it all for? What is it all about? What's even the point in living?’ The beach is one of my favourite places to be; the peacefulness makes me feel relaxed and blissful, a feeling I don’t usually get. As I looked out towards the azure sea, with the fulgent sun glinting in the water, I wondered what it would be like to be different. I wondered what it would feel like to be 'normal'. I thought about whether life would be better if I was different, and ‘normal’. I wondered whether life would be more bearable and clear sailing. Behind me, I heard the crunching of feet on bitty beach pebbles. I turned, to catch sight of Connor, my best friend. Connor loves me no matter what, and I am very thankful for that. But on this day, I was unsure what would happen between us.“What you doing?” asked Connor, in his friendly and kind voice.“Just thinking,” I replied, bluntly, with a sense of anguish in my voice.“What are you thinking about?” enquired Connor, again in a calm voice.“Just life. It’s rubbish, ain’t it?” I said, with even more dispiritedness in my voice.“What’s the matter?” asked Connor.I sat down in the sand, and threw a few stones into the sea.“You know you can tell me,” continued Connor in his soft, calming tone, before sitting down next to me and trying to get my attention.“Well, you know how like… well how…” I stumbled over my words, stuttering at every letter. For the first time in my life, I felt the inability to speak. “You know like……… how I’ve never really had a proper girlfriend or anything?”“Yes… come on, what’s the matter?” Connor asked patiently, still in his gentle tone.“Well…… I’m… I…. I’m gay,” I said. My voice petered out on the last word, and I looked in the other direction and broke down crying.After a pause, I faced Connor and we shared a warm hug. I wiped away my tears and tried to speak again normally.“So… you’re okay with it then?” I asked.“Of course I am. You’re my best friend. And you always will be” said Connor.Finally with my breath (and speech) back, I managed to just about stumble over the words: “wow, that’s a real relief.”

How astonishing it is that language can almost mean,and frightening that it does not quite. Love, we say,God, we say, Rome and Michiko, we write, and the wordsget it all wrong. We say bread and it means accordingto which nation. French has no word for home,and we have no word for strict pleasure. A peoplein northern India is dying out because their ancienttongue has no words for endearment. I dream of lostvocabularies that might express some of whatwe no longer can. Maybe the Etruscan texts wouldfinally explain why the couples on their tombsare smiling. And maybe not. When the thousandsof mysterious Sumerian tablets were translated,they seemed to be business records. But what if theyare poems or psalms? My joy is the same as twelveEthiopian goats standing silent in the morning light.O Lord, thou art slabs of salt and ingots of copper,as grand as ripe barley lithe under the wind's labor.Her breasts are six white oxen loaded with boltsof long-fibered Egyptian cotton. My love is a hundredpitchers of honey. Shiploads of thuya are whatmy body wants to say to your body. Giraffes are thisdesire in the dark. Perhaps the spiral Minoan scriptis not language but a map. What we feel most hasno name but amber, archers, cinnamon, horses, and birds.

My favorite part about traveling is visiting awesome vegan restaurants around the world.I'm not going to tell you about all of the issues with animal agriculture and the cruelties of factory farming. People seem to agree with these issues, but still support them because they believe that being vegan would mean giving up everything they like about eating. But actually, Vegans eat great food. I think that because we can't simply make food the way that everyone else does, it leads to vegan food being pretty creative.

My hope is that you will visit a vegan restaurant and experience vegan food; It will likely be an enjoyable experience. Using the website happycow.net, you can find vegan restaurants in your area. If you have a vegan friend, why not ask them what their favorite restaurant is. If you can't find a vegan restaurant near you, or you would rather cook, there are a ton of recipes available online at sites like http://www.theppk.com/recipes/

After you've experienced good vegan food, perhaps in the future you can think about the issues with animal agriculture without the oppressive feeling that there isn't anything you can do about it.

Feel free to email me about your experience with vegan food. Pictures of the meal are welcome :)

As a freelance journalist, over the years | have been lucky enough to interview and meet people I admire like Ridley Scott, Guillermo del Toro, Matt Groening, Mike Moorcock and many others. I have even gotten friendly with some of the people I have interviewed over the years like Walt Simonson, who wrote and drew a number of comics I have admired.As well as being a journalist, I am also a photographer and this is a skill that I have also honed thanks to the fact I am a journalist. It is the fact that I have a rapport with the subjects I interview and I have now reached a point where I am taking photos I am actually very proud of. I bought a camera just for reference for something and I am rather pleased that it seems I have an aptitude for taking photos, particularly portraits of creative people.With my portraits, I try to encapsulate the spirit and soul of the subject whether they’re writers, artists or even fellow photographers. I have had to shoot people with only a few minutes to compose the shot and there have been other occasions where I’ve had plenty of time. Making decisions on the hoof focuses the mind.I do have people I know who have regular jobs and sometimes I envy them but then there are moments when I get to do interesting things and meet people I have admired for years that I get to meet, often on an equal footing, and this makes it all worthwhile.I’d be happy to hear from other people who do work that they love.

One gloomy day in November, your requests will dictate my life. Inspired by WanderStomper.

Anyone can make requests, and I’ll document them online.

But I’m more likely to fulfill them if you let me know which (if any) of the below actions you've taken.  Each is described first with a bit of context. Apologies if the format is a bit confusing, hopefully you’ll read on…

Let’s go!

----------

In northern Thailand, kids ran around and played outdoors all day, it felt right. In a few years I’ll move back to Thailand and raise my future kids. This may be to an existing village or starting an ecovillage / school.

*If you are interested in visiting or being part of this community, Thailand is beautiful and you can probably save enough in the next few years to live without working there for a couple of decades. If you barter well enough (*check out Timebanks, they rock!!*) maybe you’ll never have to work again…*

----------

We felt bad because we didn’t have jobs, then we looked around and saw none of these other awesome people did either… We started Career Skills Incubator, it’s chill, fun, and flexible for the un(der)employed.

*Do you want to start a local branch? Or need tools to start your own mentorship program?*

----------

She developed SunSaluter as a teenager, increasing solar panel output while filtering water. The simple technology excited me. “I want to help, I’m probably not good enough for a response,” I thought, sending the email. A few months later they asked me to join their board.

*Check out SunSaluter if you know people who would be interested in partnering to deploy these with local entrepreneurs or non-profits around the world*

----------

Peering out of the castle where we lived, making the world better seemed the only viable path after this dizzying array of dance, laughter, new people and opinions.

*Learn about United World Colleges, including Online UWC, and encourage lower income youth to apply*

----------

We watched a beautiful video of Muslims and Jews praying together.

*Oct 11th in Toronto we’re bringing all faiths, including agnostics/atheists, together for an interfaith prayer for a better Canada, you’re welcome to attend and bring the whole family.*

----------

Yesterday was bi-visibility day, I didn’t do anything for it.

*Learn about LGBTTIQQ2S, polyamory…brainstorm what we can do to make the world more welcoming to for ‘marginalized’ people*

----------

I chickened out partway through the public Letter A Day goal, self-conscious about all I was sharing while trying to be politically correct.

*Write a letter to government, a company, a person, sharing what they do well and what they need to do better.*

----------

“Why are we supporting such BS companies??” I raged after learning about responsible investing, how even a couple bucks in a boring savings account might be used by banks to support companies whose values I don’t share…

*If you live in California, check out New Resource Bank, if not, let’s nerd out on this topic*

----------

I realized carbon, ecological, and water footprints should be measured together.

*Help me make the world’s first Full Footprint calculator and offsets, or its first competitor*

----------

My life goal? To decrease the negative environmental impacts of one million people.

*Share ideas, especially if you are an expert or passionate in areas e.g. efficient cookstoves, gravity lamps, kinetic energy from bikes to charge devices…*

----------

Let's make the world better, or at the very least tell me what to do with my life one dreary day in November.

Shukran. KupkoonKa. Gracias. Xixie.

He started using masculine pronouns when he was 2 years old.  At first I thought it was internalized misogyny, or misplaced older brother worship, but it wasn’t.  He’s a boy.  He lives as his preferred gender, he goes to school and ballet lessons and soccer, all as the boy he is.  He’s a happy kid.  He’s six years old.

His twin sister is a vegetarian.  She figured out where meat comes from when she was 5, and refused to eat any more of it.  I don’t try to sneak meat into what she eats, instead I make sure she has a nutritionally balanced diet without compromising her principles.

Here’s the thing I’ve realized: these small people do not belong to me, they belong to themselves.  My job isn’t to smash them into a box that doesn’t fit and never will, it’s to guide them through a sometimes hostile universe toward their best selves.  I'm learning how love works, and what obligations you have to it.

Ask me questions.  I’m listening.

October 2015,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/10/01/everyone-wants-validation/,"October 2015, 01",Everyone wants validation,"In high school, I felt like I ruled the world. I excelled in academics and was president of clubs. I felt like I was the shit. A couple years later in college, though, professors no longer praised me for my work and I felt unintelligent compared to my peers.  I know longer knew the answer to all the questions asked in class and everyone was a club president in high school. It felt like they knew everything and had already figured out their path, and I was still struggling to find out who I was and what I wanted to do with my life. I went from feeling like the shit to feeling like shit.

I soon started to compare myself to other people.  And I wanted to better myself, not for the sake of my own growth and development, but for the sake of simply being better than others. I soon found myself constantly worrying that I was falling behind and would not be able to catch up. I remember thinking, at times, my friend already has an internship at X prestigious firm, why don’t I? What am I doing wrong?

Eventually, that negative way of thinking drained the positive energy out of me and I knew I had to make some fundamental changes to my attitude. After listening to Ted talks and researching, I decided to slow down and listen to my heart and intuition more.  I have always known to make sure I listen and learn from others, but until that point I never realized that I should listen to my heart and understand what I truly want from life. Instead of participating in clubs that look good on a resume, I now participate in activities that I truly enjoy and I know I can add value to. Now when I take classes, I don’t beat myself up for not knowing the answer, but try to learn and gather knowledge to deepen my understanding

When I told some of my close friends my realization, after the initial eye-roll, they questioned whether I was going to lose my edge or Type-A personality; but in many ways I feel like I have enhanced my ability to focus and reach my goals.  By not worrying about what other people think or are doing, I am able to channel all my energy on matters I find important. Now I focus only on what I can control and what I believe will move me closer to what I want, both professionally and personally, to achieve in life.

Talking to my friends and peers, I came to realize this experience wasn’t an anomaly but rather a process many people go through. Often times, we feel alone in this world, opening up honestly about ourselves allows us to find the people who have experienced the same obstacles and who are willing to support us. I learned that my development is part of the journey of life.

Now, as a senior in college, I feel like I am more prepared to embark on the next phase of this journey.

I like connecting with people, so feel free to reach out!

September 2015,30,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/09/30/everyone-can-draw/,"September 2015, 30",Everyone can draw.,"Everyone can draw. Lots of people stop drawing when they don't have to do it at  school any more or because they think they can't do it.I'm an illustrator, so I draw for a living. A big part of that is that I just get to practise drawing an awful lot. Most people are just out of practice at it – if you hadn't driven or cooked for twenty years and then tried to all of a sudden, it would all feel a bit rusty until you got back into the swing of it. With the huge and slightly bizarre opportunity to talk to 23,000 people I think more than anything I'd like to get everyone to enjoy the pleasure in drawing something, particularly if you haven't drawn for years.

Don't worry about what it looks like or how much it resembles what you're drawing, just enjoy the process. Drawing what you see or experience every day is more what I mean. It's more like keeping a diary than writing a novel. It could be of anything at all. What's in front of you now? If you go out for a walk or look in your kitchen drawer or look out of the window, what do you see?

A couple of tips that I've found helpful:1. Look at what is actually there in front of you, not what you think that object looks like. What shape is actually there in front of you? What angle is that line really?2. Try not erasing anything. Keep going and if you're not happy with a bit of it draw it right over the top – this way you don't get bogged down in getting it perfect. Another way to stop you getting bogged down like that is to give yourself a reasonably short time limit.3. Draw on anything with anything. You don't need fancy equipment to get started - a sheet of paper out of your printer is fine. You may well find the best drawings you do are on the back of an envelope with a free Biro because you're more relaxed about it.

Most importantly, try and enjoy it. People are writers every day with their emails/Twitter/Facebook statuses - why not try treating drawing the same way?

It would be great to see all your drawings together (although don't feel you have to publish them!). I reckon posting it on Twitter under the hashtag #thelistservedrawings might be a good way to see them. See you on there if you like - I'm @laura_barnard.

Basically my foot went straight down from my leg instead of out front of it. After 7 surgeries before the age of 5 It was back to a pretty much normal foot. I was told I would never break 5 feet tall because of this. Here I am at 36 years old standing almost 5'9"" and with no discernible limp. I never met my father. He and my mother ended their engagement before she was aware she was pregnant with me. I went through most of my life believing he was just my mother's coke dealer and not much more. It wasn't until my 20's I found out that's just how they met but later got engaged. I was lucky enough that she found a great husband who raised me like his own flesh and blood and never made me feel less than my brother.

When I was 12 years old my parents decided I should go to a Pentecostal Christian School. After three years there I was very happy to go back to public schools. Although I feel that I would never make a child go to a school like that it broadened my horizons. When someone tries to use religion as an excuse for hateful or bigoted actions I'm capable of actually speaking from experience why they are wrong to use it like that.

My senior year of high school, I met the girl of my dreams. Of course, she was dating my friend at the time. I was young and stupid and cheated on her and we would break up and get back together many times more. Somehow, 18 years later we're still extremely close friends after all we've done to each other.

On a few occasions now I've had fate intervene in such a way that I'm amazed I'm still alive. In August of 2012 I put a car into wall at 40ish mph. I was not wearing a seatbelt and shattered the dashboard with my chin and the windshield with my forehead. Somehow I walked away with only needing 13 stitches. Six months after that a friend's inability to find a babysitter kept me from going to see Great White at The Station nightclub. I was up all night watching the horror unfold as 100 people lost their lives and 200 more were injured in that tragic fire.

Now I live in one of the greatest cities that most people couldn't find on a map. I have a lot of pride in both the city of Providence and the state of Rhode Island in general. I sometimes end up becoming a tour guide for random strangers I meet on my travels in the city. Everyone should try to do that with their own city. Show strangers around and let them make you love where you live over and over again. If you ever want a tour, I'm always up for showing more people this great city.

Fun Facts about Rhode Island:We have the First Baptist church in AmericaRhode Island was founded to escape religious persecution by the PilgrimsA full year and a half before some Boston guys made a huge pot of tea in the harbor Rhode Islanders burned a British customs ship, The Gaspee, to the waterline.We were the first to declare Independence and the last to sign the Constitution. Rhode Islanders have always been very independent.

If you ever come to Providence make sure you visit the Wickenden Pub and check out the paintings on the back patio.

The teachers seemed to incorrectly presume I preferred to be and work alone.When I finally got my diploma, I went to university and had a marvellous introductory week. I had finally made friends. In my first year, I saw them regularly. In the second and third year, it slowly melted away again. There was a nice board game night every now and then, but that was about it. Last year, I spent most evenings alone and sometimes even cried because of my lack of contact. I hope this academic year is going to be better socially.

One of my salvations has been a Dutch game forum I joined in 2009. In its pleasant online environment I could unleash all my sadness and frustration at the off topic parts of the forum and people would always be extremely supportive. Still, I was extremely hesitant to go and meet people I knew there. I had met single members twice for only five minutes, years ago, and both meetings were extremely awkward. Then, March this year, one member did really want to meet me (and vice versa) and he travelled all the way to my city to meet me. I had never been so nervous in my life, but the moment I looked him in the eyes I knew there was nothing to be afraid of.Last summer, I finally went to an entire week’s holiday just with members of the forum and, well, I now think it was probably the best week of my life. I regret not going to any forum meetings much earlier, but I couldn’t be happier to be ‘let in’ so easily.

Lastly, I’d like to tell you about the sport I practice. Bridge. I know what you’re thinking; that’s for old ladies, right? Well, not just. Old ladies practice it as a pleasant activity, while younger players like me see it as a sport. I’ve been a member of my local bridge club since 2008. Me and my then bridge partner were the only youth members of the club back then. Luckily, the number of youth players has risen (actually in the whole country) since then so we’re not alone anymore. I practice bridge as a serious sport, and last November we miraculously became Dutch National Youth Team champions. But it has brought me many more things, including a bit of social contact. The other youth players are all nice guys although I am not sure whether I can consider them my friends, almost never seeing them outside of the playing rooms.

-       Need a new hobby or sport, and do you like games in general? Try bridge. You won’t regret it. I can advise you.

-       If I think I have a friend, I am never certain whether that person feels the same and how we can do things together. I mostly not dare to ask them. If you think you have a really good piece of advice for anything, please be my guest. How do you define friendship?

When I was born, the internet had already been invented. I don't remember a time when it didn't have a presence in my life; I've been hanging out on the internet for basically as long as I've been sapient. I can split my childhood into stages based on where on the Internet I made my home. 

First, when I was very small, there was Webkinz, and then Neopets. I look back on those sites with nostalgia, but I was too young for them to have an impact on my life. My first real community, at age ~eleven, was this site called Taste of Awesome. They posted ""funny"" pictures, but really only had a few old, tired jokes. One day I clicked onto page one thousand and whatever and I thought to myself, wow. This really isn't funny. I closed the window and never looked back.

The next place I found was Tumblr. The social justice community was new to me; it talked about fighting against oppression and injustice and I was totally, 100% hooked. I waited eagerly to turn thirteen so I could make my own account and post my own cool thoughts about social justice! It took me a while to become disillusioned; I felt that the community I loved had become less about real justice and more about semantics and power struggles. It just wasn't the same. I left for my next community: the rationalists.

Rationalism espouses thinking about your own failings and biases, and striving to make both yourself and the world less irrational. What really speaks to me is the willingness of the community to accept differences, to argue, and to be wrong. It's just a bunch of smart people, spread out over blogs and Tumblr and rationalist-specific websites, all trying to make life better. 

Everyone needs a community, and I've had quite a few in my life. Right now, it's rationalism (google ""Rationality: From AI to Zombies"" if you want to learn more.) Part of what I love about growing up on the internet is the freedom to change who I am as I grow; to choose my own community, not based on geography or the circumstances of my birth, but on what makes me happy. Today, it makes me happy that we live in a world where people can argue and disagree, and all the while be trying to make the world a better place.

I think humanity's got it pretty good. Don't you? 

Have a great day.

September 2015,25,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/09/25/live-where-you-feel-inspired/,"September 2015, 25",Live where you feel inspired,"My wife and I are city people. Though we developed this predisposition in different ways (she grew up in a city of 3+ million - it didn't happen to me until college), we both have the need to feel the world buzzing around us. Being artists, we need to feel as though life is happening around us to feel alive and inspired, to feed our mind and our soul. We're happiest with a drink in hand, surrounded by both friends and strangers, sharing stories and existing among the diverse community of human beings that inhabit the world at this precise, special moment in time.

So naturally we moved to a super-quiet town in northern Massachusetts when we first moved in together. Population: 8,000. There was a total of one skeevy dive bar within 15 miles. No public transport. Heaven, right?

It was maddening. If not for the proximity to my job and the rent value for the dollar I'm fairly certainly we would have been out of there in a matter of a few short months. But we gutted it out for an entire year until the lease was up. And when my wife landed a job closer to Boston, we took the first opportunity we had and shacked up in an apartment at nearly double the rent just 15 minutes from her work and an 8 minute drive from the nearest subway station. Things were finally looking like our city-itch would be scratched. We thought as much, at least.

Over the past 10 months we've come to realize that the plague of suburbia can exist even a few short minutes away from the subway.

Watch: TED2004 - James Howard Kunstler: ""The Ghastly Tragedy of the Suburbs""

What we got instead was the boring lovechild of our former town and the outskirts of Boston - no real bars, just Italian restaurants that close at 10pm - no young people, just former urbanites that decided to ""settle down"" yet still be a train's distance away from their old stomping grounds. And it's not as though Boston has an outstanding nightlife in its own right. Even if we decided to hop into Boston for a night on the town... last I checked the subway stops running at 12:30am. Stay later than that, and you're a candidate for a taxi or uber ride that'll cost you anywhere from 5-20x the cost a subway ride.

If New York is the city that never sleeps, Boston is the city that gets a solid 8 hours a night.

My wife and I went to London for a friend's wedding this month. Needless to say, we would move there today if we could.

I don't think I've ever felt as inspired as I did in those brief 6 days we spent in London. It genuinely felt like something inside me had been reawakened, something that I had lost in our two years in purgatory. I saw shape, color, and life. Dots connected in my brain that had been languishing apart from each other as I wasted away in the backwoods and urban backwoods of Massachusetts. I felt wanted by the world around me rather than it being bothered by me. For me, in London, the world's arms were open and my heart was smiling.

I’d love some tips from anyone who’s made the jump to London or is currently living there. Additionally, if anyone may be interested in being a roommate to a professional couple in London in the near future, shoot me a message.

Live where you feel inspired, and you’ll live an inspired life.

Cheers,

The attitude of being lucky makes youmore likely to see the opportunities that exist around you.That’s been a theme for my life. I choose to believe I’m lucky.

I win contests, just because I enter more contests than other people.I get jobs and freelance gigs just because I take the time to ask andapply when others don’t.

I fail, and I fail a lot, but failure isn’t fatal. But because I tryin situations where other people are afraid to do so (or don’t see thechance), I get opportunities that other people don’t.

If you take a lesson from my life, look for the opportunities you’remissing. Take a chance and you might find the opportunity to getexactly what you want in life. If you think of yourself as lucky andyou start looking at the world around you in a different way, youmight just become lucky. Give yourself permission and it could happen.

And with the chance to write for the Listserve, I had to try askingfor a chance myself. I would love to write movie scripts. Does anyonehave any suggestions on how to get started with that?

If you need a fresh set of eyes for anything in your life, reach outand maybe I can help you figure out how to be a lucky person too.

It is with great anticipation that we minions of Hell read your emails daily. Your pleas for advice and intimacy are simply delightful. Your desperate attempts to distract yourselves from the meaningless vacuum of mortality…delicious. We are your biggest fans. On behalf of Recruitment and Retention, I thank you for this chance to address you all, and, if I may be so bold, perhaps, reduce your suffering?

Why be satisfied with the ephemera of cat videos and Emo? Why rely solely on snatches of poetry and Paulo Coelho when, with just a few drops of blood, all obstacles can be rendered obsolete?

Would you like the answer to the Universe’s burning mysteries?Does your ex deserve an untreatable strain of genital wart?Would you like to be paid for your internship?

Well, boy, does the Dark Lord have a fantastic offer for you! A simple swap: a soul for success.

We know that over the centuries Hell’s reputation as an upstanding and trustworthy organization has been tarnished. No one is more aware of the need for change than the Dark Lord himself. After completing an online MBA this June, Satan has overseen a complete re-org and we are bringing new opportunities directly to you!

Now you may be thinking: Mephistopheles, I have many people that need killing but I don’t want to give up my soul for eternity. Do you have an option for me?

Yes! Under our new Soul Licensing Agreement, you have the opportunity to earn back your soul. It’s our new Damnation And Salvation approach to demonic assistance.

Earn? Mephistopheles, what could I possibly offer that Hell does not already possess?

Another worthy question, ListServant. The answer: friends and family. Friends and family with souls! Each of your social networking presences could become the perfect platform to put you back on the path to soul ownership. At a 5% recuperation rate per soul harvested, in as little as twenty souls you may be back in God’s good graces.*

But Mephistopheles, I’m a stay-at-home mother with six bratty children, I don’t have time to harvest the souls of my high school friends and dead-beat cousins. What can I do?

As a mark of his true genius, Satan has a plan for you, too. For any of your harvested souls that enroll in the D&S plan, you will earn 5% of their soul recuperation. 0.25% of a soul for sitting at home watching Ellen. How generous is that!?! Harvest two or three, really well-networked souls, and you will see dividends from their attempts to reclaim their soul for eternity!

Just think about your old roommate, y’know the righteous one with the big family, the one who’s forever guilting people into doing stupid stuff, then complaining about how they do it. If you could just sign her soul, you know she’ll earn both of yours back in no time!*

Damnation and salvation as promised.

In short, when you’re looking in the mirror tonight, just consider a glorious future of indentured servitude to the Dark Lord. We are always on standby and await your summoning.

*Souls entered into the Damnation and Salvation program are subject to a 21.88% interest rate compounded annually

Environmental Paving Solutions, LLC was started and focused on porous and sustainable pavements, along with concrete sidewalks (our family livelihood since the 1920's).

Porous pavements act the same as standard pavements but designed with gaps between the aggregate that allow water to flow through and into the ground. Did you know that a lot of our cities pipe rainwater to the same sewer line that comes from your house? This combined sewer then has to be treated ($) and during large rain events this combined sewer will overflow into our waterways. This means that perfectly clean rain gets combined with sewage and then dumped into our rivers and lakes! Porous pavements, and other green infrastructure work to deliver this water back to ground, where it recharges our drinking water.   

EPS also works with products I call sustainable. We have an ""asphalt"" that uses polymers and tree sap instead of oil based tar. A concrete overlay system that allows you to get new looking patio or garage floor without having to rip it all out and start new (like recycling your concrete pad). We even have a porous pavement made with recycled tires! But our biggest seller is the good old fashion concrete sidewalks we have been installing since the 1920's.  

Thank you sidewalks, and thank you listserve.

September 2015,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/09/19/whats-in-a-name/,"September 2015, 19",What’s in a name?,"Wow. (I know, I know- replace with <I won the listserve cliché> of your choosing.)I'm pretty short on recorded musings, these days. Though, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have a list of ideas ready for this occasion. I’d also be lying if I said the list was anything more than one line that read “what’s in a name?”

To be honest, I’ve forgotten the specific origin of the thought. It’s something that I’ve always been intrigued by. There’s a lifetime's worth of unique experiences distillable to a moniker externally endowed, the meaning of which is subject to wide breadth of interpretations and vacilations, with a longevity that far surpasses your own. How can something so simple be so powerful?

I recently had a discussion with a close friend of mine. She’d asked me if I've ever thought of what I would name my children. (I’m 25.) I replied with the (however contrived) truth: I would name my first son after my father.

“Don’t you want him to have his his own identity?” (paraphrased, but with point intact)

Hmm. I’d never thought of it that way before. Even as someone who was partially named after his father*, I’ve always felt like I have/had control over my own legacy. But as the conversation continued, my conviction began to waver ever so slightly. (I did not let on at the time.) I’ve never felt as though my identity was predicated on my father’s, but can I be certain that this “idea"" of a person would feel the same? How comfortable was I with taking that chance?

Does your name have the power to define you? Or do you define your name? I’d be interested to hear your thoughts/experiences!

You can find me on twitter/instagram as @phillmatic19.

I’ll leave you with a song that I’ve always loved: 'So Come Back, I Am Waiting' by Okkervil River. (It’s about 8 minutes long but you won’t regret it.)

It's difficult to explain a lot of the gender stuff so if you're truly interested in the trans perspective or have questions I'd rather have a back and forth conversation than try crystallizing so many emotions and circumstances in a single one-way message to tons of individuals with markedly different world views.

I'll leave you with some information I found very interesting. There are 5 metrics I know of to define human sexuality:

September 2015,17,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/09/17/swaziland/,"September 2015, 17",Swaziland.,"So in short. I was born in London, grew up in Swaziland and Johannesburg, and moved to Florida when I was 9 years old. I now consider America my home, but I left my heart in Swaziland many years ago.

The years I lived in Swazi were wondrous. While I was so young, it was an impressionable age and I couldn't have asked for a better childhood home and environment. It has been difficult for me to explain the impact this tiny Kingdom has had on me, so I have been trying for 3 years now to put it into a story. It is fictional story, but inspired by true people and a true setting. I have never told a soul about this, but I figured it is much easier to share my first written words with thousands of people I don't know and a few I do.

This is the introduction, and a very rough draft.

------------------------

Our home sat on a beautiful and spacious piece of land in the mountains of Swaziland. I remember the feeling of the rough, patchy grass prickling against my feet as I ran from one hilly end of our backyard all the way to where the swings and jungle gym sat. It was a long stretch of ground to cover for my little legs, but I loved being outdoors and exploring the wonders and dangers that existed behind my house, and deep into the woods. Our backyard stretched down a small hill where it met a scary yet enticing pond that was haplessly surrounded by stinging nettle plants. My sisters and I had some unfortunate run-ins with those plants as we attempted to fearlessly get past the barricade they had grown over the years. This pond was a reminder of the line we were never allowed to cross, both determined by nature and our parents. Lining our property on the right side was a small swimming pool and a row of beautiful banana trees. Oh, those banana trees. My mother had planted them the day she and my father laid the first brick of our home. Behind the pond was the most majestic backdrop of rough and rocky mountains that turned lush-green as they cascaded to the bottom of the Earth. Scattered in small clumps in the distance were small, flat-roofed houses that were all constructed out of the same corrugated iron material indigenous to Swazi. They were similar in structure and size, but different in small ways: one family had painted the left side of their house a bright mint green color, while another had a cherry red door. If I squinted really hard, I was able to see the mothers hanging up their family’s freshly-laundered clothes on the white lines draping from one end of their house to another. I would smile and think of Thandiwe.

I remember helping her around the house with the laundry or cleaning. It was our time. We had been together since I was a baby when she would swaddle me in a blanket and cautiously throw me on her back while doing the housework. Mama hated that I bothered Thandiwe and always told me to go finish my homework or play outside. But I never did. I always insisted on her bathing me every night, and while she lathered the slimey soap bar all over my body and washed my hair, she would sing me our special Xhosa lullaby.

The End...for now.

I'm Tula and I'm a first-year chemistry student. When I knew I eventually had to choose a study, I totally freaked out. Because I loved sciences, but I also liked history and also worked at a cultural youth organization where I organized all kinds of cultural events, for example a 'poetry palooza' (see urban dictionary for the exact meaning of 'palooza'). 

Eventually I decided I wanted to study chemistry, for all kinds of reasons I won't bore you with. Not long after that decision I found, by accident, a Master's that got my attention:

""Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage""

This would mean I'd get to restore art! This way I could combine my love for science and art! I don't know how much you know about Amsterdam. But there's one museum that almost always has a line.. Het Rijksmuseum. This is where the Night Watch by Rembrandt is exhibited. The Master's is a collaboration between the university and this amazing museum! 

Now why am I telling you all this? These are my reasons:

- I never thought of restoration of art when I thought of chemistry and this shows that when you choose a study or a job, it never has to mean you can't do something totally different with that study or after that job. - If anyone has articles, information or anything else on this topic I would love to receive that. My e-mail is , I'd love to hear from you!- Also anything else on the topic of art or chemistry you think I should see or read is welcome!- I also want to encourage people who have to make an important choice right now or in the foreseeable future, because I'm the worst when it comes to making these kind of choices, but I did it! So you can absolutely do it too!

So, this is it, 

lots of love,

It had a pleasant atmosphere, great Indian food and amazing people.

A couple of weeks ago I've invited my friend James to host this dinner together. We decided on the time, place and then each of us invited their guests. We hosted it to stay in touch with people we consider valuable, who we'd like to spend more time with. The trick is that they are not from our closest circle, thus it's a wee bit harder (a day is only 24 hours long after all).

At the same time we used the opportunity to meet new people and that's why we hosted this meeting together, James and I. We handpicked the guests, so they had a guarantee that people they meet are worth their time. Maybe they will not become great friends (and maybe they will), but for sure there was a chance to do some business, discuss projects, get advice etc.

Of course there's a lot more people we'd like to stay in touch with and that's why we're planning on making these meetings recurring. The idea is to host them always in pairs, but everytime different ones and everytime with a different set of guests. This way we can stay in touch with more of our friends, get to know more people and infuse more people with the same idea. So at the end of the meeting James and I, each of us asked one person to co-host the next meetings. So next time we’ll have 2 separate meetings hosted. We’ll strive to always have 2 hosts and always have these hosts create the next meetups. It will be up to the participants if they’d like to do join though.

So there are 2 rules:- always 2 hosts,- each invites 4 guests.And then just let the conversations begin. We (the hosts) also did 5-min talks in the topics of common sense and presentation skills, just to give some more value to the participants.

Use the idea if you like it. I for sure do and will continue hosting these dinners.

Cheers,

I’d like to tell you about when I was around six years old… I broke my arm after attempting to do a “what not to do” karate move for my sister (Hi Kel , I won the Listserve and it was really hard to keep it from you but I wanted it to be a surprise) . I remember my mother taking me to the emergency room and being so concerned, I also remember eating the best tasting bomb pop of my life. That was when I realized I wouldn’t be able to live without my mother. In my six year old mind set it was made up, if anything happened to my mother I would just take my own life. My mother died 14 years later. It brought back the fears I had when I was younger. How can I do this? How can a person go on without their mother. I only had her for 20 years. What I didn’t realize until a few months later is that I was actually lucky. No, I’m not lucky that my mother died…I am lucky that I knew her for 20 whole years. Some people never have a mother, some people lose their mother at an earlier age than I did. I should be happy I got to spend those 20 years with her. Which brings me to my ongoing fear of death – I think about it quite often. Today is September 11, 2015, a day which brings out that fear in many people. I stay up at night thinking about how it will feel to die, kids that are starving in Africa, human trafficking and various other stressful things. I need a better way to manage my thoughts .

I’ll switch gears and talk about fun stuff . I am envious at the travel stories other Listserve authors have provided. I have only been out of my country  (USA) internationally to travel to Canada ! I feel now that I may be too old to go to all of the places I want to go ( I am 31 ! ) France, I’m looking at you !  I don’t have any words of wisdom, wait, maybe I do . Recycle, wait, no… don’t recycle, yes, do recycle. Don’t waste food – my family taught me the importance of this , when you have food you don’t think of how precious it really is. Didn’t finish the green beans from dinner tonight, I bet they would go well in a vegetable soup tomorrow. It makes me cringe when I see people toss perfectly edible food.

I’d like to give a should out to my cat, Pit-Pat , too bad she can’t read. I feel lucky to be alive but I am sad that I am getting old. I long for the days of simplicity…hanging out on the front porch till 4am, talking, not worrying about if I’m going to have enough money to pay my bills every month. I didn’t take it all in when I was young, and it hit me like a ton of bricks as I got older. I love the city I live in (Pittsburgh, PA), but I would rather be living in Texas !  Tell the important people in your life how much they mean to you,  a small gesture goes a long way. Be kind and root for the Pittsburgh Pirates . Feel free to keep in contact.

Google the Milgram experiment to find out more about this tendency to obey authority. Find out more about obedience studies and how this tendency in human beings leads to all kinds of horrors. Think about your own responses to the world and whether you would obey authorities and follow orders that you didn't agree with. Think about how you can free yourself from the programming that we are surrounded by in the 21st century. Try to learn to think for yourself. It's harder than it sounds - we all get trapped in the dominant belief systems of our times and it can be very difficult to transcend them.These experiments took place in the '60s and '70s. I'd like to think that things are changing and that in the internet age, it's harder to lie to people and that people growing up today are more likely to question authorities and less likely to follow orders that conflict with their own morality. I hope so. What do you think?-------------------------------------------------------------------I've lived most of my life in Durban, South Africa, and currently live in Berlin. Last year in Durban and around South Africa, there was a violent and heart-breaking eruption of xenophobia against Africans from outside the country, in which several people lost their lives. The whole city shut down for a day or two as a result, with the highway into the city itself being closed off and a terrible climate of fear and despair prevailing. Things got better and the ghost of genocide and horror slowly dissipated.Watching the refugee crisis in Europe at the moment, I am reminded of a similar feeling. But it's been deeply heartwarming to witness the embrace of refugees by communities across Europe, even as Hungary continues to install a razor-wire border to stop the Syrian refugees from making their way to safety.It has long seemed to me that there is a planetary war between the forces of love and compassion and the forces of profit and destruction. Although human consciousness has radically expanded in my lifetime (I'm 44, born in 1971), I often feel that the forces of darkness are winning. The embrace of the refugees by hundreds of thousands of people in Europe has shone light into that darkness and it feels, even if just for now, like love is taking the upper hand. And I pray that that love will spread.-------------------------------------------------------------------So don't be a robot. Think for yourself. Practice love and compassion. Make kindness your religion. And let these forces of positivity spread like wildfire. We can make this world a better place. We can save it. We can save ourselves.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm a writer and artist.

I'm 22 and currently working with an Ad network. One year into being a working professional, things haven't turned out the way it should have and I've realized that they never will be because something better is always planned for us.

I need your help. I have a recurring shoulder dislocation and must have dislocated it atleast 10-15 times. The situation is so bad that sometimes it gets dislocated while sleeping. I am in a really bad situation and would like your help so that I could get back to playing soccer. I haven't played any sport since the past two years and would really, really like to get back. If there are any orthopedics reading this or if you know any of your friend who is an orthopedic it would be really nice if you could connect with me and guide me on how to tackle this issue. My parents are also tired and we have no idea what to do. Hope to receive some replies.

Alright, chuck this. 

I love traveling and I'm interested in photography. Feel free to check my account on Instagram: devinbhatia93. If you are planning to come to Mumbai, feel free to drop me a message so that we could meet and I could show you around.

TIM:                            Dennis, what's the status on this job?  It's been in the queue for months.

DENNIS:                    Yes it has, Tim.  It's a lower priority.

TIM:                            Well, why is it not done?  How long could it possibly take you to do this?

DENNIS:                    Like I started to say, the jobs I have been able to complete are all greater priorities.  Are you taking them into consideration when you ask?

TIM:                            None of that matters here.  I'm only asking about this job.

DENNIS:                    All right then.  It's not done, Tim, because we don't have nearly enough staff to keep up with all the work coming in.  You know this.

TIM:                            Well, this is all Corporate will give us.  We have this many manhours to work with.

DENNIS:                    Then obviously it's not all going to be tended.  Some things will have to go neglected.  The low-priority job before us, for examp—

TIM:                            Unacceptable.  How do we support our customers with the resources we have?

DENNIS:                    Tim, it's a simple matter of arithmetic.  We have this much work coming in.  Each job at a bare minimum takes x amount of time.  You might as well ask how to make two plus two equal five.

TIM:                            Well, our management dictates it, so how do we go about making two plus two equal five?

DENNIS:                    <rubs temples>

TIM:                            You know, all I'm asking for is a little cooperation.  You talk about promotion during your yearly review, I need a little cooperation from you.

DENNIS [patiently]:  Okay Tim.  I am trying to explain the facts to you as they are.

TIM:                            You're a Negative Nancy.  Try to think positive.

DENNIS:                    Doesn't matter how you think about it, Tim.  Two plus two will only ever equal four.  Acknowledging that reality shouldn't make me a pessimist.

TIM:                            [calls out] Daniel, could you come in here?

DANIEL:                    Sure, boss!  What can I do ya for, amigo?  Heh heh heh.

TIM:                            We're talking about our workload.  How long would it take you to complete this job?

DENNIS:                    Tim, as I've said before, we have to priorit—

DANIEL:                    This job?  This would take me three seconds.

TIM:                            Dennis here hasn't done the job yet and he's had months!

DANIEL:                    Heh heh heh.

DENNIS:                    Listen!  First of all—

TIM:                            Daniel, I bet you could you make two plus two equal five.

DANIEL:                    Well let me think.  What if we stretched the twos?  Wouldn't that help?

TIM:                            See?  Now THAT's the kind of innovation we need around here!  We could stretch the numbers!  That would almost give us five.

DENNIS:                    Hey retards!  Forty hours still equals forty hours!  The only way to believe otherwise is to willfully deny reality.

TIM:                            I choose to reject your negativity.  I like the things I'm hearing from Daniel much more.  Daniel, you're hereby promoted above Dennis.

DENNIS:                    If you want to behave responsibly, Tim, you will tell Corporate the truth.  If they want five out of us, they'll have to give us more than two plus two.

TIM:                            Actually they want a hundred.  We really have to make two plus two equal one hundred.

DENNIS:                    Even one as deluded as you can see that is impossible.

TIM:                            Nope!  How do we make two plus two equal a hundred?  Daniel?

DANIEL:                    I think what Dennis is trying to say is he thinks it’s impossible.  But what if we morphed the twos into sevens?  Won't that get us almost to a hundred?

TIM:                            YES!   Daniel you are promoted again!

DENNIS:                    I can't participate in this lunacy.

September 2015,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/09/09/mmm-tasty-penguin/,"September 2015, 09","""Mmm, tasty penguin!""","My parents took me to an aquarium as a child, the kind that had a dolphin show, and a whole section of Antarctic animals. My memory is hazy, but there was an outdoor enclosure for the penguins, and I remember peering, my little face pressed up against the glass, fascinated. They asked me if I liked the penguins, and I gleefully exclaimed, ""Mmm, tasty penguin!""

The shock! People around with other children looked askance. Who was this monster child who saw adorable penguins and immediately thought about cooking them?

""No,"" my parents frantically explained. ""We don't eat penguins!"" I must have smiled and nodded in some way that convinced them I wasn't some penguin-eating freak, or a killer whale in disguise. We continued on to the gift shop, where I picked out a reasonably sized stuffed penguin to take home. Maybe they figured I was making amends, because I bought it and cuddled it all the way back to our house.

A few hours later, my mother came to check on me. I'd shoved the stuffed penguin in my pretend oven, and I dramatically opened it up and shouted, ""tasty penguin!"" again. I'd fooled my easily trusting parents, and now I had a penguin all my own to cook. I don't know how they eventually broke me of my penguin-cooking obsession, but at some point after that I moved on to using a tiny faux blender to prepare a mixture of Cheerios and water that only my younger brother was gullible enough to actually eat, but back then he'd do anything I say. 

He's a dad now, and I took my nephew to the aquarium just before his first birthday, and crawled into the penguin exhibit with him, a series of tunnels so you can be right at penguin level. The nephew can't talk yet, so no inappropriate outbursts, but I did get him his own stuffed penguin, just to see if this runs in the family.

I've told this story about myself for years, but it's taken me until tonight, at 31, thinking about what to share with this Listserve, for me to actually search and see if penguin is edible. It's considered contraband, which makes me feel like even more of a preschool rebel. However, people have and do eat them in particular locations and circumstances (see Frederick Cook's 1897 excursion and how it helped them avoid scurvy), just not small children on day trips in Rhode Island.

If you are wondering what penguin allegedly tastes like, the Internet says it's akin to veal.--

""I am the one thing in life I can control/I am an inimitable, I am an original/ I'm not falling behind or running late / I'm not standing still, I am lying wait."" - Lin-Manuel Miranda, Hamilton. 

(Sung by Aaron Burr's character in the song ""Wait For It"" during the first act.) 

(Possibly off by a word or two since the album is not released yet, forgive me Lin if I'm misquoting.) 

(By god, if you get the chance to see the show on Broadway, see it.)

--

When not telling somewhat embarrassing tales of my penguin-eating childhood, I write about digital entertainment and emerging platforms for The Daily Dot. I'm always interested in hearing what others think the future of pop culture and entertainment holds, especially with a younger demographic that prizes digital stars over what we consider mainstream and traditional. Are the two forms in competition, or can they coexist? I'd love to hear your views.

It's a bot. Here's how it works:

* Follow @TheTweetserve to see what it's posting.

* Mention @TheTweetserve to join the retweet lottery. Every few hours it retweets one of the last 200 people who mentioned it and follow it.

If this sounds a little complicated, it's because I would like @TheTweetserve to respect your privacy. You only get retweeted if you BOTH follow and have mentioned @TheTweetserve.

Besides that, two books that are very underrated in my opinion are The Ethics of Ambiguity, by Simone de Beauvoir and Dictionary of the Khazars, by Milorad Pavić.

Here's something I learned recently that I wish I had understood better a long time ago:

The world is full of belief systems that people have written down. I've spent a lot of time trying to solve the question of what to believe by solving the riddle posed by those writings.

I would read one thing, then try to find where it contradicts something else, and so on. Same with the ideas and values people would tell me. I would go out of my way to find more and different people to collect new ideas and try to fit them into the jigsaw puzzle with all the other ideas.

I don't recommend doing this. It is based on an incorrect assumption that words mean something when removed from their context. This is especially a problem with all the words on the Internet. What's the context? Who knows?!

Words happen because they are tools to hold particular social contexts together. Their meaning is situated. And the beliefs they express are habits of behavior suitable to a context. It's the easiest thing in the world to take ones beliefs and misapply them out of context.

I'm not saying there is no Truth. I still think there is. It's just that the more you know about it, the less there is to say.

I came to this conclusion *after* I designed and built @TheTweetserve. It's ironic, actually, to have this opportunity to tell you both about the bot and the reason why its design is fatally flawed. Maybe you will find it as entertaining as I do.

I wish you all the very best in life.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most memorable moment of any pilot’s career is the first solo. For most, it is considered the crowning achievement of years of hard work, learning and dedication to our craft. It is a chance to push ourselves past our comfort zone for the first time. It is a chance to question whether we have the chops to complete something very few have even had the opportunity to attempt. Well, a few years back I had that very chance.

The day was uneventful, at least leading up to it. The sun was shining, a light wind out of the east and very little traffic at my local airport. After putting in about an hour of practice, my instructor pulled over. My hands sweating, he jumped out of the plane with a mere wink and wave. Even though I had prepared for this moment, I couldn’t stop the gnawing sense of nausea, stress and nervousness as I taxied away alone for the first time. Stopping short of Runway 16 at Chicago Executive, I went through my checklists (probably about six times to make sure I didn’t screw anything up). Fumbling, I clicked the mic to call up the tower:

“Tower, holding short of runway 16. Ready for takeoff”

Maybe, I should amend my previous statement. It isn’t the first solo (as a whole) that a pilot will always remember, it is the moment you leave the ground. This has nothing to do with joy, but everything to do with fear. It is at that point, that critical moment, where every pilot makes a choice. We make the choice to continue, to push forward past our fears and to embrace the unknown.

Let’s back up for a second – how did I even get here? High school was difficult for me, as it is or was for most of you all. I was sick a lot with various illnesses, a pretty big nerd (especially with aviation) and unsure in my own skin. Every day, I would rush home to lock myself in my room. Thing is? Once I got there, I was able to explore my own world. Reading about planes, airlines, and pilots was my escape. Flight sim and RC planes provided a respite from the bullying, and aggravation that a nerdy and “uncool” high school kid faced. I immersed myself in my passions, creating my own identity. Kids in school would make fun of me for it, while I grew deeper in love with this fascinating world. A world that, at the time, would give me so much more than I could possibly imagine.

Aviation helped give me a voice. It gave me a sense of belonging, a passion, a reason to get up and work hard. It gave me a set of values, and a determination to become a better version of myself. It may seem trivial to you, but it meant the world to me. Now, as a recent college graduate trying to find his place in the world. I can say with no embarrassment, no shame. I’m a nerd and I’m passionate about what I love. To me, there’s no better way to find yourself.

I have no actual idea about what I'm going to do and where I'm going to go from here. This letter to you, my dear friends on the LISTSERVE, is going to be less of a life-story but more of a meandering thread-of-thought where I try to get my thoughts straight (as straight as they can be, anyway) and just tell you about myself because hey, why not, right?

About where I'm going to go from here, currently, my desire is to go to university, but then again, I don't really know what I want to study. Maybe Landscaping Architecture? I was thinking of gene-technology, but then realized that I'm not good enough at math to get into that. We'll see about that!

A thing I've gotten very much into lately, though, is volunteering. It started with the Tallinn Old Town days, continued on with the Circus Tree festival, a festival celebrating modern circus, and now is going to continue on with a few more things during the autumn (two according to plan currently, but that might yet change), and hopefully the OTD & CT again next summer. I do hope I have time for them then, because working for money is rad, but there's something about the fun of volunteering & the company you have & the things you get to do that got me hooked on it.

Plus, free shirts. If they're well-designed, new shirts are always a very welcome thing.

But about what I want to do next year/what i want to do after high school/what I want to do with the rest of my life?

I have absolutely no clue, to be honest!

That's kinda what makes it fun, even though not knowing can get very stressful at times.

As for who I am...

That's always very strange to try and word about -- you could also say that I'm still figuring that out too, since you yourself are a constantly changing & growing as a person & change is a thing that's good not to be afraid of, although it can seem terrifying sometimes.

So, about me, here are some of my general likes -

I love Naomi Novik's ""Temeraire"" series, it has been my favourite book series for a few years now -- it's essentially the Napoleon Wars, but with some added dragons. I love it. I still haven't gotten to read Blood of Tyrants and can't wait until I actually get the chance to buy it. I even bought it as an e-book because I got some google money at some point, but then my phone screen broke and reading on my phone just wasn't that pleasant anymore. Oh well, in some ways I'm kinda excited to actually get the paper-version, especially since I have the rest of the (paperback) books sitting on my shelf.

A friend got me into the Percy Jackson books, and they're fairly good, too! The characters and plot are interesting and... tbh I kinda forgot that I still haven't finished the first book of the second PJ series (Heroes of Olympus) because I've just gotten... distracted. My attention-span works like that sometimes.

I also love Welcome to Night Vale, what a delightful podcast -- the other week I realized I've been a listening to it for at least 3 years now, and I think that's really cool.

I hope you have a good day,

Päikest,

September 2015,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/09/05/where-is-your-toothbrush/,"September 2015, 05",Where Is Your Toothbrush?,"Neither of us can remember how we came up with the idea to travel around the world for a year. We do know that the journey of making that dream come true required us to redefine home. “Identifying home is in essence an act of ongoing imagination,” writes Michael Dorris. “When we're home, we don't pine to be anywhere else, we don't feel out of place or a stranger.” We pined to be somewhere else very much.

Travel brought me, a Slovak, and her, an Californian, together in the Netherlands ten years prior; we decided home was anywhere we were together. As we watched our house sell, our budget tighten, and our belongings dwindle, tongues in cheek we also decided that the only object we absolutely needed on our travels, aside from clothes, money, and passports, was a toothbrush. And so we concluded: Home is where your toothbrush is.

Flipping Thoreau's exhortation to live at home like a traveler on its head, we set out to live in the world like at home. Wherever we went, we made a point of visiting temples, cemeteries, and markets. We ate street food and at restaurants, went to museums and corner shops, strolled the streets of villages and cities, hiked through forests and parks, rode public transportation. Everywhere could be home if we felt it was home.

Of course, it's not that simple. Sometimes I'd wake up and spend an eternity figuring out where I was. No wonder: in the 13 months of traveling I slept in 73 different beds. But because I am my only constant, wherever and whenever I was my habits and routines and rituals were always with me—they're what makes a place familiar and safe. Visiting the same kinds of places in every destination became a routine in and of itself. Repetition breeds familiarity, which, in turn, generates a sense of being at home.

Once you leave the original home, you make every home yourself. A location begins to feel like place and eventually like home when it acquires substance: the mass of memories. Where routines lay the foundation of home by creating a sense of regularity and comfort, memories build home up into a distinct place on your mental world map. Like every traveler I have a million stories from the road, which stitch together quilts of memories that I associate with each place. Those memories are the place. If an effect of travel is to create memories, you can be home anywhere, even on the road itself.

When place becomes a part of you, it turns into home. The distinction between where you live and who you are becomes blurred; if, as Robert Frost predicted, the day ever comes who you are, you may know better where you are. I felt I became one with many places: Bariloche, Havana, Penang, Sarajevo... We set out to live at home out in the world and in the process we discovered, nay, redefined ourselves, as individuals and as partners in life.

Home is also where your travels begin and end. We began our round-the-world trip in our adopted home town, Portland, Oregon. In the end we decided to go back to where we started—we realized Portland is home. We discovered, like T.S. Eliot before us, that “the end is where we start from.”

My toothbrush is in Portland, Oregon, where I advocate for a good cause, make beer, and write. Where is your toothbrush?

September 2015,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/09/04/ive-been-served/,"September 2015, 04",I've Been Served,"I would lie if I said I was ecstatic when I received the email informing me that I had won the Listserve. I’ve been part of the Listserve for a couple of years now and I knew that there was a good chance I would win one day. I was naïve enough to believe I could get away by just reading all of your interesting emails without ever having to write to you. I find it incredibly hard to write about myself. Maybe some of you can relate…

I could have easily ignored the “You Won the Listserve” email (trust me, I almost did) but I feel like I owe all of you. And, to be perfectly honest, there is a part of me that cannot wait to get to know some of you.

I also take this as an opportunity to take a break from writing my 15,000-word MA dissertation. It is Friday night and the deadline is on Tuesday at 4pm GMT and I am just about halfway done with it. It is worrying. On the one hand, I feel like this may be the first time in my life I will hand in an assignment late. On the other hand, I’ve always managed to hand in all my assignments on time and I don’t want my last assignment to ruin my supercalifragilisticexpialidocious streak.

It is typical of me to leave things to the last minute. It is the trait I hate most about me. At least I know why I do it, which is the first step to improvement. I “suffer” from a “condition” I refer to as writer’s paralysis. I have a tendency to get insecure about my writing and, on top of that, Perfectionism is my middle name. It is a lethal combination and I have tried quite a few things to do something about it. A looming deadline is still the most effective remedy for writer’s paralysis. At the same time, deadlines are also a leading cause for poor nutrition, sleep deprivation, panic attacks and occasional hair and nail loss. Do you have any drugs and/or magic remedies for my condition? Some good advice would be OK too… I guess.

I have recently started re-reading the Harry Potter series and even though I’m 25 now I still get ridiculously excited about it. I read for 1 or 2 hours before going to sleep every night. It’s one of the best parts of my day.(It comes right after waking up next to my boyfriend every day. Add something cheesy to your Listserve email = check. But it’s true). If you’ve seen the movies but never read the books, I urge you to read the series because you are missing out. They are really easy to read to and so entertaining! What is your favourite book/book series? I would love to know!

I think that is it from me and I’m also close to the word limit now. Feel free to contact me! Like I’ve already mentioned earlier, I would love to get to know you and hear your thoughts.

If you need advice about LDRs (Long-Distance Relationships), I am your woman. I’ve gone through it all.

I love you all!

My friends and I are storytellers all - so much so that we create origin stories for our Christmas trees and identities for our main courses (see Story 2). It's our way of remembering what's good, what's changed, and what's fun. I'm thankful for the story I get to live.

Story 1: Sky RatsThe day after my grandfather's memorial service, my mom, dad, and I went to my happy place: Santa Cruz, CA. We were sitting on a wharf, looking out over the ocean. The sky was incredibly clear, sea lions barked below us, and a surf competition was taking place a little ways off. We dug into our recently purchased colossal-sized box of taffy, peering out over the California-goodness. My dad uttered, ""Man, I could sit here all afternoon."" A deep, collective sigh of contentment. When, BLOOOOOPPPPPPP!!! A flock of seagulls sharted on all three of us. My dad and I looked at each other in shock, as my mom let out a wild laugh and yelped, ""Blessed by the sky rats!"" We all cracked up as I wiped bird poop off of my dad's head.

Story 2: Ethel Merman, Shia LeDuck, & Grace KellyWe named our first Christmas tree Ethel Merman. She was tall and gawky, her top branch scraping our ceiling, her branches creeping over the armrest of our couch. In the spirit of a woman clinging desperately to her gilded glory days, she dressed in far too much tinsel. She took photos with all of our guests, sang ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" with that jarring voice, and even had a boyfriend, Harry - a real boy! We escorted her to our snowy curb after having enough of her wild ways, but we weren't fully rid of her until October of the next year! Ethel, smh. At Thanksgiving, the duck we were cooking became ""Shia LaDuck,"" after watching Rob Cantor's genius Shia Labeouf video somewhere between 1 and 20 times. We posed LaDuck in his brining pot as if he were in a jacuzzi, little wings over the rim, sipping rum, brandishing a knife. The next Christmas, we had a classier tree - having learned from our mistakes with Ethel - named Grace Kelly. We adorned her with bright lights, blue and silver balls (all the jokes here), and silver bows. She had the prince - no mistle-toed trysts for Grace - and left without a mess. (A thousand thanks to Charlotte, Val, Brie, and Liane - my co-writers in these stories and many more.)

Story 3: A VoiceMy life has been pretty easy when compared to others. But everyone's got their stuff. I was abused as a kid by friends, dealt with anorexia and all the crap that comes with that, and had some serious co-dependency issues. In my last year of grad school, I was losing my mind trying to keep myself together. I took the day off - and still went to school, but not to class - and tried to get to the bottom of it all, when a voice spoke to me, ""Don't you know I will never use or abuse you?"" I began to weep - that's what I had needed to hear. I asked the voice who it was, and it replied, ""Jesus.""

I hope you enjoyed these. Have fun making and telling some of your own. We're all characters in someone's story. Whose are you in?

You may not have realised it at the time, but you have each taught me invaluable lessons that I will keep with me for many years to come.

When I was a child living in the Middle East, I remember throwing a tantrum one day in my parent’s car. I have no idea what it was about, but just remember that I was screaming and crying my head off.  A local Arab must have seen me from his car and motioned for my parents to stop. For a bit of background, being an immigrant in the Middle East, you sometimes get used to being a second class citizen, and so we were naturally a bit unsure of his intentions. He then handed me a brand new clock, still in the box. As I was just a child then, I don’t remember what he said to me, but I remember his kind words put me at ease and probably gave my parents some much needed quiet time. That clock still ticks at my parents’ house and constantly reminds me about cultural tolerance, random acts of kindness and just being a good human being when no one is watching.

After moving to Canada in the mid-90s, when I was in my early teens, I remember answering a newspaper ad to sell roses door-to-door out of a bucket. It was probably not the safest idea given the neighbourhood I was in, but I wanted to scrape together a few bucks to buy some roller blades. I tried my hardest for a few hours that morning without any luck. After being both physically and mentally drained, I decided to wait at the pickup zone accepting defeat. After about a half hour or so, a guy with a nice red convertible drove past and a few minutes later he drove back from the other direction, so I can only assume he saw me and pulled a U-turn. He then handed me a nice crisp $20 note, bought one rose for $3 dollars and told me to keep the change and to not give it to anyone. A $17 tip!! To this day I have no idea why he did that or who he was, but I hope that one day I can find him, shake his hand and say thank you. For now, this listserve will have to do. J I’d like to say I treasured that $20 till now and never spent it, but let’s be honest; I was a child with a $20 bill in my hand. I probably bought $20 worth of Oh Henry chocolate bars or 7 million gummy worms. Thank you red convertible driving stranger, not only for the kind monetary gesture, but for restoring my faith in humanity when I most need it.

The above two experiences have help mold me into the person I am today and I’d like to think I turned out alright. I don’t always have the money to give to charity, but I do make the time to volunteer and give back one way or the other. I hope that some of this resonates with you listervians and that you continue to be kind and help others because you may not know or realise just how big the ripple effect is that it has on people’s lives.

If you’d like to have a chat or share a story on what has moulded you, feel free to email me. I’m also always open to talking motorcycles!

The “lucky” part might be sarcasm. That is, being my age, in my out-of-work predicament, one would think the label would almost have to be used sarcastically.

See, my father used to call me “lucky,” and I never liked nor understood it. As I sit here today, I suppose I haven’t quite decided yet...but I’m open to possibility. Maybe getting my name called for the Listserve was luck by definition.

-Let me back up a bit to explain...

Just a few years ago I had a full-on career working in Corporate America. I’d been in my role for ten years, and was making pretty good money. I wasn’t passionate - at all - about what I was doing, but so what? Most people don’t like their jobs, right? I always just took it day-by-day; watching the clock until I could go home, watching the days until the weekend. Hey, at least I had a job “in this economy.”

Then began a bit of a “cycle.” Company layoffs.

The first time I was only out of work for about four months. The second time, it was well over a year. And while those days, weeks, months continue to add-up, you begin to question yourself -- a lot. Confidence sinks. You quickly learn that you have to find a way to fill that inner void somehow.

For me, my camera came to the rescue. While I’d never had the time to truly learn and practice with it, now suddenly all I had was time. And I had a beautiful city park - Forest Park, St. Louis - which I could walk to on foot. It forced me to be minimalistic. And it got me out of the house.

Soon, people began to tell me I was good at it. I just knew that I was feeling good *about* it, and that was the part I really needed.

A few months ago I once again found myself out of work. This time was very different as it was a rather bad situation, working under a vicious boss. Truthfully...it was a bit like escaping from an emotional prison.

Perhaps in the strangest form, it may have been luck.

Ironically, a friend had arranged a meeting for me that same week with a small local shop to see some of my photos. To my surprise, they were very enthusiastic and wanted to sell some of them as postcards and see where it went. The money wasn’t much at all, but it was the first time I realized (or believed) that my photos had value. For the first time, I didn’t feel like an “imposter” in the photography world.

I’m still struggling to find my way today. I’m considering Real Estate photography as a way to earn some actual money and stay afloat. It’s a scary time, but at least for the moment I’m not wishing my hours away anymore. And I’ve embraced valuing my days more than my annual income statement.

Maybe in the end I will realize I was “lucky” after all.

Maybe in the end, it’s all just relative.

They came in little conical packages. They were finger-length stick-shaped biscuits that came with melted chocolate to dip in. They were delicious. My personal method of eating was to eat only the tiniest bit of chocolate until there was only one stick left, then to use that stick to eat all the chocolate in one go. This was the time before you could get anything in Bangladesh like you can now; a time when a tasty imported product was cause for much excitement. They weren’t for everyone, of course. Nyam-nyams were for an elite upper class. Me. My parents moved my brother and I from the peaceful suburb of Tinton Falls, New Jersey, to the rural small town of Sylhet, Bangladesh, when I was six. The boxes of books and fruit roll ups and Disney VHS movies that were brought along to ease this traumatic transition didn’t last long. So I was a very pampered little girl. If there was an imported product that was new and exciting, particularly if it was food (getting me to eat was always a challenge), it was immediately mine. They were purchased in bulk at our house, stacks and stacks of them sitting in our kitchen. Nyam-nyams.            They went in my lunch box to school. Or tiffin box, as they were called there. I would get peanut butter sandwiches (creamy), carefully wrapped in imported saran wrap, an apple carefully sliced and peeled, and a Nyam-nyam. All placed in a fancy pink tiffin box that had a built-in spoon and fork section and a girl panda bear on the front.            The other kids would bring rice or cooked Maggi noodles with egg and onion. A solid piece of curried chicken if you were very lucky. Usually, and most unfortunately of all, you would end up with vegetables slathered onto a piece of bread. Vegetables overcooked in watery turmeric, in a box sitting in a hot classroom for half the day, the liquid seeping into the bread and turning it greasy yellow. Color and smell.            Arif was a boy in my grade. Vegetables slathered onto a piece of bread. He was one of the few boys in my grade who wasn’t mean to me all the time. He would help me open the plastic cover of the Nyam Nyam sometimes if it was particularly tight. On these occasions I would allow him to take one stick and dip it into the chocolate. I would hold the package as he did this. I winced when he dipped.            He never asked for more than one stick. And I never offered.

I'm a 22 year old millennial living in New York City working in the film industry. I know, I'm a cliché. Because of this I won't try to spout any knowledge or tell you how to live your life, I barely know how to live my own. 

What I really want to do is use this opportunity to make something great. Have you ever sat around and wondered what people on the other side of the world are doing at that exact moment? Well, me too. Especially around my favorite time of day, mid-morning. That great time after I've had my first cup of coffee and feel productive and creative and excited.

My proposition to you all is this: Let's make a short film, together. What I need from you is a ten second video (or up to a minute) of what you are doing at 11:21am. Maybe you're sitting at work trading stocks, or maybe you're playing with your pet cat named Rachel, or maybe you're just going to sleep because you work the night shift at a 24 hour diner. Whatever it is, I want to know. I will take all of your videos and make a collage so for that moment, we can all experience the togetherness that the Listserve cultivates. (If you've ever seen the movie, Life in a Day, that's where I got my inspiration, but instead of a day I thought I'd shoot for a moment).

To send me a video: either email it to me at my email address below or tweet it out with the hashtag #1121Listserve. I'll follow the hashtag so I can see all your videos and make them into a video collage and post it on my youtube channel, youtube[dot]com[slash]placesandthoughts. I'll also tweet it out under that hashtag so it's easy to find! If you film with an iPhone make sure to turn it sideways before you film!

I'm so glad to have this chance to speak with you all! Is there anyone else here who is much more comfortable speaking to strangers than to people they know they are going to get to know better? Well that's me, and I think I'll take this chance to share my secret nerdy passion for.. writing fancily.

Ever since I was a kid, I loved writing things. At first, I thought that the content of my writings was what I was so excited about. When I was 9 I think, I wrote a short story about an attention-seeking girl, illustrated it, stapled the pages into a little book, and gave it to my little brother for his birthday. (I'm sure he was thrilled.) I kept writing, but never really felt excited about the story. I just loved the action of forming the words and the part at the end where I got to beautify it. It felt kinda dumb, but I just couldn't put words to my interest in this.

I didn't give further thought to it until I spotted a fountain pen in a supermarket aisle at Carrefour (in Shanghai, not France!) a couple years ago. It was plastic, blue and green, and meant to teach little kids how to write. But I couldn't stop staring at that elegant fold of metal at the tip. That first pen pulled me into a wondrous world of fancy script, lettering, inks, and myriad other materials that could affect the effect of pen to paper. Who knew that so many people still loved the art of writing? I was surprised that there was even an art of writing. But with such a great community on forums and on Instagram, this hobby never fails to inspire me. 

What are your secret passions? Any tips on how to turn that passion into a full time reality? Would love to hear from you!

PS. What are the most delicious yet decently priced restaurants you have been to?

Cheers! Hazel

August 2015,26,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/08/26/the-river-of-no-return-wilderness/,"August 2015, 26",The River of No Return Wilderness,"In the spring of 2013, I spent my 23rd birthday in the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. I had just begun my second AmeriCorps term with the Montana Conservation Corps and it was the last day of our 2-week backcountry training hitch where we learned how to build and maintain trails, use crosscut saws and essentially survive 20 miles away from the nearest road. I remember waking up that morning to near-freezing temperatures with a pit in my stomach. I was turning 23 and I felt so behind. I got a degree in International Affairs and was immediately disillusioned with the industry; three years prior, I had come to terms with being a gay man and yet was too terrified to tell anyone or go on a date with a man; I had run thousands of miles away from my homophobic family knowing that I had barely any money and couldn't live independently for long. That morning I packed up my belongings and set out on the trek out of the Middle Fork. Keeping my eyes to the ground as anger and uncertainty clouded my head.

Over the following 9 months, The River of No Return wilderness brought me in and gave me a home. My crew and I hiked over a thousand miles that summer while rehabilitating numerous miles of trail destroyed by the million acre mustang complex fire. There were freak storm-cells that hung over the ridges and brought hail, flash floods, and snow (even in July!). There were sightings of bears, wolves, moose, and elk and run-ins with an interesting cast of characters who work, hunt, and/or live in the forest. I remember one particularly chilling moment when we heard over the forest service radio that a girl named Hannah Anderson had been abducted and taken into the wilderness by a homicidal maniac. We were far away from the sighting but I still slept with the radio nestled in the crook of my arm. Other than a frustrating government shutdown that  abruptly cut my season short, the summer and fall of 2013 has been the highlight of my young life so far.

The wilderness calmed me. It took away the anxiety and the fear. It gave me the strength to let go and the patience to let things happen on their own. Most importantly, it taught how to be happy even when I'm alone. That's important because even though I have incredible friends and a family that now loves me for me, there are still times where all I have is myself.

I now live in Washington DC where I work with Conservation Corps from all across the country. If you live in the area or want to tell me your wilderness/AmeriCorps stories, I'd love to hear from you! I also love board games so let me know your favorites.

Much love :)

I think email is more conducive to bathroom reading though. So here’s some scattered thoughts and quick takes for you to read in your “office""...

Our culture has become inextricably tied to images as a means of communication. You know the apps. Some say this has been a bad thing… selfies, emojis and memes carpet bomb societal intelligence and promote narcissism.

There’s a bright side though. Instagram provides a platform for photographers to display their work with appreciative folks around the world. Facebook keeps me in touch with my (ridiculous) parents across the country. Snapchat shows me what people are doing in places I’ve never been AND which of my friends are on the toilet.

A great photo can tell a story well beyond its frame. Who took it? What were/weren’t you wearing? Was a security guard about to tackle you? Who were you with? Were you in love or falling out of it?

Email me a favorite photo you’ve taken along with the story behind it.

Maybe I’ll make a cool page of your submissions! Or maybe I’ll just respond with unsolicited, unqualified artistic criticism?

Scattered thoughtsIf you’re too young/poor to invest substantial money (like me), learn how to invest time wisely.

Subtlety is an important storytelling device. Let the audience read between the lines every once in a while; you don’t have to spoon feed them everything. This goes for every form of art as well as lesser things like dating.

Tom Brady is lying about Deflategate and we all know it.

Presidential debates are incredibly bizarre. A bunch of white males covered in makeup delivering painstakingly rehearsed, focus-group-tested lines. In what other setting would this be normal? Don’t say my family reunion.

As far as media content goes, we drive the bus. As a recent Listserve post said, stop clicking on Justin Bieber and they’ll stop stuffing it down our throats wrapped in clickbait.

Never forget where you came from. I’ve lived in 4 U.S. states now and I admit I’ve changed to some extent in each to match my surroundings, but I always stick to my Ohio roots. Keep pulling for your home team (even if it’s the fucking Browns), don’t lose your accent, but maybe stop flying your ancestral battle flag if it’s offensive to a large group of people.

It’s funny to see how the media reacts to dating apps like Tinder. “The End of Chivalry!” “A Cheater’s Favorite App!” Unchivalrous guys are unchivalrous; it doesn’t take an app to bring that out of someone. Similarly, those who stray for greener pastures would have done it with or without an app. “Honey, I would’ve been faithful, but Nina was just 0.2 miles away and we had impeccable banter!”

I'm bad at english but i'm getting better.2 years ago I decided to really learn to speak english. It's not only about learning the basic rules of grammar like they teach in school. It's about writing, understanding and above all speaking english!I learn alone, that takes time. Fortunately, there are wonderful tools all around the Internet to learn new languages, for example Duolingo or Lyricstraining: i recommend these sites.Travelling also helps a lot. Go to a country where people speak the language you want to learn. The progress will be huge. With English, the choice is large because it's an universal language: i learned a lot in Spain, Greece, Ireland and the States these past months.

Then, you have to read, read, read. Articles, books and everything you come across.

An evolving process is any set of instructions that, when followed, produces slightly varied versions of that same set of instructions. 

Here's a very simple one: ""Please copy this sentence but with something changed."" 

Here's a child of that process: ""Please copy this sentence but with something altered."" 

Here's another: ""Please copy these two sentences. Please change something about them as you copy them."" 

They can become much larger and more complex of course and if you search for #evolproc you'll find some of the many shapes and styles I've experimented with. 

Do you know of any other projects that are similar? I'd love to discover that someone else has evolved processes before so I could draw some inspiration from their work. 

Would you like to help me explore? Evolving processes are very flexible of course and could relate to you in any way at all, so let me know if you'd like me to mutate a strain to include you somehow.

Austin has turned into a big city while I've been here.  I love it just as much as ever I suppose but it's not as comfortable as it used to be and its not quite as friendly.  I make my living computer programming and I'm also in a band which, frankly, makes me just like every other person in this town.  At least I'm a drummer and not a guitarist which separates me at least a little.Every summer for the last 15 years, I've gathered together with friends from my childhood in a tradition we call music camp.  Over the course of 4 or 5 days, we write, arrange, rehearse, perform and record as may songs as we can.  When we were younger, it was a very boozy time and the songs, while sometimes inspired, were usually sloppy and goofy.  We're a little more serious about it now and its a wonderful challenge.   There are few things in life more rewarding then creating and playing a song with old friends.  Each of us is so different now than we were back in Tennessee all those years ago but the core of who we are remains and our musical expression ties us directly back to our roots.

I'm overwhelmed sometimes by the sheer magnitude of all of life.  Every minute of every day humans are being born and others are dying.  Some are crying with pain they don't think they can endure while others are busting at the seams with joy too brilliant to believe.  All the while, the vast majority occupy emotional space somewhere in between.  I visualize it all as a never ending swirl spinning out impossibly complex patterns and fragments growing and collapsing and growing...  and here come these words now mingling with all the others.  and you've made it to the end of this little message if you haven't wandered off already.  well then hello.  and goodbye. ... and if you're ever in Austin, Texas check out the band Runaway Horse if we're playing out.  I'll be sitting behind the drums.

August 2015,17,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/08/17/find-the-others/,"August 2015, 17",Find The Others,"A year ago, out on the deep dark Playa, far away from the lights and music of Black Rock City, the LSD kicked in.

This week, the Perseids rained down silently from the heavens, but I sat inside on a Wednesday evening at a Consciousness Hacking meet-up in San Francisco.

Mikey the conference leader in his ""buddhistgeeks"" t-shirt says ""Consciousness Hacking is a hands-on approach toward creating new tools for self-exploration, in order to change the way we think, feel, and interact with the world around us."" In addition to using the 3,000-year-old technology of meditation, yoga, and certain plants and protists, how can we leverage modern computer technology and cutting-edge neuroscience to help everyone expand their consciousness?

Thirty plus years ago, I was a sci-fi reading, D&D-playing, science-loving, computer kid. Twenty five years ago, I got my EE degree and was doing UNIX system administration. I’ve seen computer games go from pong to photo-realistic Skyrim mods, disk storage increase 4.6 billion percent from 360 KB floppies to Samsung's new 16 TB SSD. I saw the birth of the web and its global conquest. I'd always wanted a real Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, and now it's in my pocket. This isn't ""rapid change"". I was at ground zero of a technological nuclear explosion.

This makes me very optimistic about our potential as humans on this planet. I've seen technological magic and miracles, and I've done my best to learn the spells and incantations myself.

One habit that I strongly recommend is to keep a journal. Not exactly a DIARY, just a notebook to jot down ideas, occurrences, and timestamps. I keep a small one in my pocket ALWAYS.

I had it with me that night on the Playa.

When the euphoric oneness with the Universe diminished and I remembered that I was a human being, I began to write.

In my altered state, I saw that we tell ourselves stories constantly. The biggest story is that you (or I) exist. Well, of course we EXIST, but we are a gestalt intelligence, made up of subcomponents and subsystems that ""VOTE"" on who we are and what we do. I saw the programming under the hood. As I took notes in my journal, jotting down questions, SOMEONE ELSE would answer. It was me (I think). But a smarter, better me. So I decided to listen as ""I"" wrote. I'm an atheist to this day. But I think I understand what some people mean when they say they saw God.

Since then, I've stopped drinking caffeine. I've started meditating. I feel that taking LSD is ""cheating"", but I want to find my way back to that conversation. Hopefully, my fellow Consciousness Hackers have insights and ideas to explore. Meditation is slow but steady, and I think it leads to the same place.

Here are a few lines from my notebook that night. I decided to listen to the voice, and my reality shifted.

""Seeking to understand your own consciousness is the only worthy goal.""""You are the same as everyone else, but not everyone seeks the truth. But you must train to find those who also seek. There is a real thing you are seeking. Be careful. Do not write UNTRUTHS. EVER.""""You have always been on this path""""Use the tools. Science. Writing. Notebooks. Take notes.""“Art is the brain looking at itself”""Explore your own consciousness. Seek to understand it through exploring an understanding of the Universe. They are opposite sides of the same vortex.""""Others have gone before. KEEP TRYING. Reach us.""

""Find the others.""

If you mentally squint, then it may be relevant to the rest of this email. Maybe.

Who is this:I’m an Egyptian who learned English while living in Japan. I’m currently living in Toronto, Canada after being kicked out of New York City.

I didn’t get kicked out for cool reasons - like running an underground dumpling operation, or something. It mostly had to do with paperwork, and timelines. However - getting “kicked out” has been the best thing to happen to me so far.

Introspection:I'm 25 years old. I’ve had a good life by definition. I have a family that loves me. I got to live in different countries. I got to be part of a failed startup. I am now with a successful startup. I’ve got a great group of friends (who I should be better to). And I have so many opportunities.

So why do I doubt myself? Why am I constantly fluctuating between thinking I’ve got everything figured out, and I’ve got nothing figured out? Purpose? Value? One of my best friends described this as just being in your 20s. I don’t know if it will stop - and to be honest I don’t know if I want it to stop. It’s tedious, it keeps me up at night - but It feels human.

Dealing with bad situations:I have a tendency to smile when I talk about bad things that have happened to me. I'm not sure why, but maybe this explains it:

I’m not owed anything. I was born naked into this world. When something ""bad"" happens to me - I don't think it's an inherently bad, or malicious thing. It is just a thing that has happened that has resulted in me being sad/upset. So the adversary that I'm fighting isn't this external cause which I have little-to-no control over. Instead it's about how I handle my emotions, and my response to this circumstance - which is completely within my control. I may not always get the result I want - but, hey, I wasn't owed it to begin with. :)

Questions: - People older than 25 - what’s one thing that you’ve come to learn that you would tell someone in their mid-20s that you don't think they'd know, but should just trust you on. Not that younger people don’t have any wisdom to impart - but I do believe some things are learned by time alone.

 - To everyone on the list: Where do you live? If you love it, why should I live there? If you hate it, why should I not live there?

Fun things:Favourite website ever: whosampled[dot]com. Discover music through samples, covers, and remixes.

I love getting glimpses into complete stranger’s lives (in a non-creepy way). Even if it’s the most mundane thing, I still find it interesting. If you’re on Instagram or Twitter, take a photo of something from your point-of-view with the hashtag #glimpsemoment, and maybe we can all get little glimpses into each other’s lives.

Shameful plug:Two hours before I got the email that I won Listserve, I was thinking about how I was going to get my side project in front of some eyeballs. This seems like the type of opportunity that I should not turn down from the universe. It's called Suto (asksuto[dot]com) and it helps you search for products you’re looking to buy - via text message. Check it out if you're looking to buy something!

Thank you for listening. I really do mean that.

Mike, Terry, Jenny and I spent every summer of our growing lives at grandma's house, overlooking a lake in rural Michigan. She was crazy and brilliant, and it was up to us to figure out the difference. She booted us out of the house any time it was sunny and we could wander wherever we wanted, as long as we stuck together.

""Don't bullshit yourself,"" my grandma would say to me when I was 9. I remember sitting in a dry tub, clothes on, while grandma lectured me for hours - not about having been caught playing with a lighter in the forest, but about being unable to admit it when caught. ""You can bullshit everyone else, even family, but don't lie to yourself, or you'll never know what is real and what isn't.""

I pouted and later my cousin and I boldly lied to each other about how we weren't doing anything. It was a seed well planted.

The first (of two) times I remember being slapped by my grandmother, rings and all, was in the middle of her yard - she was sitting on a stool, waiting, and beckoned me forward. Stealing my younger cousin's diary and gloating about reading it was, apparently, far worse than stealing grandma's quarters to buy candy. Her disappointment was a physical presence, and stung more than my reddened, shocked face.

She rode a classic hog style motorcycle and had a ham radio tower in her back yard. She swore frequently, but seeing's how she was from the poorest parts of New York City, it made sense that she ""didn't take any shit"".

She taught me morse code one summer, and for my final lesson, she had me say the result aloud: ""Your ass is grass and I'm the lawnmower."" She laughed this great booming laugh to the sky as I blushed, as if making her grandson say ""ass"" was the greatest comedy in the world. Yet you were always in on the joke - she made room for you to laugh at yourself.

She'd say ""How'd you get to be so smart?!"" with pride when I justified my behaviour on her terms. ""Don't take apart something you don't know how to put together!"" she'd shouted as I started anxiously at the ruins of her watch. ""How will I know unless I take it apart?""

She once asked 6-year-old me if I understood that she was gay, and then elaborated that she was attracted to women.  ""Duh!"" Climbing into bed in the early morning hours made it obvious that Carol was like a grandfather.

So was Lois, who lived upstairs. Lois and Carol pretty much despised each other and were never seen in the same room. How did grandma keep all that going? Her (pre-divorce) kids didn't love the arrangement, but to my cousins and I it was as unsurprising as an apple rolling down stairs. Grandma was a force of nature, with her cowboy boots and dangling 4-inch cigarette holder barely held in her lips.

She's gone (they're all gone), and I miss her. I didn't see her enough as an adult, but who ever does?

August 2015,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/08/13/trains-of-thought/,"August 2015, 13",Trains of Thought,"I’m constantly thinking.

I’ve had to slow down on numerous occasions so that my words can catch up with the speedy Trains of Thought darting throughout my brain.  These trains sometimes take detours allowing me to discover new ideas.  Other times, they unexpectedly break down and thoughts are left hanging.  This process is so intrinsic to my being since only I know what's happening.

So when people are daydreaming, I naturally want to know - what are they thinking?  It’s fascinating that every human, every brain has its own Train of Thought -  traveling at different speeds and overcoming different obstacles.

However - thoughts are just thoughts until an action is taken to change that. My friends inspire me to take my thoughts and do something about them.  They don’t allow a good idea to go wasted.  Together we are all so passionate; we can either be the most endearing people in the room of the most temperamental.

These are some of our Trains of Thought:

Beautiful, extraordinary people are everywhere you least expect to find them. And if you look closely enough and hear their story for its rusty, full-bodied truth then you too, become that. Because beauty is the perspective of the humble hearted, eager-to-learn/grow/feel, not something that you can see.A great man once said, “You can be imprisoned if you think of yourself as a noun.”We stand on their shoulders. They might be giants. Isaac Newton thoughts.How does a magnet lift a paper clip against the gravitational pull of the earth?

I know it’s hard to imagine Trains of Thought traveling from one end of the brain to the other, breaking down, getting repaired, changing speed, getting lost and taking detours. But that’s how it’s always been for me.

It's made things interesting.

At a party in high school, my friends dragged me out (again) even though I prefer to interact in small groups or not at all. I hid under a computer desk for the majority of the party. This was when I realized my behaviour was a bit odd.

I often go for a drink alone, just to think or watch hockey. (It’s the Canadian in me)

I have never felt that anyone understands or connects with me. No one has ever just “got” me. This causes me great anxiety. I did, however, meet an Uber driver in Chicago who seems to share this feeling with me, so virtual high five to him.

I used to smoke socially as a way to get away from the crowd. Until I realized that’s just plain stupid and conflicts with my healthy lifestyle/skincare regimen.

I used to live in Japan. In one sense, I was completely different from everyone and stood out. But in another, because I didn’t speak the language, I felt comfortably separate from everything.

The internet has allowed me to basically completely avoid any unnecessary interaction with other people. I can order pizza with an app. I can hail a cab without saying a word. That is awesome. I will do anything to avoid speaking to someone on the phone.

Please don’t ask me to go for lunch with you. It’s nothing against you. It’s just the only time in my workday I can escape.

If you have ever felt like this or this sits with you, worry not! I am a functioning person who I’m sure everyone thinks is an extrovert and very social. It just takes a lot of energy for me to be that way. I do however have some kick ass best friends and family who make my life incredible, thanks Kristen + Kate + Sam + Carley.

Some random things to round this out:Elon Musk is the man, I love wine (try Norman Hardie in Canada or Scribe in the USA), I’m working towards a world where women and men can thrive equally, and wear sunscreen damnit! (At least SPF 30.)

August 2015,11,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/08/11/re-visualizing-alaska/,"August 2015, 11",Re-Visualizing Alaska,"I was born on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. Six months later, I died.

I contracted Spinal Meningitis when I was six months old. I had a really high fever and eventually my body gave out. We lived in a logging camp called Coffman Cove in south east Alaska, only accessible by sea plane or boat. Another child brought the bug from the Seattle airport and didn't survive. I died on the emergency plane ride to Ketchikan, Alaska. The co-pilot grabbed me and resuscitated me.

Whenever people hear that I lived in Alaska they inevitably ask how I survived all the snow and cold. Alaska is HUGE, and isn't all ice and snow. South East Alaska doesn't get nearly as much snow as people think; it is actually a temperate rainforest. Ketchikan receives on average 137 inches of precipitation a year, over 11 feet.

That much rain makes the island of Prince of Wales one of the most beautiful places I have been.  The landscape and wildlife are unbelievable.  The only large mammals on the island are black bear and Sitka blacktail deer.  The Prince of Wales flying squirrel is found nowhere else.

I grew up in this wild landscape and I also moved a lot as a child. I ended up attending 13 schools, lived in 5 states and I don't know how many houses. Unfortunately I don't have any visuals from anywhere that I have lived. I can't tell you about my bedrooms, schools, teachers, or friends. I believe due to the high fever associated with spinal meningitis, when I close my eyes I can't visualize. I read somewhere that less than 1% of the population can't visualize. It is difficult to explain how this affects my life. But one of the biggest problems I deal with is people's faces and memories of locations. My memories aren't pictures in my mind. I can't see what my mother, spouse or child look like when I close my eyes. One way that I combat my visualization problems is to label everything in my mind. I use words to describe what everything looks like and I label it in my mind. This isn't a perfect solution but it does help.

Because of my word-oriented brain, I have always been fascinated with acquiring language. When I was young I read about feral children, children isolated from human contact. They have little or no experience of human care, behavior, or, of human language. Since that day I have wondered what happens if you do not have a language. Can you even think? Think about something-you are talking in your head. How would you do that without language? Would it just be images? What would happen with a brain like mine-empty of images and never having words to use?

I left the island and returned throughout my childhood- moving away for good in 1993 with little stored in my mind to remember the place. But my father lived on the island for most of his life. He was basically a hermit. He logged from when he was 18 years old and retired in his late fifties. My father passed away a few years ago and left my brother and I some cabins and land. We now rent them out. I went back to the island when he died to tie up the loose ends. I took tons of pictures. Now my collection of photos is my visual memory so I don't have to rely on my labels so much anymore.

August 2015,10,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/08/10/go-see-a-play/,"August 2015, 10",Go See a Play!,"Or a musical!  Or both!  I’m here to tell you all about the wonders of live theater.  There really is nothing else like it.  There is something about watching performers go through all the ups, downs, joys, sorrows, laughter, crying, etc. right in front of you that creates a unique connection between you as the audience and the performers onstage.  And that connection will always be unique to that particular audience because no two performances of a show are exactly alike.

Theater is a high-wire act.  There are no retakes or edits.  If you mess up, you have to keep going (which actually, as an actor who once broke down laughing hysterically in front of an audience after a lighting mishap, isn’t as damning as you might think.  The audience laughed with me, at least I hope it was with me, and it was all good).  And the excitement you can feel when someone (or you) belts out the perfect note or delivers an amazingly inspirational speech…well, it often leads to standing ovations.  Being in a show or in a theater audience on a particular night can make you feel part of something special – it’s a story you can share with everyone, but can only be fully understood by those who were actually there.

I consider myself a “theater person.”  There are many kinds of theater people, but what we all share is creative and inquisitive minds that are intrigued by the human condition and how different events can affect people.  The best plays and musicals don’t simply entertain; they make you think long after you’ve left the theater.

My high school theater director always extolled the power of theater, reminding us “there is a reason the medium has lasted over 400 years.”  I think part of it is that the best shows and performances live on so much longer than the original performance.  Plays and musicals, once introduced to the world, are intended to be performed again and again all over the world with different creative teams putting their own stamp on it.  Nothing is definitive about a show.  We are always reexamining how a character might be played or where a show could take place and so on.  When a show is brought back to Broadway for a new run, it is called a revival, allowing a new generation to experience it, likely in a very different way than previous ones, giving it new life.

If you’ve never been to the theater before, I urge you to go out and see a show.  It doesn’t have to be Broadway or the West End (though shows there are certainly excellent).  There are very likely multiple outstanding regional theaters near you to choose from.  A quick search on the Internet will show you where they are and what’s playing.  Find a show that seems interesting and go out and try it!  Many theaters also have discounted rush rates for tickets the day of the show, as well as discounts for young people, military members and more, so you can see it cheaply too!

Feel free to reach out if you want to talk theater or want any recommendations from me.  Also send me your theater recommendations too, I’d love to hear them!

Quick shout out to Bilaal for introducing me to The Listserve, anyone in DC should check out his product Linktank, a way of connecting people in the DC area to experts and events on topics they’re interested in in Washington D.C.

And to my amazing girlfriend, I love you very much!

Growing up with an abusive father and a dying mother my refuge was being naked in my bedroom. I could hide there, be naked and no one bothered me. I never knew there was a term for enjoying being naked. In 2006 an ad for Naked Bowling appeared in my email box in response to an ad I had responded a few years prior. I was nervous, but still went, in my neon purple wig. It was a Halloween, naked costume bowling. Naked bowling is to this day my favorite event. Being naked in a group, everyone is equal. Doctors, lawyers, fast food workers and the unemployed. There is a lot more honest conversation and most importantly eye contact and personal connections. Respect is the key. Nudists are the most respectful group.

Fast forward 9 years, 100+ events (bowling, tea tasting, dinners, potlucks, discussion groups, camping, casino night plus more) and I have served for the last 3 years as Secretary/Treasurer for Chicago's longest running group Chicago Area Naturist Sons. 25 years and no signs of ending. The group had rough patches, but people who cared stepped up, took over and made some tough choices that weren't always the most popular. We adjust to survive. In the early days the group survived fears of police raids by being a mailing list only via private invite and interviews to make sure members weren't police. As the dawning of the internet came, it left its days of Fold, Stuff and Lick parties to send out the mailing to an email list. Now in the age of social media we are moving away from an email list of close to 400 members to a new way to schedule meet ups. Adjusting and adapting is how any group will survive long term.

The other lifestyle choice I will share with you is about religion. I was raised, baptized and confirmed Catholic at St. Johns Catholic Church Goshen, IN. During my high school years I was highly involved at church. It was my chosen family. I taught catechism to 2nd and 7th graders. I was co-President of our youth group and I was up for a scholarship for Catholic Youth of the Year. One of my “friends” told my youth minister he had a concern that I was gay. I was pulled into a meeting with our youth pastor and was forced to go to confession, right then and there to confess any homosexual sin I may have committed, whether I had already confessed it or thought it was a sin to begin with. In college I was in Christian Campus Fellowship at Vincennes University. I was part of the worship team and outreach team. When I applied to be a resident of the house, I was told the board didn't feel it was a good idea to have an openly gay resident. Totally disregarding that I was Christian. I'm no longer part of any organized religion and due to these experiences question the existence of god.

If you are gay/bi/trans/queer/transitioning know that right now might not be the easiest. You will make it through this. If you need help or someone to talk to do not hesitate to reach out. I am here and there are great resources out there for you.

If you have questions or want to share a story with me please email me. I'd love to hear from you and plan to respond to anyone who responds.

tl;dr: he gets naked, isn't religious and wants to hear from you.

Then we plan to travel...but in the meantime we travel vicariously through our children's travels. Oldest girl is heading off in 8 days time to the north of Spain to 'walk the Camino', it's an 800km pilgrim trek, although she is doing it as a tourist not a pilgrim (atheist). We are so proud of her for giving this huge mental and physical trek a go and will be curious to see how this experience changes her, as I'm sure it will. I have recently seen a documentary film about this walk and know she will struggle but come out the other side a different person. She has travelled extensively and we watch on in awe as she takes herself to far flung places and does thing we couldn't have even dreamt of as young adults in the 80's.Youngest daughter decided a few years ago to become an exchange student, she ended up staying for 5 months in Michigan, I get the impression it wasn't quite what she expected however she stuck it out and met some lovely friends, saw more snow that she ever want's to see again, and got to be a cheerleader, something we just don't have here in Australia. We watch with pride to see how our girls grow, and we wait for our chance to travel too. Our wish list at present is -2016- outback Australia, Uluru, Darwin and Broome.2017- Germany, canal trip, and England, walking trip around Cotswolds villages.and then? ? New Zealand, Tasmania, Fiji, Burma, well really our 'world will be our oyster' as they say, what ever we can afford we will do!!!

August 2015,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/08/06/reconciliation-of-opposites/,"August 2015, 06",reconciliation of opposites,"I'm one of the older members of the Listserv. I'm 68. My mother lived to be 96 and I'm in better shape than she was at this age so I could make it to 100.   I retired from work in USA at the end of 2005 and have spent three years since then teaching English in out-of-the-way places in China. It's not really work unless you consider talking to students 12 hours a week to be work. And those are 50-minute hours.  

I have lived most of my life in the South.  Virginia and North Carolina. Many of my work-mates and friends have been and still are fundamentalist Christians. 6,000 year-old earth and all of that.  They knew that I did not share their belief but we have always been respectful.  Every day at work I ate lunch in the company cafeteria with a group of these friends. 

One day at lunch my friend Randy asked me outright what I thought happened to my soul after I died. I asked for some time to think about how to phrase my response and by the time I was ready the whole table was listening. 

I told him: I do not use the word ""soul"" very often but when I do I am referring to that part of me that experiences love ... and hatred, beauty ... and revulsion, hope ... and despair. 

They all nodded in agreement. 

But I also know that those are things that are happening within the little grey cells in my brain, little electro-chemical neurological interactions that I don't really understand. But I believe that when I die and my brain ceases to function, that my soul as I have described it ceases to experience those things and effectively no longer exists. 

They were less enthusiastic about this, but kept listening. 

Likewise, I do not use the word ""God"" very often, but when I do I am referring to that sense of connection that I feel, that we all feel, to all other living things, indeed to the earth itself. It is a connection that transcends time and space, which is why I can be moved reading about the death of Socrates over 2,000 years ago; why I care about how I leave the planet to generations that will not be born until long after I die; and why I am touched by an earthquake in Asia or a famine in Africa.  This sense of connection is real, it can move me to act, and it will continue to exist long after I die and as long as people continue to care about such things. 

Silence.  It is not their definition but it helps them to understand that I am a decent, caring person with reasonable beliefs. In one respect it feels as if I have cheated, I have come up with a new definition of God that removes the supernatural powers. But it brings us closer together and I get to keep the integrity of my beliefs. And I believe what I said.

Amir Hekmati was born in Arizona and raised in Michigan and is a first-generation American. In August of 2011 he took a trip that many Iranian-Americans take to visit relatives in Iran. It was his first trip to Iran and he took the trip to see his ailing grandmother who was too elderly to travel to the United States anymore. Two days before he was to return back home to the United States, intelligence agents took him and he has been imprisoned in Iran since. While imprisoned, he has suffered mistreatment, abuse, and torture. At one time, he was sentenced to death, only to have a higher court overturn the sentence citing insufficient evidence. In August, it will be four years since he was imprisoned, held because the politics between the US and Iran are what they are. It would be amazing if the new nuclear agreement was a step in the right direction to get this innocent man home to his family in Michigan. His father is currently suffering from brain cancer and has had two strokes. Time is not on their side.

Amir deserves to be known. He deserves to come home.

I am 32 and live in central MN. I'm married and have 2 girls who are growing up fast. I'm at that age where I'm realizing I am the adult of the world, and it's unsettling. We are the police, the lawyers, the doctors. People my age. And I feel like such a kid, a fraud.

I love my best friend, and feel like she should be celebrated the world over, just for being her. Shout out to Jenni. The world is brighter because of you!

You don't realize what pressure this is until it's your turn!

Email me if you want someone to chat with, feel the same unsettling feeling of being this age, have life advice, or just want to. I'm not the most fascinating letter, but I am authentic and kind.

Shout out to Mary Jane for keeping it that way. ;-)

August 2015,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/08/04/a-guy-in-a-cubicle/,"August 2015, 04",A guy in a cubicle,"The day I received my ""you've won!"" email from The Listserve, I was sitting in a hospital room with my father, in the last days of his life, checking emails on my phone to distract myself from counting his breaths. I started to write about what that was like, but I didn't even know yet at the time. It was surreal.

I tried again to write after he passed away on New Year's Day. But it was too soon, and those moments were too precious, and terrifying, to share with anyone else.

It's been seven months or so, and I made it through Father's Day with a few glasses of vodka, and today, his birthday, the day after the 46th anniversary of our first landing on the moon, I sat on the grass next to his grave and drank a couple of Budweisers. We're a Budweiser family.

​And now I sit, ​​​writing about him, listening to Sinatra at the Sands. I know all the words, even the talking parts. (If you want a window of understanding into the casual racism of the early 60’s, give his monologue on that album a listen.)

When I was born, in New York, my father worked for Grumman, on the lunar module. I was just a few weeks old when he woke me up and sat me on his knee in front of our tiny black-and-white console television​ to watch man's first steps in another world. This was one of many things about my father that made me proud, caused me to boast. But he would always slow my roll. I was just one of tens of thousands working on that project, he would say. Just a guy in a cubicle. I just worked on just one very small part.

But of course he was proud of himself for being a part of history. Would you like to guess how many times we visited the Lunar Module display at the Museum of Science and Industry? Or toured the Kennedy Space Center? Stood on the beach in Florida and watched a trail of fire into the night sky? Don’t bother. I’m sure you’re smart, but you can’t count that high.

Just a guy in a cubicle, he would say.

My father and I had some favorite things in common. The tail end of a hot day by the ocean, I would sit, unable to will myself to go up and inside, and he would appear by my side and hand me an icy cocktail and we would sit together, silent, watching and listening to the surf until someone called us up for dinner.

Other things. Lightning. Stories. Laughter.

Family. Friendship. Loyalty. The value of hard work. Expectations. Goals.

There are a few things that I learned from him that I didn’t understand until he was gone. Like, anger is nearly always just a side affect of fear and anxiety. And death can be accepted and rejected at the same time. And that he was proud of me.

The truth is that we are all just a guy in a cubicle. Whatever machine of which we are a cog, we are connected in unfathomable ways to parts of the world that we might never see. Every moment of kindness, of gratitude, of selflessness, of hard work, of anger, of hatred, of intolerance, of selfishness—these things will ripple, for a moment, for a thousand lifetimes, through a room or through the universe. We all know this.

Each one of us is just a guy in a cubicle. Sending a man to the moon.

Happy Birthday, Dad.

August 2015,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/08/03/whats-your-story/,"August 2015, 03",What's Your Story?,"A little more than two years ago, I co-founded a software company called Phone2Action with some amazing cofounders, Patrick and Ximena. We make digital advocacy tools that connect people with elected officials.

We are politically agnostic - nonpartisan - as a company. Our clients are a very diverse set of leading nonprofits and companies across the political spectrum. What they have in common is their belief in people, and how people can engage in the political process to shape their world.

It’s always gratifying to us when a client successfully mobilizes thousands or tens of thousands of advocates to stand up for something, and they win their issue. It shows the power that people have in our (American) democracy.

One of my favorite stories comes from a campaign led by one of our clients, the American Heart Association (AHA). The New York branch, and advocate across the state, had struggled for the past 15 years to get lawmakers in New York State to pass legislation that would provide CPR training for high school students.

Last year, they decided to change their strategy. Instead of focusing the New York campaign’s messaging on the large numbers of people affected by cardiac issues — like the hundreds of thousands of people that die each year to sudden cardiac arrest — they focused on the stories of a handful of courageous parents who had experienced painful personal losses of love ones to sudden cardiac arrest. They channeled these parents’ losses into strength by featuring their stories front and center on the campaign. The parents lent their stories, the photos of their children, and their voices to a campaign that instantly resonated with people.

AHA deployed several tools through our software platform and made it very easy for their advocates statewide to connect with lawmakers, and with the Governor, to voice support for policy change. Finally, after 15 years, the New York legislature passed the bill in last year’s session. Governor Cuomo later signed the bill.

Stories have a compelling effect on the brain; they draw people in, and they let them connect. According to Neuroscientist Uri Hasson, stories actually make two people’s brains synchronize.

I had a professor in business school, Craig Wortmann, who was an entrepreneur before he started teaching (would be) entrepreneurs. He wrote a book called “What’s Your Story” and encouraged everyone in the class to sit down and assemble their own stories in a story matrix. The idea is that you can draw on stories in different life situations and use them to connect with people, in both personal and professional situations. Having stories at the ready makes you a  more effective communicator. He demonstrated this every class, by drawing on stories to address different parts of his curriculum.

If you want to connect with me and share stories, you can email me back or Text LISTSERVE to 52886.

All the best,Jeb OryWashington, DC

Another father and son hiking pair told my dad “the trail was probably too steep for the girls (my sister and I) to hike.”  Yeah, guy, thanks, but we just finished that hike.The first time I was catcalled on the street I was 13.  I flipped the guy off, but was scolded because “I really should’ve been flattered.”The first time I was sexually assaulted I was 18.  I didn’t realize it was assault until three months ago when I came to understand that just because I was too drunk didn’t mean I was asking for it.The first time I was judged (by another girl) for not having sex with an interested party I was 19.The first time I learned not to take this **** was six months ago.

Hey, Listserve, cover your ears; I’m about to drop an F-bomb on you!  Feminist!  Yes, I am a feminist and I’m not afraid to use that word! Wow!

I realize that now is probably the best time for me to be a woman in the grand scheme of civilization (mind you, I live in the United States, so that statement is rather specific to this country).  I am not the property of my father or husband, I am not obliged to stay indoors unless my guardian gives formal consent, and pants are the best.  And that’s all awesome!

But there are still a whole lot of un-awesome things left.

First, now that we have so many more opportunities (which I’m eternally grateful for), we feel the pressure to take ALL OF THEM.  Not only do we need to continue our roles as wives and mothers, but we should also be running five separate companies while looking like a supermodel all without losing our cool.  That’s great if you’re into all that, but sometimes I just want to watch Netflix and eat cinnamon rolls for dinner like a normal person.

Then there’s the whole concept that we need to be super chill because any semblance of feelings in a potential relationship means that we’re nuts.  I spent way too many months letting an ex-boyfriend treat me poorly and feeling horrible about myself because I thought telling him that he shouldn’t wait two days to text me back meant that I was a clingy, psychotic girlfriend.  People, communicating your feelings to another human being does not make you crazy.  It makes you a rational person that has confidence in his/her thoughts and worth.

Oh, and heaven forbid anybody ever sees me with a tampon in my hand or pocket.  No, let me rephrase that – heaven forbid I even say the word tampon.  TAMPONTAMPONTAMPON.  This taboo irks me to no end. Sorry, this is a side effect of my ability to FURTHER THE HUMAN RACE and that makes society uncomfortable? (Sidenote: the expense of pads and tampons in the developing world is a real hindrance to the education of women and contributes to an increased incidence of HIV.  If you’re interested in that, check out WISER in Kenya).

I realize this was a rant more than anything else, but I hope I imparted some idea of the 20-year-old female college student’s condition unto you.  If you have any polite thoughts/comments, I really would love to chat with you.

PS.  Music recommendations: The Stranger by Lord Huron, Heavenly Father covered by Highasakite, Takk Sömuleiðis by Leif Vollebekk, and anything Taj Mahal.

PPS.  Any advice for an American trying to move to Scotland would be much appreciated.

August 2015,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/08/01/this-is-about-us/,"August 2015, 01",This is about us.,"I don’t identify as a sci-fi fanatic or with the technology-as-savior cults but I do thoroughly enjoy artistically deconstructing possible futures. I love to ask my comrades around campfires, on lunch breaks, while waiting in lines and dinner party spreads to describe a day in 2065. I probe about the prolific use of online dating influencing mate selection, solar roadways and self-driving cars eliminating traffic and parking lots, endless ""would you rather” scenarios and imagining all kinds of conversations with my grandkids that begin with “when I was your age …”

I want your thought experiments, your dreams, and different versions of reality. I want your obstacles and your most cherished moments; more than anything I want to awaken your childlike wonder and let our minds play jazz.

Here’s one of those ideas: can someone just please invent a better way to vote! And by vote I mean harness the power of big data to poll the public, educate voters at a point of relevant decision-making, match consumer behaviors with intentions, and basically disentangle politics to become a monthly exercise for the average voter to access timely, hyperlocal issues that matter most to the welfare of their community, and weigh their own roles and responsibilities? I dream of that ideal user interface, the functionality and accuracy we’d achieve, and our collective potential.

Speaking of collectivism, do you ever think about an end of the world scenario, where you’d need to design your tribe to survive? What is your role and which part would you lead? Who would you surround yourself with, and how would you determine compatibility? What are the basic skill-sets you’d need to cover amongst all of you?

If you apply all of these questions to your context today, what would you be doing, teaching, collecting? I’m interested in survivalism, but am more bent on educational reform and curriculum development. (More of these essential questions from Sir Ken Robinson’s book, The Element.)

As a designer of learning environments and tribalist myself, I think about these questions—mainly what will we need to teach the next generation? How will we engage one another? How will we express concerns, navigate uncertainty, and negotiate trust? What happens when there are no experts in the room? Or when we’re all experts? I worry how our conversations have changed, and with them, the depth and authenticity of our interactions. (Watch a slam poet explain how our decisiveness is dwindling. YouTube: “Taylor Mali- Totally Like Whatever, You Know.”)

Will you judge others because of their optimism?Will you patronize others because of their inexperience?Will you establish a hierarchy of wisdom because that is what was done to you?No matter your age, will you let yourself be seen in the name of learning? (See “The Daring Greatly Leadership Manifesto” by Brene Brown)

To face this fear to be wrong, the comparisons, the top-down rhetoric, the manipulative mindset of “should,” and your own crippling self-perception—we must realize our unshakable passions, thoughtfully talk about them, and invite others to explore with you. How can we co-mentor and develop meaningful, encouraging, symbiotic relationships from a place of humility and kindness?

So. Are you optimistic about the future? Do you let your wonder and curiosity run wild? Do you keep those that inspire you close? Are you asking questions that excite those around you?

Thank you to my dear friend Dan for forwarding a Listserve contribution about passion a few years ago and thinking of me. You’re a gem.

I never put any thought into what I would want to tell my fellow listservians if given the opportunity.  This is about to become very obvious to all of you.

Me:-          Native of San Diego.  I’m not sure if that means anything other than I love Tony Gwynn and deal poorly with both hot and cold weather.  And honestly, everyone should love Tony Gwynn.  Go Padres!  Go Gulls! (and, in a non San Diegan turn, Go Bruins!)

-          I love being barefoot, being in or around the ocean, good beer and/or whiskey, that moment on Saturday morning when I realize I don’t have to get up for work, indoor plumbing, the rare opportunity to be costumed and on stage, and lemons.

-          I have no artistic talents of my own, but think you should Google “Rudy McBacon” to see someone else’s.

Advice (no one wants it, but I must):-          Every now and then, do something foolish, slightly embarrassing, or at least somewhat impractical.   What is all up to you.  Easy examples from my history include, respectively,  jumping off of things a bit too high to jump off of, dancing in noticeably non-dancing venues, and working in haunted houses (which is completely exhausting, especially when you have a day job).  Also enjoyable is wearing silly headwear and trying to convince In-N-Out employee’s to sell you a raw beef patty.  Don’t do something that will seriously injure you or others; I said foolish not stupid and mean.

-          If you must sing karaoke, choose your song wisely.

-          Like different genres.  There is no law saying you cannot enjoy both Rob Zombie and Dean Martin.

When I won, I told my friend and listserve introducer Mary (go read her food blog – Google “This Tasty Life in San Diego”) who suggested I make horror movie recommendations.  I can think of nothing better, so here is an off-the-cuff list.  I tried to avoid the unbelievably obvious and chose to be liberal about the term “horror”:

-          Attack the Block-          The Burrowers-          A Comedy of Terrors-          The Devil’s Backbone-          Dog Soldiers-          From Beyond-          Housebound-          The Innkeepers-          Inside-          Intruder-          The Orphanage-          Pontypool-          Ravenous-          Session 9-          Trick ‘r Treat-          The Uninvited (1944)

Got some horror movie recommendations for me?  Non-horror?  How about music?  Books? Podcasts?  Maybe the meaning of life, preferably not as taught by a major religion?  I’d love to hear them – 

Prost!

I love music.I’ve been a musician since I was 12.I love writing.I’ve had a job as both a copywriter and contributing writer for over a year.I love photography.I take pictures on some kind of camera everyday.

But if you asked me what my passion is, I wouldn’t know where to begin.I spent a long time believing that I needed to discover my ‘passion' before I could meaningfully pursue something, frustrated by the feeling that I couldn’t discover a single, ‘true’ passion.

That’s because, unfortunately, I also love cliches like “find your passion.”An idea that I’ve been thinking and reading a lot about lately is pursuing your curiosities, rather than finding your passion. I’ve always found that the best way for me to find clarity and focus is to do, rather than to think.   Translating thoughts into tangible actions is the only way that I’ve been able to give myself a clear understanding about what excites me and what drags me down. About what I could see myself doing as a career, and what I could see myself quickly getting tired of.    This is how I’ve subconsciously lived for the last 22 years of my life and, until recently, I’ve always felt that I was doing something wrong. That I was aimlessly pursuing everything I was interested in, or curious about, instead of focusing on discovering a single ‘passion.'

Following a curiosity opens you to a world of experiences that consciously pursuing a passion doesn’t allow for.  

A favourite quote from an article I recently had the privilege of editing summarizes my thoughts perfectly: ""It’s only through doing that you get the clear signals you need for making next-step decisions."" -Gloria Eid

Validation is a beautiful thing.

I’m writing this on my 70th day of subscribing to The Listserve, and I’m thrilled to have an opportunity to share so soon. Thanks to Devin for showing me The Listserve, it may be the only thing I know that’s as eclectic as you are.

July 2015,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/07/29/stop-taking-time-off/,"July 2015, 29",Stop taking time off.,"“Taking time off.” I’ve heard this expression used many times to describe a choice of what to do with a period of one’s life other than graduate school or a highly competitive career-track job. It describes any number of things, from teaching to traveling, from research and working fellowships to a wide range of hourly-wage jobs. It’s used by our parents and our peers- heck I’ve even used the expression to describe my own decision to teach abroad. But I think it’s time we all stopped.

Justifying a choice of how to spend some period of your life as “taking time off” does a disservice to you and to the work that you’re doing. Framing your decision to teach abroad or with a domestic fellowship, or pursue an Americorps fellowship, for example, as “taking a couple of years off to _____” devalues the profession and the community in which you will be working, as well as your own potential contributions. Justifying a decision to live at home and invest in your relationships with friends, family, or significant others as “taking a break” trivializes the value that these relationships bring to your life. Explaining a decision to travel the world as “taking some time off” cheapens the incredible contribution that travel and exploration lend to personal growth and development, as well as the joy and utility that the experience itself provides.

The rhetorical structure of “time off to _____” implies that the activity or experiences filling in that blank are somehow separate from the “real world” or from a person’s “real life”. In actuality there is no “taking time off” from life- there’s only living it. Many of the experiences we qualify and justify with the expression“taking time off” are among the most formidable and important of our lives. They will impact your relationships, self-identity and yes, even your career, for years to come- in both tangible and intangible ways.

We make important decisions on how to spend portions of our lives for all sorts of reasons. Some are professional, some are personal, and some are simply because it’s what we wanted to do. Sometimes the path is linear, and sometimes it takes longer to see the full importance of an experience. But none of this means that the time we spend growing our relationships, our horizons, and ourselves has to be explained as “time off.” Just because a decision doesn’t fit into a common social narrative of what you should do doesn’t mean that it isn’t a valuable experience in your life.

So pursue the fellowship. Teach. Live at home and work at that coffee shop. Travel. Invest significant time in your relationships. Do all of these things or none of these things…but let’s just please stop “taking time off” to do them.

To keep this very simple, I figured I'd ask for three things and offer up three things.

I'm a 22-year-old startup founder based in South Florida, currently on a leave of absence from the University of Pennsylvania working on building the company full-time.

The company is called Klink — we have an app and website that let customers order beer, wine, and spirits for delivery on-demand in under an hour.  We're creating the best way to buy alcohol. 

What I'm Offering:

1) Being an entrepreneur is sometimes very, very hard — way more difficult than anyone tells you. The wins are, of course, equally as exhilarating, but the lows are hard to bear. If I can help at all, even just as a sounding board, email me.

2) If you're visiting South Florida (particularly Miami) and need awesome recommendations, email me.

3) If there's something small I can do that will take 3 minutes or less of my time that would help you reach success, email me.

What I'm Asking:

1) I'm crazy about travel, and I want to know more about all the small, off-the-beaten path, beautiful places the world has to offer (and the big, popular ones too). If you live somewhere beautiful, interesting, or captivating, email me a super short blurb telling me why I should travel there.

2)  If you know anyone in the Miami area who is an all-out hustler, business-minded, and could run local marketing for our company, we want to give them a shot; email me.

3) If you know anyone doing interesting work in the alcoholic beverages space, I promise I can find a way to make their day/week/month/quarter much better; email me.

Thanks so much! I'll leave you with a quote from Marcus Aurelius: ""The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.""

no advice mail today, just another story-about-my-life by a 25 year old - please be indulgent :)

One thing I discovered lately was meeting different people. Growing up in a small city, I used to stay with the same friends for years. Because of my studies, I went to increasingly large cities, but still met people in the same fields or having the same interest. Friendship was an important part of my comfort zone. I felt more and more trapped in my world, seeing people with the same background, the same interests, the same view, the same goal in life.One day, I finally decided to stop. I went on holiday, broke up with my boyfriend, moved to another place and started a new job. I had the opportunity to work in an environment with people from different cultures, having done diverse things in their life and seeing the world differently. I also started volunteering for several associations, discovering a new life in a city I thought I knew well. I've since then met various people, some deeply engaged in changing the world however they can, others with a unique point of view on topics I never really thought about in depth. I discovered new lifestyles, out of my comfort zone, which made me reconsider the choices I've made so far. They helped me to reflect on the life I want to live and the values I want to defend. They taught me to respect people and their opinions, and how to communicate better. I owe them  so much I don't have the words to thank them enough for what they gave me.Now, one of the consequences of all these meetings is my future move to Australia next year. I'm still struggling to choose where I'll live or what I'll do - any hints for what I should absolutely see or do while there? I also hope to find people involved in fighting food waste or improve the world in their way!

To finish, a little bit of musical chauvinism, a list of some of my favorite French bands or singers, more or less well-known:Woodkid, Jil Is Lucky, Cats on Trees, Christine and the Queens, Skip the Use, Mickey 3D, Indochine, Barbara Carlotti, Boulevard des Airs,  Elephanz ...Please send me your musical suggestions, I'd love to hear other kinds of music, or typical songs!

PS: a special Hi! to all the Discosoup friends and people from the Greeters Network all around the world! Both associations are doing amazing stuff to respectively fight against food waste in a funky atmosphere and create links between locals and tourists. Check them out if you're interested!

I thought of many things that both describe me and could be interesting to some of you and I came up with this.

I am Russian, I live in Russia and I traveled a lot.I’ve been to Europe, Asia and some other places. I’ve never been to US or Australia so far, but I’m only 30. I could eventually land there, too. At least I prefer to think this way.

I am bookworm and writer.When I get to another country, I need to dive into local life to understand how people live. I google blogs and search local books in English, I speak and sometimes ask too many questions. It was easy in India where people blog, think and speak in English (also I miss masala dosas so let’s cut it out). It’s not so easy to get honest and understandable reply in English in my country. Let’s break the ice!

For the last three years I’ve picked and written non-stereotypical stories and facts about Russia.You can google «tipsfromonerussianbear».I think I’ve run out of ideas today.

So I will answer every curious question about Russia or Russians and post on the blog.Except heavy political or religious issues for these are really not my areas.

Maybe you’d like to know if Russians really eat caviar?Are there still many Lenin statues in our cities?Why is unused iron always being kept on the windowsill?Do babushkas use e-book readers?What Russian music could be nice and moving?Have I seen a single person eating peanut butter sandwich?I’ve answered these already on the blog.

If you always had specific question in mind but had no Russian friend to address it, go ahead. I’ll try my best.

And if you'd rather watch my instagram feed instead, search for @forgetenot.

Hugs to @shamakai and Erika! You are amazing.Also I have to say there’ve been some Listserve winners who answered my reply. It was heart-warming.

Thanks for reading, y'all!

July 2015,23,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/07/23/heart-of-the-matter/,"July 2015, 23",Heart of the Matter,"When I was 6, my mom and dad got a divorce and my mom moved to NY. My sister remembers standing on our driveway in Florida waving goodbye as she drove away in her white station wagon. As a young girl, I didn’t quite understand where she was going and why. They say your subconscious belief patterns are formed by the age of 6. These are the beliefs responsible for the way a person thinks and behaves, basically lives their lives, and can affect relationships, career, finances and more. When my mom moved away, I downloaded the belief “I am not worthy of being loved.” If my mother can’t even stay with me, who ever will? Since then, anytime anyone gets close to me, I repel. I retreat. I run. I run for a safe place where no one can ever leave me again, and subsequently, that’s left me harboring quite a bit of sadness.Growing up my older sister and I played, all day, every day. We used our imaginations to escape the grief we had internalized. We became best friends and did everything together. Over time, we drifted apart. She grew disgruntled and angry and took a lot of her pain out on me. I understand now, but at the time, I didn’t. I just thought I was worthy of punishment, like it was my fault all this had happened. It wasn’t until recently I started to put my story together, and understand, how early childhood events affect us, even well into our adulthood years. I found ACoA- Adult Children of Alcoholics- a program, like AA, for anyone who has experienced family dysfunction intending to teach you to become your own loving parent.We all carry these voices inside our head: “you can’t do that,” “you aren’t ready” “no one will care about your story,” “you can’t quit your job and pursue your dreams.” All of which prevent us from living the lives we yearn for. It’s interesting to tune into these thoughts and ask, is this me or my mom or dad or sister or crazy uncle speaking? Likely, if the voice is negative, it isn’t your own. It’s coming from someone else who at some point said you weren’t good enough or that skirt is ugly, and now you fear fully expressing yourself or doing something you really want to do. The good thing is we are all equipped with the tools to change. It just takes patience and practice and most importantly forgiveness. We need to forgive ourselves for all we didn’t do or did do that wasn’t aligned with our own best interests. We need to forgive others knowing also they were just trying to do the best they could carrying whatever pain they had at that time. Don Henley had it right. The heart of the matter is forgiveness. In order to move forward in life, we must forgive ourselves for the burden of the past (or present) and out of love, give ourselves the opportunity to live a life we desire, not what others desire for us, but what we want for ourselves.I’d be happy to hear from anybody about your own stories of the past or present and how you’ve healed and grown or have yet to do so. Perhaps, we could help each other heal together.

July 2015,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/07/22/e6-e7-and-hpv-oh-my/,"July 2015, 22","E6, E7, and HPV, oh my!","Some women may have noticed that in the past 2 years, their primary doctors or GYNs no longer check pap smear annually. Why not? To answer that question, we must understand 1) what is a pap smear and 2) the natural history of cervical cancer. During a pap smear, a sample of cervical cells are picked up with a small brush or ""spatula"". These cells are sent to the pathologist who stains them with certain dyes which allow visualization of the cells via the microscope. (The images are actually quite beaufiul - do a image search for ""pap smear histology"".) Based on certain features of the cells, the pathologist decides whether the cells are normal or abnormal. If abnormal, the pathologist decides on exactly how abnormal - from cells of ""uncertain significance"" to cancerous cells.  Thus, one of the goals of pap smears is to detect pre-cancerous cells and early stage cervical cancer. The development of cervical cancer is a stepwise progression from pre-cancerous lesions (CIN 1 --> CIN 2 --> CIN 3) to invasive cancer. This process usually takes many years. Like all cancer, it starts with one cell that had mutated enough to allow it 1) to escape death and 2) to grow unrestricted. How did this cervcal cell get mutated? Epidemiology research have shown that almost all patients with cervical cancer also test positive to HPV (human papillomavirus). The most common types of HPV are labelled ""high risk"" types. HPV 16 accounts for 55-60% of the cases. The second runner up is HPV 18 which accounts for 10-15%. The current theory is that HPV infects cervical cells and can produce oncoproteins which can suppress the cell's own proteins that are responsible for regulating cell growth. Not everyone who has HPV will develop cervical cancer or even pre-cancerous cells. In fact, 90% of HPV infections resolve because our immune system can fight off the HPV infection. This is why sometimes patients can have abnormal cells on pap smears that will no longer be present with the next pap smear. Persistent HPV infection is worrisome for high grade pre-cancerous lesions that have higher risks of developing into cervical cancer.  Given the close association of HPV with cervical cancer, testing patients for HPV infection along with pap smears can better predict who is at higher risk of developing cervical cancer. Given that most HPV infections are transient and that cervical cancer takes years to develop, the American Society of Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology has recommended that women should not be screened annually with pap smear. Guidelines now recommend screening intervals that change based the patient's age as well as prior pap smear and HPV results. I hope you found that interesting and enlightening! I am an OB/GYN who firmly believes in the power of patient education and medical literacy. If you are a scientist and/or dreamer, I would like your help to change the way we perform surgery. For hundreds of years, surgery is performed with the scalpel (in its many permutations). Wouldn't it be amazing if we could develop a targeted cellular or molecular based approach where the patient ingests or is injected with a compound that digests whatever tissue (gallbladder, uterus, cancer, etc) that needs to be removed? That would be the ultimate ""non-invasive"" surgery! Live long and prosper,Chensi

July 2015,21,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/07/21/occupational-therapy-enables-what-is-it/,"July 2015, 21",Occupational Therapy Enables - What is it?,"What is Occupational Therapy (OT) and what do Occupational Therapists (OTs) do? This is often a very foreign or confusing pairing of words. The word occupation sparks connections to work and employment. As a current student occupational therapist studying in Canada, I want to share with you my passion and explain a little about what makes this profession unique. A comparison I make is family doctors are the generalists in medicine whereas OTs are the generalists of rehabilitation.

OTs are an allied health professional using an evidence based framework to guide rehabilitation interventions. OTs help people get back to their meaningful daily activities, activities that often give us a sense of identity and purpose. OTs work with a variety of individuals from infants, children, adolescents, adults, to older adults. They use a holistic perspective analyzing the match between the person, environment, and occupation - from this, they can provide recommendations to maximize functional ability.

They can be seen working with individuals having challenges with personal care (e.g. dressing, feeding, bathing), productivity (e.g. engage in play during childhood, participate in school activities, able to perform tasks at work), and leisure (e.g. fabricating a customized hand orthotic to enable piano playing after degenerative changes from arthritis). OTs can be seen working in a plethora of settings from school systems, intensive care units, hand therapy, falls prevention, low vision technology services, addictions, mental health, ergonomics or consulting- just to name a few! During my previous placements/internships, I had the privilege to help individuals transition home from the hospital after extensive physical injuries and help reintegrate individuals living with mental illness back into their community. I also worked with individuals adapting to physical changes and challenges after stroke, such as troubleshoot how to eat using adaptive utensils or put on a shirt when one arm is paralyzed.

It truly is an amazing profession to be a part of especially when individuals express ""I can write again... I can feed myself ... I can take a shower independently... I feel confident to return to school... I have more strength and coordination now...""

I truly love my profession. I love how I can help enable all sorts of occupations. I love the breadth of areas I could work in. I love how I can be creative coming up with client-centerd solutions. I love this uniqueness of occupational therapy.

To finish off, I want to leave you with a quote: Occupational therapy practitioners ask, ""what matters to you"" not, ""what's the matter with you?"" -- President of the American Occupational Therapy Association

I hope I did justice to describing the OT profession. I would love to hear from you if you have any questions, are aspiring to be an OT or is an OT colleague! I can be reached at

They are little human shaped balls of energy that can go from happy to enraged in 20 seconds flat.  I should know because I have 2 of them, both girls.  One of them is named Sydney (age 10) & the other is Annabella (age 7).  They are both insane... of course, it takes one to know one.

Once I watched a PBS show on how they made cheese.  To my naive eyes, it appeared like they were putting water into a large vat & stirring it continuously.  Later that evening, while I was taking a bath, I thought it would be a fantastic idea to try to make cheese by swirling the water around in the bathtub.  I pretty much succeeded in making a large mess, but no cheese, which was disappointing.

When I was a teenager, my mom would tell me to do certain things around the house before she got home like emptying the dishwasher or dusting the living room.  Occasionally I would be asked to vacuum the main level of the house.  The carpet is pretty thick.  I figured out that if you ran the vacuum over the floor (not plugged in), it would show the same pattern on the carpet that it would if you really vacuumed.  So I would get lazy &  just move the vacuum around the room before she got home.  It wasn’t until later in life that I realized it took the same amount of energy to do it the “lazy” way or the right way.

Now a word from my crazy kids:

Sydney - ""Kevin doesn't like thunder storms.""

Annabella - ""Riley doesn't like tomatoes.""

Sydney - ""What does that have to do with what we were talking about? Tomatoes do not fall from the sky nor are they thunder or lightning.""

Me - ""If I have it, I don’t share it. If I share it, I don’t have it. What is it?""

Sydney - ""Ebola.”

""Ooooo.... I got a butt whisper. Never mind, it escaped."" - Sydney

Sydney - ""It says in this book that she holds up a cussing finger at someone. What does that mean?""

Me - ""A what?""

Sydney - ""A cussing finger...""

Me - ""Oh... Accusing finger.”

Sydney - ""Is the Loch Ness monster real?""

Annabella - ""No! Scotland is an old place full of make believe things.”

Annabella - ""I wish we could have a cat.""

Me - ""Yeah, if only my eyes didn't water and itch every time I touch a cat.""

Sydney - ""I think I am allergic to sisters because my face is itchy right now.”

Annabella - ""Were you alive in the 90's?""

Me - ""Yes...""

Annabella - ""You got to see black and white!”

Sydney - ""Why would Dumbledore play golf?""

Annabella - ""Because he's old.”

""Curse myself for making my Pokemon too strong."" - Sydney

Some quick facts about me:

I play World of Warcraft (Horde-Tanaris, battle tag MaraJade#1539).The Dresden Files rocks my face off.I make geeky earrings & sell them on Etsy.My top 3 favorite movies are The Princess Bride, Monty Python & the Holy Grail, & Jaws 3.When I listen to 80’s music, it makes me homesick because my mom listens to it most of the time.Love Star Wars.One of my very good friends, Joe, is a librarian.  I love to read.  Thank a librarian the next time you see one.

1) I am a 21-year-old student studying engineering. I move every four months because of my co-op stream, which makes life pass by extraordinarily quickly. Imagine just as you're getting used to a place, having to leave it. For someone that is more introverted, I find this very hard. Especially when it comes to making friends. 

2) I suck at responding to people. I'm the person that gets back to you a week later. I don't know how to stop it as I think I would have closer friends if I kept up with them more when we're away from each other. I leave sticky notes and random text messages to myself to try and remind myself to get back to people, but I just don't. Maybe it's because I'm not always sure what to say back or maybe I'm selfish and content with the information I have and feel no need to share further. I hope it's not the second. Sometimes I think thats it's all the platforms that are ""required"". Maybe if I picked one it would be easier. But I love having the opportunity to catch glimpses into other peoples lives (that facebook etc provides) too much to delete it. 

3) I struggle with working hard at school. I don't necessarily feel like I have a goal right now that I'm striving towards. Grad school? A job? What kind of job? I like everything I've done on co-op so it doesn't make it much easier. 

4) When I'm in a good mood my self-esteem can be quite high. I feel like the cards that were dealt to me in life were pretty fantastic as I'm capable of a lot of different things, often conflicting with stereotypes and assumptions that people have about me (aka I'd consider myself a girly girl, but I'm in engineering which is typically considered a more male career path). I actually really like this about myself and I like to think that it it helps me to withhold judgement from other people until I know them better. 

5) This being about to do a lot of things is also the bane of my existence as it adds to my indecisiveness, which is already quite high. I have done so many different things in terms of sports or other activities and I wouldn't say I am great at any of them, but capable in all. Jack of all trades types of things. Thats exactly what my degree is too as I pretty much sample all of the engineering disciplines plus get some really cool electives. 

6) I'm moving to San Francisco (bay area) soon! If anyone is in that area would you mind messaging me with things you think I should really do while I'm down there? Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge are like my two things right now other than just wandering around SF. 

7) I'm terrified of waking up one day and not having made enough memories. I try to keep a journal, but haven't been able to do so consistently since grade 3, when it was all trivial stuff and silly crushes on boys. I also try to say yes when people ask me to do things (only when it's safe and I'm moderately comfortable! No surprise tattoos) to allow for events to happen that would cultivate those memories. I have a few good ones.

That's all! :)- Aryn

To be precise I was at the Globe watching As you like it. The reason it is no surprise to me that I was at the theatre when I received  this email is because theatre is such an important part of my life…….it  is where I go to escape, to lose myself in another world. I will tell you a little secret though; when I was younger I hated the theatre with a passion. The first show my parents took me to see was Starlight Express, I cried all the way through it from start to finish! Now my life revolves around it, I don’t think my parents could ever have imagined that! Here in London we have some of the best theatre in the world so here are my top three recommendations if you are heading to London in the not so distant future. Matilda because the cast of young children are just amazing, The Play that Goes Wrong because I promise you, you won’t stop laughing and Wickedbecause the song ‘Defying Gravity’ just gets into your soul. I am 26 years old and I write this email when I am in, what I would describe as a ‘crossroads’ in my life especially when it comes to my career. I currently work as an Agent’s Assistant at a talent agency for children and young performers in London. Last summer I even got to manage the entire agency whilst my manager took a three month sabbatical. I love my job, I love the families that I work with and am so happy to have found a job that I am so passionate about but now after three and a half years at my current job I feel ready to tackle a new challenge. My main aim is to work in an agency with high profile clients. As my job is all about networking I felt that I could not miss this opportunity when writing to so many people around the world to ask for some help. If you have any connections in the agency world I would love to hear from you, to ask advice about my next step and how to move forward with my career.  If there are any theatre lovers out there, I would love to know what your favourite theatre experience has ever been? What plays would you recommend reading? I am also heading to the Edinburgh Fringe so any recommendations of shows to see would be much appreciated! A little quote that I always try and keep in my thoughts ‘Go confidently in the direction of your dreams!

and so there must be some mystical reason that I did and you are reading this. So venture on and spend just a few minutes of your day entertaining my message and let’s learn a thing or two from each other. I am a second grade writing teacher (one of the many current definitions I have for myself).If you have a child in school, you know that education is not like it was when we were kids. There are fewer recesses and arts and crafts, and teachers aren’t geriatrics wearing jean jumpers with ugly Sketcher shoes, and that’s just the beginning of it. Education has evolved in to a data-driven, high-stakes test-taking, intense beast of an industry. Of course, I’m only speaking from my perspective. I teach at a charter school. But let me tell you (I assume you as being an educated, driven human who wants to learn from others. Why else are you getting extra emails clogging your inbox?), I really love it. I’m passionate about it in a way that only a person whose immigrant mother with an 8th grade education who works in a factory so that I could go to college can be. I’m passionate in a way that I see myself in my second graders – full of hope and optimism (way more than I actually have for the world).   So every day I tell my kids several things: -I don’t have to be here. I don’t. I could get another job and make more money. But I woke up this morning and chose to be here with you today. I’m grateful to be here with you, and I want to be here because we learn from each other, and I love you.-I don’t have all the answers (if any). I know that the more I love and encourage others, the better I feel inside. I know that sometimes I can work really hard, and it still doesn’t work out. I know that life goes on and on and on. I know that emotions come and go.-You don’t have to go to college. But if you’re not going to go to college you better be really damn (jk I don’t say that) good at whatever you do, and you better be creative! So, I’m preparing you for college, because I’m helping you be your best. But I really just want you to have the choice to do whatever makes you fulfilled and grateful to be alive.***Disclaimer – I am not Mother Teresa. I get paid for my job, and sometimes it’s a grind. I tell my kids when I’m tired too :) such is life. It’s summer, and I’m getting ready for the new school year, so email me back and let me know: What am I missing? What else should I tell my kids? What do you wish someone would’ve told your second-grade self?  If you’ve read this far, I might as well continue –Books I’d recommend:Shantaram – Gregory David RobertsA New Earth – Eckhart TolleA Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius – Dave Eggers (shout out to University of Illinois!)The Goldfinch – Donna TarttThe Art of Happiness – Dalai Lama XIV(send me book recommendations too please!) Shout out to Mohamad for introducing me to the Listserve! Elizabeth ShaferIG: e_shafHouston, TX "

So I lived the life of someone else. My non-self protected me from what I feared the most, judgment and rejection, so I blindly let it rule my life. My non-self ignored my heart’s desires and pleasing others became more important. My non-self kept me from living my life’s true purpose and it kept me from singing my song uniquely, as only I can. I write to you as someone who's spent the majority of my life being afraid to embrace my life's calling; for me, that calling has always been to write and perform music. Music that shines a light on some of the inequalities still present in our world today. Now you may wonder what finally triggered me to leave my non-self behind. Well, let me tell you.  My journey to adulthood began 10 years ago when I packed two suitcases and moved from Sweden to the U.S. for college. What I didn’t know then was that this was the first of many decisions that I would end up making, or rather, that my non-self would make for me out of fear. I had always been a top student, ambitious throughout high school, so I saw a college education as the obvious next step. But my dream since I was a child was to sing and write music.  Growing up my parents always supported my desire to pursue music but it was encouraged only as a hobby. My parents placed tremendous weight on the importance of education because they feared that if I weren’t highly educated I would go through life enduring the same struggles as they did, particularly with economic hardships. My parents fled the war in Eritrea and the military regime when they were in their early 20s and migrated to Sweden due to its receptiveness of immigrants, at the time. My father always described it as an involuntary move and longed for Eritrean independence. I always respected my parents’ wishes because I saw them sacrificing so much for my siblings and I and our everyday freedom. I was determined to make my parents proud so I told myself I’d keep making music fleetingly and one day I would get to do it full-time. But the more time that passed the harder it became. Five years ago I decided to attend law school at Fordham in New York City. This was yet another decision in my life based on fear and misguidance.  I was in my first year of law school when I began experiencing severe anxiety. I was falling behind in my studies and I was the girl nobody wanted in their study group. I felt like a complete outsider that did not belong there. And naturally that is how others in school viewed me as well, since what you reflect is what is returned to you, always. So everyday for three years I considered dropping out. But I never did. I never dared to take the leap though I was clearly unhappy. I just kept dipping my toes in the water but I never took the plunge. I just reached my word limit. But if you are interested in how my story unfolds it just so happens that I recently gave a TEDx talk on this subject (Spoiler alert: I took the plunge!). The title is “Use Your Voice Uniquely, As Only You Can.” I hope my story will inspire you to leave your non-self behind as well.

My stomach is in knots. I've felt knots before, but these knots are something else. Tight like a hug. Wriggly like a puppy. Warm like the sun on my face while my eyes are closed.

And joyful!

The fingers of joy are reaching up my spine, tickling my neck, setting my hair alight.

But then, reality! I open my eyes, and the sun is still warm. The puppy still wriggles. The hug is still tight.

This is real, this is here, this is now!

I am in my element. I can speak to each and every one of you without one bit of stage fright. Do you see me grinning?

Hello, Listservians! I am thrilled to address you today.

I spend time every day what-iffing and wondering, mostly about how my life could be different and how everyone else's life is different from mine. I'm nearly exploding trying to imagine all the different people reading this email. So many options, so many choices, so many differences. How about I tell you about who I am right now, and maybe you'll see how similar our differences are?

I am a writer. This is something that defines me, because if everything else were suddenly gone, I would still have words. I self-published a novel entitled Minotaur that's available on Amazon. I have two active blogs with Wordpress, one of which is the same as my email. That one's all about the writing. Fiction, nonfiction, and even a lone poem I wrote a few days ago.

I am a wife. My husband is amazing. I love him more than anything, and I don't know what I would do without him. We've been through some seriously hard times, but we can still make each other laugh, and that's what's important.

I have two 'real' part-time jobs. Whatever. A job's a job.

My parents moved in with us this year, and since my mom has had three surgeries in the past month, I've become her primary caregiver. It's not fun, and I salute those of you who can do this day in and day out, forever.

I live with four cats, a dog, and two turtles.

I love to read. Anything but Westerns.

I love to hike. My dream is to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail with my husband. We've never attempted a long distance hike, but we're both stubborn as hell. I think we'd make it. And love it.

I know it can be a challenge to appreciate the haves when you're hung up on the have-nots. I'm infertile. My husband and I tried for nearly a decade to conceive a biological child. We did not, due to lack of insurance coverage for infertility, lack of local resource availability, and lack of empathy from medical professionals.

I struggle with depression--another challenge when it comes to resources and empathy. Mostly, I deal with it. I've had plenty of practice. Sometimes medication helps. 

I have led an amazing life so far. Don't get me wrong, it's been unbelievably horrible at times. But a lot of cool stuff has happened. I mean, come on. I wrote a novel! I won the Listserve! I have made dozens of people happier! 

Advice? Of course advice. Embrace the thing that makes you great.

Thanks to Justine at A Half-Baked Life for introducing me to the Listserve!

I can't wait to hear from you. Really.

P.S. And dragons. My husband requested dragons.The best dragons are from Anne McCaffrey's Pern.

1.) Practice happiness. Daily. Beauty can be found in every nook and cranny.

2.) It’s never too late to learn something new. I just learned how to ride a bike and the feeling of the wind against my face makes me giggle. Maybe next I’ll learn how to knit socks or dismantle the patriarchy.

3.) Slam poetry is rad. Katie Makkai’s Pretty gives me goose bumps every time I watch it.

4.) I’ve always wanted to journal, but feel daunted at the thought of writing down all of my whereabouts and feelings. Instead I like to write down simple highlights of my days. It’s a little easier and reminds me that a life is made up of little moments like playing in the sand and eating cheese and building campfires.

5.) I’m a former world record holder for being apart of the longest line of consecutive touching tacos.

6.) My whole life I thought I was straight until my best friend told me that she had feelings for me. We’ve been together for a little while now and I’m completely in love with her. How funny it is that society teaches us to love a gender rather then individuals.

7.) Be kind.

8.) The best thing I did at college was to join the Ultimate Frisbee team. It’s a great sport with even greater people.

9.) Hold hands. There’s something cathartic about touch. I read an article once that spoke about the different hormones that are released through holding hands. I just think that it feels nice to be close to someone.

10.) Consume less, savor more, show people love.

It was my going away lunch and I was quitting to travel and start a business.  I flubbed a few words and haven't had a job since.  

As a kid I won some small science fairs and spoke at graduation and then finished college early.  I was a product of early access to computers and more than a few all-nighters.  That company I was working for was imploding after a string of mediocre mergers and the dot-com bust.  I just quit and didn't line anything up.  15 years later and I haven't hit the same level of income, but I have enough to own a house and have a great family.

You don't realize how much it's about personal development.  Every weakness is magnified tenfold.  You can get 20 things right and still fail on 15 others **.  Over time it starts to make sense.  Give me 20 years and I might have a hang of it.  Until then, it's a nice simple lifestyle.  I might be afraid to buy a newer car or take a week off, but I can set my own hours and don't have employees or a boss.

Good ideas aren't as important as tenacity.  In college I spent 4 days straight on a class project.  Friends brought me food from the dining hall.  I would roll over onto my bed to sleep and lost track of time.  The professor was impressed and suggested me for a job.  Years later, I can see how one project lead to another and doors opened up.  Though, my first two business ideas failed.  First, I lost weeks of programming to a drive crash.  Later, I remember walking into a supermarket with $12 that had to last a week.  Then a friend of a friend needed some help and I got my first customers and things got easier. 

Those were my finest moments.  As long as you are profitable, you can keep going.  At the worst I was earning $300/month.  I lived on rice and beans with vegetables and the occasional block of cheese.  At the same time, I learned another lesson.  Make sure you handle taxes, business filings, insurance, and legal stuff properly.  The state fined me $50 for being late on $12 of sales tax.  I wrote a nice letter explaining how I didn't know about it and I was just starting out, but still had to pay.

Along the way I also learned to do things myself.  We bought a cheap house and have been doing everything from wiring to car repair to roofing.  It's fun but also necessity.  Today my wife's car broke down.  It's relatively new so it was dumb luck and already fixed.  Having tools and experience from owning old cars made the surprise easy to deal with ***.  Keeping the expenses down means you don't have to bring in as much income which makes everything easier.  

Anyway, let me know if you have or want to start your own business.  I'd be happy to hear your thoughts or share some of mine.  

PS: 48 hours ago, I nearly ran into a very large bear on my mountain bike.  It shocked me into ""real life"".  I debated posting it on Facebook and then looked back in case it was chasing me.

It is the 23rd week and the doctor tells you that your baby won’t make it to 29 weeks.   29 weeks is where his odds of survival and against disability improve dramatically.  You are shown charts with sharply climbing curves.  You find where you are today.  This week, the odds of bad outcomes are 80 or 90%.  Next week, they are a little better, maybe only 70%.

You are asked: “Do you want to stay at the hospital?  You can, but we may take the baby sooner.”You are asked: “How ‘heroic’ should we be if there is no heartbeat at birth?”

You and your wife go home with your two older kids and Google these questions.  You discover that these questions are hard to answer.

2. So you decide to start a company.  You did once before and it turned out well, with a successful acquisition - maybe you can do it again?  You call your new company Roobrik and start building tools to help people make complex, high-stakes, emotional decisions.  You see both a need and an opportunity to focus on helping older adults and their families.  There are hundreds of decisions, big and small, and you realize they are the hardest most people will ever have to make.  It will be an honor, you decide, to one day help your parents have a good life, and on a more distant day, a good death.

3. Your band is called the Day Action Band.  You have a 7” on Numero and release three full-length albums.  When someone asks you where to start, you say go listen to “All Comes Down to This” all the way through, then maybe “Back of Your Car” because you always liked those songs.  You put them all up on iTunes, Spotify, Rdio, and Pandora years ago.  You include this section because (a) like all musicians you expect that one day your back catalog will be discovered by musicologists and ebullient youth for its shabby brilliance and (b) you wonder if Listserve exposure will register on your quarterly digital reports.

4. Your baby was born at the beginning of week 26.  He was 2 lbs, 2 oz, and lived in the NICU for two and a half months.  He came home with an oxygen tank and got tiny plastic glasses.  But he thrived, and at 4 he is healthy, as normal as any kid.  You are grateful for this.  For your good fortune and for good doctors, nurses, and science.  When your blood type comes back, and they tell you that, good news, it's teeming with rare antibodies helpful to preemies, you make a quiet pledge to yourself.

1.     I’m currently 17, male, and the 2nd oldest of 9 kids.

2.     I left high school at the sophomore level (I was 15 at the time) and joined a college with a charter program and now have an associates in economics and working towards a bachelors in either finance or marketing at the University of Las Vegas (UNLV).

3.     Eagle Scout.

4.     If it isn’t obvious yet, I’ve lived in Las Vegas my entire life.

5.     I fly multi-rotor vehicles (DJI Phantom 3 and Syma X5).

6.     I’ve always been LDS (More on that later if you don’t know what that means).Now to the fun part of the message, my actual life story:          Being born and raised in Las Vegas is something unique, besides it being around 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46C) during the summer, you get a taste of every culture and industry. From people that live in the hotels, to people who just visit for the weekend, and to the people that live in the suburbs (Summerlin/Henderson), you can get exposed to every lifestyle that exists. This has led me to more opportunities than I can count for.           Growing up in Vegas is a blessing, there is always something new to do, see, and live. Whether it may be a new show, exhibit, or outdoor activity, my childhood was filled with different experiences. As I continue my journey through the last of my teenage years, I have found that I have a series of choices that I need to make that will impact the rest of my life, and that frightens me. As a person who still doesn’t have a fully formed frontal lobe (As most people my age do), I can only hope that when I look back on my past self that I will be thankful that I somehow made the correct decisions to get to where I may go.These decisions include:

1.     Do I complete a master’s degree after my bachelor’s, or do I just stick with my bachelor’s degree?

2.     Do I serve a mission?

3.     Marriage?            If you read #2, you now probably know that I’m LDS, a Latter-day Saint, or “Mormon”, which explains the big family and mission. Regardless of what anyone says to me, I will always have the church to thank for my friends, my standards of always putting my best effort forward, and for giving me opportunities that I otherwise would not have had. Also if you have any questions regarding Latter-day Saints/Mormons, please email me, I will be more than happy to answer any questions regardless of what it may be (I don’t get offended very easily so ask anything whether it may be about our beliefs, standards, etc.).

This community is great, isn’t it? After the whole tiring day, reading your listserve e-mail makes me good because listening diverse stories, thinking about different experiences are cool things. Especially when the day slipped by ponderously.

I’m 24. I don’t agree with Benjamin Franklin. (“Most people die at 25 and aren't buried until 75.”) I have lots of wishes about life. These are motivated by living good thing and urge to keep going on. I’m software engineer however I’m not positive, this life-style suits me. I seek for it every day, until the day I find, I will. Are there any person like who I am?

Music

As an accordion lover, I suggest some great bands and musicians; Wintergatan, Detektivbyran, Beirut, Yann Tiersen, Astor Piazzolla.

Cities & Culture

Did I tell you I’m Turk? If you love traveling and have some plans, you should add Istanbul to your list. Even the city is chaotic and its cultural texture is getting worse and worse, you should see that living legend with your own eyes.

Books

İhsan Oktay Anar is one of my favorite author. The Atlas of Misty Continents is his great book. Other great book I’ve read recently, The Elegance of Hedgehog. Philosophy, culture, Paris, critique of Modernism.. Good balance.

Movies

Tim Burton! Beetlejuice, Big Eyes, Big Fish.

I arrive wearing thermal underwear, two long-sleeved t-shirts, a jumper, thick jeans and a winter coat but it’s not enough. Uncle’s apartment has no central heating, and I’m mildly appalled to see light snow drifting through the open windows. But the warmth of my welcome makes up for it.

“Everyone, Bing He has come.”

“Bing He, happy new year! Come sit down, have some tea!”

“Auntie! Happy new year!”

“Happy new year, everyone. I’m very happy to be here.” I get an adorable, toothy grin from my 9 year old niece. Tiny and well-mannered, she doesn’t accept my red envelope stuffed with cash until I force it into her hands.

They settle me on the sofa, and I watch my uncle arranging chopsticks and bowls of golden liquor around the many plates of food on the dining table. A place for each ancestor, I think, but I’m too shy to ask. I clutch a paper cup of hot green tea tightly in my hands as snow settles inside the room.

My niece watches tv, and my aunt interrogates me on my job and boyfriend. I evade her questions about where I stay when I’m visiting him in Shanghai. More relations knock on the door. More welcomes and hellos and Happy New Years!. I smile, say hello, fail to understand their dialect-accented Chinese, and huddle closer to my niece for warmth.

Relatives and friends pass in and out. My aunt lights a pair of fat red candles on the table, and drags a huge metal bowl into the middle of the floor. Uncle carries out a bundle of red strings and gold and silver paper. They look very different from the paper “Hell’s Banknotes” that my mother used to buy in London’s Chinatown.

Without much ceremony, aunt and uncle light the money for our ancestors on fire. Ashes drop into the metal bowl, and smoke starts drifting across the living room, obscuring the dancers fluttering on the tv.

I suddenly have one of those moments - a complete and utter awareness of being and place. If you like to travel, you might know what I mean. I am entirely aware with my whole being that I am in Dingqiao, in my uncle and aunt’s apartment, sitting on the sofa, with miles of residential blocks just like the one I was sitting in stretching all around. The gardens and apple trees of Wimbledon are very far away, and my breath is cold in my mouth.

It’s not a bad feeling. Sometimes I think that I travel just to experience moments like that.

We clear away the ashes and candles. Uncle disappears into the kitchen, and soon delicious aromas waft out. More relations arrive, my niece’s parents and more of my cousins, and it’s time to eat.

There is turtle and crab and salted pork, and much more. My favourite is niangao, soft rice sticks in sauce, very auspicious for a long life, they tell me. There are smiles around the table, and I take photos of everything for my mother.  “New year is so lively,” we all agree.

After watching hours of the New Year Gala on tv, where I’m disconcerted to see Celine Dion singing in Chinese, I go to bed. Bed is a wooden mattress, piled with quilts. I cover the bed with my clothes for extra warmth. I drift off to sleep to the sound of fireworks, exploding like cheers in the night sky outside.

However, with the recent U.S. Supreme Court hearing on same-sex marriage, this issue needs to be rationally and civilly discussed.  In explaining my beliefs, I don't want anyone to feel personally attacked. Sadly, some Christians and pseudo-Christians have shown hate and intolerance for the gay community. Forgive them. This hypocrisy is 180° polar to what being a Christ follower is all about!

I begin with a sincere moral belief:

As a Christian, I am morally opposed to the practice of homosexuality.

After reading that statement, you may judge me to be:

IGNORANT

CLOSED-MINDED

BIGOTED

HOMOPHOBIC

A HATER

Fill in the blank __________________

If you feel that way, I understand your reaction. You may wonder how anyone could think like that in our open-minded and ""tolerant"" society.  Shouldn't I be more tolerant and not judge?

 I'm a fool if what I believe is not true. However,  please allow me to attempt to show that those labels are not true about me and many others who hold similar beliefs.

 WE ALL JUDGE. ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. WE SHOULD, WE MUST.

You are judging right now, weighing my beliefs against yours. You judge everyone, even yourself. You judge which side of the road to drive on. (Get that wrong and you may appear before a judge). You make legal, ethical and moral judgments. While many judgments are based on external laws, I believe there are absolute moral truths innate to the universe.  People agree almost universally that lying, stealing, and murder are wrong. This is inherent to human nature. Observe young children playing and you will inevitably hear one say ""That's not fair!"" From birth we are moral creatures, continually choosing what is right and wrong. Judgment is part of our nature. We cannot function without making judgments.  We cannot NOT judge.

WE CANNOT JUDGE WITH RELATIVE STANDARDS

Let's  judge for ourselves what is right or wrong, you may say. However, if we each have our own ""truths"" and truth is relative, there is no real truth. Diametrically opposing beliefs cannot both be true. Consequently, we cannot even tell anyone what they ""ought"" to do. Absent a universal standard, we cannot measure what is right or wrong.  We couldn't even say  ""She shouldn't judge."" or ""He should be tolerant."" That would be judging.

TOLERANCE MEANS RESPECTFUL DISAGREEMENT

By definition, tolerance means  putting up with beliefs with which we don't agree. If you agree with someone, tolerance isn't necessary.

Tolerance  also means not forcing others to participate in and affirm our own beliefs. ""Don't like gay marriage? Don't get gay married."" Point well taken. "" Do like gay marriage?"" Don't force someone against their personal beliefs to directly take part in supporting it. Hate speech, lawsuits or fines for someone not willing to participate as  a wedding photographer or cater a gay wedding against a morally held belief is not tolerance. Should a gay print-shop owner be forced to print material teaching against the gay lifestyle?

This is distinctly different from someone being denied service at a restaurant, etc. Gay people are welcome in my life, but I should not be forced to act in violation of deeply held moral beliefs, nor should you be.

LET'S JUDGE WHAT IS TRUTH, NOT EACH OTHER

Don't judge ME or my RIGHT to what I believe.  I have the same tolerance for you. Please DO JUDGE  my BELIEFS. Agree or disagree?  I'd love to hear why.

July 2015,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/07/03/internet-needs-a-place-for-debates/,"July 2015, 03",Internet Needs A Place for Debates,"TL : DR : online debate almost always goes wrong. This is not a small issue and I think there is some solutions.

 - Why the fuck should I care about online debates ?

As Elon Musk said, Internet is like « the humanity’s nervous system ».More and more, the decisions taken together will be discussed on the Internet. People will consult Internet to make their minds on gay mariage, nuclear power plants or [Insert an issue you care about here].So, the way we manage debates on the Internet matters a lot, and its influence will only increase.

 -   Ok, and what is the problem with online debates actually ?

There is lots of problems.

First, it is rare when the conversation stays on the initial topic. If you’re familiar with reading  forums, you probably know about the « Godwin Point ». It is when an online conversation goes so wrong that somebody talks about Hitler/Nazis. I’ve seen Godwin Points on subjects like « Is windows better than Linux ? ». Throught pages and pages of conversation, people totally forget about the initial question and the debate goes nuts.

Second, personnal attacks. When somebody holds an opposite view, the easiest way is to attack him. If you want to see this, just watch anything on Youtube and read the comments. One quarter is personnal attacks, an other quarter is….

Third,  correcting spelling mistakes. When you are searching for relevant information, they are just noise.

Four, Trolls. An online conversation is very slippery by itself without people making fun of destabilize it.

Fifth, we always find the same points ! On gay mariage, for example, people will always have the same debate without any deepening in the subject.

[...]

 -  What solutions is there to enhance the level  ?

I believe all these issues are problems of bad structure. The forum framework, with people talking one after another, is not fitted for debates. People tend to respond to each other but, with a hundred people, it cannot work at all.

Look at popular websites like Twitter, Quora or Stack Overflow. These websites are successful because  they changed the structure of the conversation. Great containing attracts great content.

 -  What would be a good structure ?

I think the question should always be visible so people would stick more with it. The question should be as precise as possible.

Then, there is two columns : ""yes"" or ""no"". People are making points on one category or the other. Then, there is a system of votes for displaying the ""best"" arguments on the top of each column. This way, best arguments are always visible. There could be a characters' number limit, like in twitter, for readability.

This idea needs to be developped and I have a lot more to say about it.

I would love to have your feedbacks on it :Do you think this is a good idea ? Could it be a great website ? Would you use something like this ?

Thanks for reading me !

I always feel as if the world could swallow me whole at a moment’s notice and I think for the first time I’m realizing that there isn’t any sort of framework, much less a rescue strategy, for me to work through.

I thought I knew what I wanted and how my emotional and rational being worked after years of trying to figure out what the hell it meant to actually be human and why I was a part of this Earth — but everything I had unlearned and retaught myself stopped making sense around the end of December. But come mid-January when I left home again and went back to school I had found some kind of footing again. Come April, I was broken down again to a level I had never imagined exited.

The thing is that now when I lose all sense of understanding and comprehension of my rational thought, emotions, very essence of being, I fall to a measure that I once thought was something reserved for the dramatics of a desperate plot line in a TV show or book. Grasping at straws, playing to the audience, calling to the heavens in hope of saving face.

I feel as though I’ve learned very little, but of what little I do know I can feel to be the few honest truths that I always manage to find in the rubble after every thing else has fallen apart.

I know that my family is the single greatest blessing and consideration in my life, and that no matter the time, place, universe, whatever, I can conceptualize home and understand love through them. I know not everyone gets a family in a traditional sense, or even if they do it may be the furthest thing from comfort, but I know that eventually we all meet at least one person that somewhat feels like home. Not even necessarily a significant other or a lover of some sort, but simply a soul that doesn’t have to think twice about believing in you.

I know that kindness, consideration, and empathy make me human — and that only through and with them can my presence be felt on this Earth.

I’ve learned that assumptions ruin us and erode our nature; benefit of the doubt is the simplest and kindest human action that you can give any human being. Just teach yourself to default to seeing another’s humanness.

I know that the richness, diversity, and spectrum of life on this Earth are not by accident — we need it. I cannot exist without you or your experiences.

I know that regardless of what I try to appear I will forgive almost anyone and everyone who has wronged me, and even though I know it’s not healthy for me I still do it — and maybe it’s actually okay.

Lastly, I know You to be True, Kind, and Loving. And I pray that somehow I find that within myself.

Best and with care,

Myra

July 2015,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/07/01/stop-clicking-on-justin-bieber/,"July 2015, 01",stop clicking on Justin Bieber,"I got into journalism by interning at a DC-based (non-US) newsroom, which I now work for. Coming from the security contracting world, I carried lots of suspicions about how news is spun and how shallow journalists could be. I’m sure it depends on where you are but for me, my experience has not only proven against that but has given me a career I love and am proud of. Yes, if you look at big media in the US you will, unsurprisingly, find that there are various ‘patterns’ in who leads these companies and notice that there is a horrible lack of diversity--something I’m hoping will improve.

However, I think that far too often people blame the media for things that should be everyone’s responsibility. I’d like to point out that when you click on an article about Justin Bieber’s court hearing in Miami thousands of times more than you click on the article about the Rohingya, we’re going to focus more energy on Justin Bieber. The extent of that depends on how the news organization is funded, along with other factors, but generally you can assume your viewership matters.  Believe it or not, we actually don’t even want to be covering Justin Bieber ourselves! My newsroom consists of some of the most open-minded, astute and informed people I have ever met--one of the main reasons I got hooked and you can bet they’d prefer to report on something else! We count clicks, we observe views, we keep track of a lot of things so next time you’re on a news site or going through TV channels, browse responsibly!

There is no doubt that impulsive headlines are made and stories are blown out of proportion every day. However, I don’t think it would take long for someone to figure out who those networks are. So why not watch something else? IF you’re reading this, you have internet and if you have internet, you can figure out what news sources tend to do this less. It’s easy to blame your lack of action/awareness on something else and the media quite often deserves it but let’s keep it real and make the effort as well!

Thanks for listening and please reach out for comments--I’d love to hear from ya--especially if you have advice for a new journalist!

Because of this:

- I live in a town in the middle of Holland;- with an average distribution of various beliefs (Christians, both strict and lenient, Muslims, non-believers);- in a town that is often described as The Most Average Town in Holland.

- I live in the most common type of house in Holland (terraced, small front and back garden)

I have a loving husband, two teenage children (boy and girl of course).

In fact, everything is so average it is almost pretty special...

As promised, I want to clarify the Dutch attitude towards drugs.We have a clear distinction between soft drugs and hard drugs; the latter (heroin, cocaine, christal meth etc) is just as forbidden as in the rest of the world, and rightly so.Soft drugs (marihuana, weed, whatever you call it) is allowed in Holland. In fact, we have a shop in our town and I could buy some today. I even know a woman who works there, our kids went to the same school.  So, no big fuss about soft drugs in Holland...cigarettes are a lot more addictive and they are legal! The fact that soft drugs is so readily available takes away a lot of the mystery surrounding it: some teenagers use it, most stop when they are adults. It's just no big deal...many problems in Amsterdam are caused by tourists who see the city as a paradise filled with drugs and booze.

I could rant on forever on topics I find interesting, but I will end my contribution with a tip:  Rowan Atkinson in ""the devil Toby welcomes you to hell"" (Youtube, of course) Hilariously funny.

Take care,Marlies

You should read about unicorns (the billion dollar tech start-up kind and not the mythical creature kind--actually either-or should be interesting). 

So, I honestly don't have anything interesting or profound to say. This is a lot of pressure. Also, I don't think I am wise enough (yet) to give life changing advice. However, I am more of a listener, so I'd love to hear from you. 

I guess I can share the fact that I will be turning 27 years old this weekend. It could be just me, but isn't there something scary about birthdays? I'm one of those people who doesn't celebrate birthdays--my own that is. It makes me think about death and the purpose of life more than anything, so I'd rather just treat it like any other day and get past it, and then think about death and the purpose of life on other days. Too dark? :-) 

Anyways, this is probably the least eloquent and most random Listserve you've ever read, but I'm pretty sure I'm missing the deadline to submit this in as it is, so please excuse the grammar. 

Oh, and am I allowed to ask people to follow me on Instagram? If so, this may be my only chance to ask a bunch of people to follow me and my best friend on IG: SkkyyRaiinn and MrRickyWang, respectively ;)

As great as the show is, I keep finding myself reminiscing about the time I farted on the show's lead, Matt Dillon. Let me paint the scene.

The Time: 2006, Lindsay Lohan was the hottest star in Hollywood and Facebook was a means to show how popular you were and not for old people sharing pictures of their grandchildren (I know what my nephew looks like Mom).The Place: Some swanky restaurant in Tribeca. It must have been for some special occasion as I don't frequent swanky restaurants or Tribeca. Possibly the fart was premeditated, I dunno, I was 16 and I've drank a lot of booze since then.

The Story: I finished my meal and shortly thereafter nature called. What's an acne riddled boy supposed to do? Fart on Matt Dillon. Wait no, I'm getting ahead of myself. Go to the bathroom, that's what I did. The men's room in this place was one of those bathrooms where it's just a urinal and a stall, it was up for debate on whether or not it is for individual use or for the masses. I went ahead and made the call in my mind, this bathroom must be a private, one person, leave me alone kind of bathroom. So I go to the urinal and start doing my thing. At this point I should mention the music was quite loud in there, playing the popular hit of the time (probably It's Goin' Down or some such nonsense). Because of the blaring music, I failed to hear Matt Dillon not respect the laws I set in my mind about this being a private bathroom, entered and then stood behind me waiting for the urinal. Unaware of my visitor, I let one rip, better there than on someone's entree in the restaurant. It eventually comes time to flush and turn around and I see the man who would one day star in You, Me, and Dupree. At first I was just surprised to see someone there, then I realized who the guy was. I apologized (while suppressing laughter) and left the bathroom.

Epilogue: A week or so later, M. Deezy (when you share a bond like that, you get to give each other pet names) was at the Oscars and lost for Best Supporting Actor for the film Crash, where he played some shmuck that did shmucky things. It really bums me out, I was really banking on being able to say I farted on an Oscar winner. Maybe he'll win an Emmy for his role on Wayward Pines, but saying you farted on an Emmy winner just isn't the same.

That's my story, sorry for the toilet humor.

June 2015,27,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/06/27/camp-special-needs-and-waterslides/,"June 2015, 27","Camp, special needs and waterslides","Summer camp is a kind big deal for me. No, not a kind of a big deal, kind of HUGE deal.  It hasn't actually been the times I was a camper that have been a big deal, but really when I was on the other side of it, as a counselor and unit head.  Camp Ramah is a Jewish sleep-away camp located in a small but amazing town called Ojai in California.  It’s a place that I have called my home from June until August for the past 7 years and it’s a place that I hold very near and dear to my heart.  I had my first kiss at camp, my first ""going against the grain"" moment and my first moments of questioning my own beliefs, but I think the strongest part of my experience has been the people I have met.  I have been lucky enough to make incredible friendships with people who were my age, years older or even years younger than me.  Just imagine; you get to remove yourself from your  ""typical"" environment and are able to live in a place encompassed by mountains, trees and fresh air.  A place where you don’t have to be afraid to confine to the “norms” of society.  You truly get to be the best version of yourself.

For the past two years, I have had the privilege of being the “Rosh” (or unit head) for a very incredible group of kids.  The Tikvah program at Camp Ramah is a program for campers (Amitzim) and staff members (Ezra) with special needs.  Just like the rest of the 550 other typical campers, kids in Amitzim get to go down the pool waterslides everyday, play sports, enjoy music, and even go on an overnight to sleep under the stars.   At Ramah, these kids get to be the rock stars of camp, a place where they are treated as campers who are awesome, fun loving and very special.  Living in a world where this community typically doesn’t get this much positive attention has changed the way that I live my life.  Not in a drastic way, but in a way in which I am more aware of the different types of people around me and the way that I engage with them.  I feel very blessed to be a part of this community.

However, this is the first summer that I will not be back at this camp.  I just finished my first year of teaching kindergarten and I am ready grow and to try new things.  Part of me really envies the people who are working there (both family members and friends) and get to partake in the magic of camp, but a part of me is excited for the opportunities in the future.  If you get the chance, I highly recommend going to camp.  Whether you’re a kid or an adult, it doesn’t matter.  There is a camp out there for you.  And if you can’t be at camp, then at least live by the camp mantra and try to be the best version of yourself.

Thanks Emily for telling me about the Listserve years ago and being the best co counselor out there!! You’re an amazing Rosh and I’m so proud of what you’re doing at camp! I also want to tell my boyfriend Jared that I’m very proud of all of your hard work studying for the California Bar!  Also Brian, you just finished at GW and are moving on to amazing things, helping the world one day at a time.  Love you Vanessa, Amanda, Emily, Mom and Dad!!

June 2015,26,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/06/26/when-life-happens/,"June 2015, 26",When Life Happens,"Something I’ve learned in my young life is that things change. Period. You can’t predict them happening and some will have a bigger effect than others, but it’s how you respond to these changes that makes you who you are, and ultimately decides the path your life takes.   

Therefore, I am going to tell you, 23,740 of my newest friends, something that only a few of my closest friends and family know. I am moving to London from New York City! I have never been to London and barely know anything about it.

  How’s that for a life change?

  In the past month, my girlfriend and I broke up, and my company started looking for someone similar to me in our UK office. I raised my hand, and they bought my pitch. It’s funny how the timing of things works out sometimes.  

The breakup devastated me, things weren’t always great but it still came as a shock, and having the most meaningful relationship I’ve had end, was hard to swallow. We both got too comfortable and settled in, rarely taking time to appreciate each other.

  I wish someone kept reminding me these few things along the way: do the small things and be selfless when tending to your partner – it’s chivalrous and essential. Travel, have adventures, and keep things interesting, it goes much further than you’d expect.  Lastly, don’t just live your life with an end-goal in mind, enjoy the steps along the way.

  But, we march on.

  I am a man of many interests, and a few passions. I work in Corporate Finance, and I love my job. My ultimate goal is to start and run a company, and my job allows me to get the inside scoop on what makes a business successful. Something that will serve me well later in life.   

While I enjoy what I do, it doesn’t fully define who I am. I coach a 12U travel baseball team in Manhattan (yes, even the Concrete Jungle has some green patches). I played baseball all the way through college, but coaching has taken my love for the game to a new level. I plead with you to find something you’re passionate about in life and act on it.

  Moving to London is the biggest risk I’ve taken, and I couldn’t be more excited. I’ve only been to Europe once (to Ireland) and don’t know what I am getting myself into, but I’m ready for the adventure.   

Lastly, the biggest realization I’ve had in my 26+ years is: To be happy, you must be completely honest with yourself first. As an optimist, it’s one of the hardest things for me to do, always seeing things as better than they actually are. But I’m working at it, and am ultimately in a better place. Before I leave for work each day, I think about what’s truly important to me, keeping those thoughts in mind throughout the day. Take care of yourself first, and everything else will fall into place.

  As John Lennon reminds us, “Everything will be okay in the end. If it’s not okay, it’s not the end.”  

I am writing this on Father’s Day, which reminds me of two principles my dad has instilled in me.

  “If you have the choice to either be right or kind, choose kind.”  “Work when no one is watching, but work as if everyone is watching.”   

Thanks, Dad.     

If any of this post resonated with you tell me why! Also, I barely know anything about London, so suggestions of neighborhoods, restaurants, or hidden gems are encouraged.  Talk soon,  Frank

It doesn’t matter where that sound has come from but what you do with it.I like to stretch sounds, I like to bend sounds, I like to layer sounds. I don’t tend to write songs, or rhythms or melodies – I like to create textures.I like to create many layers of texture and then blend them together – sometime random, sometimes planned – see what happens.Listen back and fill the gaps. Not enough bass, too much treble, too little going on – well fix that – add another layer, copy a layer and distort it some more, reverb – perhaps, or some echo, or EQ out most frequencies, cut it down and loop it, delete it.When it sound complete, mix it down, if it doesn’t – put it aside, come back to it, days weeks or months later – the beginnings are easier than finishing it off. Circuit Monster:It begins with a guy, and me – him in Japan, me over here.We each record drum machine tracks – on various things and send them too each other.We then layer electronic music over each other’s drum machine tracks, we tend to use sequencers.So much different to the method above and differently satisfying – and more akin to what I used to do – before getting into the ambient-industrial I described above and after the industrial bands I mention below. In the 90’s I was involved in many musical projects, all with an industrial/punk-rock bent which played live; TMA-1, C.O.D, Spastic Crunch, Placenta Cookbook, Kerosene, Whispering City, The Aesthetics, The Strap-Ons,  notv, and MiG-21 to name the more important ones.What did I do in these? – I played bass, and guitar, and keyboards, and drums. I wrote lyrics, I programmed drum-machines, I bashed pieces of metal, I played backing tapes from cheap tape recorders, I played kazoo and sang.What did I learn from all these? – you don’t really need to learn to play an instrument properly – what’s the point in that – it’s useful if you want to play other people’s songs – but to make your own just go for it – tune the guitar to suit yourself – use the keyboard as a source of noise the bass as a source of rhythm – and go for it – have fun –that’s what music should be about. If you’d like to hear any post-2000 notv / robotMONSTER or Circuit Monster drop me a line – I’ll send you some links. Or send me some links of yours.

Here are some of my favourite questions from actual tests in INTEG120 Introduction to the Academy, INTEG251 Creative Thinking, FINE274 Figure & Anatomy, FINE204 The Art, Science & History of Colour, and PSYCH306 Perception.

1. One of the basics of working well with other people is learning their names. There are thirty-five students in this class. Name them. Yes, you may look around. No, you may not signal to one another. [5]

2. On this Lucian Freud painting, Naked Portrait, 2005, mark the left medial malleolus with a star. [1]

3. Why is this xkcd cartoon (552) funny? [4]

4. Bloom’s Taxonomy describes six levels of abstraction at which we know a subject. Name them, in any order. For each level of Bloom’s Taxonomy, write a non-trivial question about insects that would give a student a chance to demonstrate meaningful mastery of some insect-related subject. [12]

5. This notorious Ithaca Times cover illustration appears to show tuition at Cornell University skyrocketing while quality plummets. Graphs of the source data are shown below it. Describe at least three deceptive practices that make this cover perhaps “the most misleading graph ever published.” [6]

6. Recently, while working in a national park in Indonesia, British nature photographer David Slater had his camera swiped by a (critically endangered) crested black macaque. Before Slater recovered it, the macaque took some photos that were widely published. An American website, techdirt, published some of them in an online article about the intellectual property issues involved. Now Caters News Agency, the UK agency which represents the work of Mr. Slater, has asked techdirt to take down the photographs. What type(s) of intellectual property protection might apply in this case? Who “owns” the photographs, and why? Should techdirt take down the photographs, and why? In your argument, discuss the costs and benefits to the parties involved and to society. [10]

7. Imagine a world-class athlete, long retired and now a healthy but frail senior citizen. Considering the model of expertise described in Malcolm Gladwell’s article, The Physical Genius, do you believe that athlete is still a physical genius? Why, or why not? [5]

8. Imagine that a person with congenital achromatopsia takes the colour course. She’s smart. She practices and studies hard. Thinking about the content and assessment, what mark do you predict she would get, and why? [5]

9. Imagine that humans suddenly develop a new sense, the ability to detect the age of an object or organism by touch. It is first detected in a seamstress who can reliably tell apart vintage silk dresses and modern replicas made with new silk fabric although they seem to be identical in appearance, materials and construction. Many or most other humans develop this sense, and are able to sort almost everything—carrots, cars, castles and cats—by age. Imagine that you are pioneering the psychophysical research to establish the properties of this new sense. Describe the procedure of a useful experiment you could conduct and what possible pattern(s) of results you would expect to find. [5]

Imagine that this sense is attributed to a new sensory receptor—the age-o-tron—that seems to have four types (fast- and slow-adapting, with large or small receptive fields). What type(s) of stimuli do you hypothesize would have the strongest effect on each age-o-tron, and why? [8]

FINALLY, AS ON EVERY TEST I GIVE, THE METACOGNITION BONUS: So far, this test is out of 61 marks. How many do you estimate you have earned? If you are within plus or minus 5, I will give you a 3% bonus on your overall grade.

I was the support act along the way, saw a few new-to-me American cities and a few I've seen before, but none of them stood out to me like New York always seems to.

New York City is the only city of the ones we visited that I grew up a 30 minute train ride from, but somehow it was still the one city on tour where I felt like I had so much more to see. New York, to me, is endless. I'm not yet sure if that infinite feeling will ever go away.

Since the tour, I've finally decided to stop living out of my childhood home and out of spare bedrooms that my friends have offered up in California and choose a place that I can call my own home. I'm two years out of college at this point, and it definitely feels like it is time to settle in somewhere. To be honest, I didn't really consider doing that anywhere except for New York... I'm not sure if it's the never-ending feeling that swirls around the city, the amount of culture and music that resonates through all of the streets all of the time, or if it's just simply the most practical place for me to be right now. I worry about it just being that last one.

Right now, I'm pursuing a career in music, so naturally I'm also working 9-5 in midtown at a job that I never really expected myself to be doing-- I'm truly not passionate about it and I'm not utilizing any of the skills that I've acquired throughout my life. Honestly, I actually don't really do much of anything here... at all. It may seem like a dream scenario; go in to work, do next to nothing, and walk home every week with a decent-enough paycheck to live in one of the world's biggest cities. It doesn't even sound that bad to ME when I put it that way, but I've never been one to get satisfaction from being lackadaisical. I've always derived happiness and self-worth from hard work, passion, and dedication. I get none of that satisfaction here.

In fact, I've turned this desk at work into a home office of sorts-- I'm writing this listserve email from this office, I also planned the entire month-long March tour from this office, and I spend a majority of my days here working with someone I care about so much (he actually showed me this listserve!) on furthering his music career and continuing mine. These are the things I can cite that I'm proud of at this point, this office has served as a vehicle for those things and I'm grateful for that.

And so I have finally moved to this great city... last week. I'm hoping that this move to New York will change things, that I will find my place in the city that never ends, that the electricity from the streets will seep into my veins and start pumping passion and excitement through my body again or it will at least shock me out of this place of comfort that's feeding discomfort. Even after spending so much time here, there's so much of New York City left to see and I truly hope it leaves me feeling infinite myself.

Hope you're all well! ReginaNew York, NY

June 2015,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/06/22/not-a-raging-bull/,"June 2015, 22",(not a) Raging Bull,"Jake la Motta was rescued from a favela in São Paulo, abandoned, unfed and bound by a rusty chain link that allowed him no mobility. With doleful brown eyes and protruding ribs, he showed only signs of gratitude as his rescuers slowly nursed him back to health. 

We first saw Jake as he was exiting the park with his rescuer. With short white fur, a big heart-shaped head and small (then undernourished) body, I surely thought he was a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, aka ""the nanny dog."" After weighing many pros and cons, we adopted him one week later. We sat and brainstormed names, and inspiration came from the movie Raging Bull (laden with irony).

But as the weeks passed, we found that Jake was not quite a Staffy. He is larger than the breed's size and we learned that there are no red-nosed white Staffies. Most likely, he is a pit bull mix, yet his exact breed remains a mystery. Whatever the lineage, he is a big hunk of love, entirely grateful for his new home and becoming healthier every day. 

Up until the day I met Jake, I too held a bully breed stigma. Pit bulls undoubtedly have extremely strong and large jaws, and Jake had to be trained from the get go that biting was not an acceptable way to play. As far as dogs go, in no way is he vicious, violent or aggressive. A dog's temperament is dependent on the capabilities of its owner. Yet clearly, by reactions I get when I mention Jake is a pit bull mix, not everyone agrees.

A few months ago, a nationally prominent news anchor and radio show host in Brazil, Ricardo Boechat, spoke of an incident during his morning broadcast, wherein a camera man covering a news story in Curitiba was bitten rather gravely by a pit bull. Stating as fact that pit bulls are vicious animals and unsuitable as pets, Boechat denigrated the breed with great conviction, leaving no room journalistic objectivity (Boechat also advocates that the best vote is the null vote). Yet consider the circumstance: on the day of the incident, a protest reaching 10,000 people was held by schoolteachers on strike from the state of Paraná. The police eventually intervened using rubber bullets and stun bombs, and more than 200 people were injured, protesters and police alike. During this confusion, a camera man was bitten by a police dog. The footage can be found on google: ""cinegrafista pitbull.""

To Ricardo Boechat, opinion is not fact until proven as such, something I would expect those with public influence to respect and uphold. As a Korean who was born in Brazil and grew up in the States, I have dealt with stereotypes my entire life, and have become increasingly intolerant of them.

One of my favorite Listserve emails was from Vibeke, who asked Instagram users to post what they were doing at the moment. In that spirit, I too am curious to see what types of stereotypes Listserve users deal with on a daily basis. Tag them with #LSbreakingstereotypes

That which made me succeed with the bicycle was precisely what had gained me a measure of success in life -- it was the hardihood of spirit that led me to begin, the persistence of will that held me to my task, and the patience that was willing to begin again when the last stroke had failed. And so I found high moral uses in the bicycle and can commend it as a teacher without pulpit or creed. She who succeeds in gaining the mastery of the bicycle will gain the mastery of life."" - Frances E. Willard

""Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives a woman a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. It makes her feel as if she were independent. The moment she takes her seat she knows she can't get into harm unless she gets off her bicycle, and away she goes, the picture of free, untrammelled womanhood."" - Susan B. Anthony

""Get a bicycle. You will not regret it, if you live."" - Mark Twain

I have been yearning for heights ever since I was a kid. I climbed to the top of the beech tree in my parents’ back yard, I clambered on the roof of their barn and my preferred reading spot was the top of my bookcase, where I squeezed myself between the top shelve and the ceiling, until I grew too big and the bookcase collapsed.

When I was older, I tried to climb the highest peak of every new country I visited. Reaching a peak is always a euphoric experience.I’m good at euphoric experiences. I never look for them, but I find them in spring days, in friends talking to friends, in traveling by train, in music, in the smell of a lawn mower and in the friendly greeting of a mentally retarded man at the supermarket. I find them in breathing the air and letting my feet take me wherever I want them to. I have a talent to marvel at little things, and I often feel happiness bubble up in my stomach, finding its way out through songs, dances and tears of pure bliss. It makes me feel like a loony, but I’m fine with being a happy loony.

It’s not always like this. High mountains lack oxygen, and one can only reside on their peaks for a short amount of time. As I descend from my peaks of euphoria, I nest myself in the valley, leading a normal life like most of us do. But while I’m there, an old fear of the deep sea starts to arise.

I am terrified of the deep sea. Its endless emptiness, its lack of sunlight and its hideous demons of the deep make my hands sweat when I think of it. Those demons are hollow-eyed creeps, sharp teethed, dead silent and elusive. They show up in the back of my head, nagging that “no, of course your life’s not worth it, because you fail to choose between an epic and an ethical life, and so you’re forever caught in the valley of mediocrity. Of course it’ll never be better, because after all deep philosophical thought, the baseline will always be that life itself has no real meaning outside the meaning you give to it, and if you’re not capable of enjoying it, you could just as well quit.” They disguise themselves as Truth and the harder I try to look away, the bigger they grow, until they take up every square inch of my head, leaving only room for the agony of wishing it would end-end-end.

Luckily, deep seas lack oxygen as well. My demons of the deep may eat me alive, but they always spit me out on the shores of my valley, like Jonah was spit out by the Whale after three days and nights of darkness.

The question is this: if it was possible, would I be able to say farewell to my beloved mountains, in order to  deep sea demons? Could I bear to live with the peaks of euphoria in sight, realizing I will never again enjoy their splendid views?  Should I sacrifice my highlands to rid myself of the emptiness, becoming even-minded and well balanced?

I think not. If I try to be less afraid of emptiness, and not to struggle when they try to eat me, maybe these monsters will be tamed. Maybe not. But as long as I can end up like Noah on mount Ararat when the water level falls, I will endure.

I'm not necessarily happier now than I was before, but there's a whole new layer to my life. In a way things are more complicated. 

A few years ago my uncle had shocked me when he told me that his wife was more important than his kids, that he loved her more than them. I don't have children, but I can imagine feeling the same way for Nathalie if/when we have wee copies of ourselves.

I work a lot (and love the job), so I don't have a lot of free time. And now a good deal of that spare time is spend with the love of my life. But that means that some of what I used to I can't anymore or it doesn't get done with any kind of priority.

But the upside is getting to spend time with someone who is frankly fantastic, more than I could've reasonnably asked for. And most importantly she challenges what I used to consider as priorities.

I’m a doula. It’s Greek for “a woman who serves”. My job description is Professional Birth and Postpartum Support Person.

It means that I attend births. I massage and braid hair and remind everyone to take a sip of water. I sway and count and breath to match the laboring mother’s pace. I tell her to reach down and feel her baby’s head. I watch babies take their first breath. Sometimes I pace the halls waiting to be escorted to a post-op recovery room. I take pictures and see the room erupt in tears and smiles. I witness families expand and double their capacity for love. I see women transform into mothers, and I share her “birth high”- there is oxytocin and adrenaline coursing through every vein in the room.

It means that I’m a birth nerd. I watch documentaries about the infant microbiome, breastfeeding, and home birth. I search youtube for vaginal breech delivery videos. I read books about maternity care in the US and the midwifery model of care. I research holistic care for pregnancy. I am obsessed with learning more about how women can GROW NEW HUMANS in their bodies. It’s fascinating.

It means that I’m a friend. I hug, listen to, and cry with mamas when they share their birth story. I spend long nights rocking fussy babies so their parents can sleep. I watch babies “latch on” and remind mamas to relax their shoulders as they nurse. I wash bottles and fold tiny baby laundry. I tag along grocery shopping and to doctors appointments so a new mama doesn’t have to go alone. I’m present and available, and I understand that the 4th trimester is hard.

It means that I am a business owner. I create contracts and confidentiality releases. I hold liability insurance. I pay dues to networking organizations. I am self-employed, and file taxes as such (wah wah).

It means that I am participating in something as old as human existence, but that is new every day. I am part of the changing birth culture in San Diego, in California, and in the US. I work alongside other doulas, midwives, childbirth educators, lactation consultants, body workers, nurses, obstetricians, and mothers who are PASSIONATE about improving birth.

It’s demanding, beautiful, fulfilling work. I do it because birth matters.

Dance hurts but the rewards you reap are sweet. When you first start for the day, it's stiff and doesn't flow, and you need to get into the rhythm of it. Once you do, you focus hard, striving to perfect every minor flaw in your performance. You dance with vigor, intensity, but soon some flaws escape your notice and you grow ignorant of technicalities. Now is the stage where you dance with heart, not perfection. Your body is a summer breeze, movements flowing like water, all connected and balanced on the scale of the universe. Flaws and flawlessness meld, creating a form which is pure and true and utterly human. The spotlight shines on you as you dance for your own pleasure; you stand strong and firm as you flow to the rhythm while your legs feel like they could collapse any moment. But you don't care, for you are numb to anything but the beat.

I'm a midlevel career type of person, no kids, unmarried. I help take care of my sister's children. I have normal hobbies (reading, visiting museums, seeing concerts, etc.). I'd like to meet someone but dating is the pits.  I'm also suffering a midlife crisis. Midlife crises are seen as jokes. Balding men who drive sports cars or take up motorcycling. The reality is that 40 hits you like a ton of bricks. Even if you don't look or emotionally feel what 40 is ""supposed"" to look and feel like, your aching bones, persistent gray hairs, and looming fear of getting old tell you otherwise. My life, for all intents and purposes, is half over. And the other half of this life gets tired and gains weight really easily. It worries about a mostly pointless career and would often rather stay home in bed, reading a book.  I'm guessing most on this list are younger than 40. Here's what I wish I had done before this point:1. Not wasted time in relationships I knew were doomed. 2. Not gotten complacent at jobs for years, letting my skills atrophy.3. Worked harder to improve and push myself in my career and personal life.4. Taken so many more chances – moved around, switched jobs, dated more.5. Travel, travel, travel. This time next year, I hope I'll be teaching English in Mexico or South Korea or Thailand. I've wasted too much time and money on things that aren't fulfilling.  When I die, I'll be happier that I quit my job and traveled than if I had worked more hours to buy more stuff.  All we are is the sum of our experiences and our kind acts toward others. --Laura  P.S.

June 2015,12,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/06/12/wordless-words-on-joni-mitchell/,"June 2015, 12",Wordless words on Joni Mitchell,"Do you know how to speak about what you love?

Joni Mitchell has been in the news a lot, and for once when I see her name and hear it I flinch and do not want to know. Others do not know how I feel about her except that I do. I love to write, yet when it comes to Ms Mitchell, I do not have a word.

I've gotten this question a lot, as though I am somehow the go-to source when I am the most unreliable source you could ask: who is Joni Mitchell? I pretend I don't hear, though I pay attention by principle. I will try an answer for you listserve readers (though really, spare others the pain and just use google): Joni Mitchell is a folk and jazz singer-songwriter known for her ""weird chords"" and a song she came to regret about Woodstock, written early in her development. She is an artist, a recluse, frustratingly  standoffish and a painter (""I live in a box of paints"").

Joni Mitchell is sick. Reports on her condition varied from the apocalyptic to the utterly blasé. I have been ducking into bathroom stalls to glance at them, and now, just ignoring them completely.

I used to feel lonely about my wordless connection to Ms. Mitchell. I wanted someone in my small hometown to recognize the wave that transported me from my headspace to somewhere of renewal with word and sound for what I lacked, that sometimes happened as early as the first few chords of ""All I Want"" and sometimes took until the strange spiraling vocals of ""My Old Man."" I thought that if someone could understand the ins and outs of Blue than they would know my longings and aches and feelings of completion.

There is a reason for sound, and weird chords, and belted proclamations that could be quietly scratched down on a notepad. I know this, and yet, I doubted myself the first time I was face to face with another Joni Mitchell fan and didn't know what to say. I didn't want to perform her (""Oh, you know For the Roses is perineally overlooked""), nor to reduce her to girlish exclamations of love. And my friend said a few words about Court and Spark and I nodded and then found myself switching to another topic, my mind hollow and buzzing, confused and deliberately so.

I believe in words, and yet: words lack the fullness, shape, sensory affront that occurs when they become translated to sound, when they slide deeper into emotion as they become music. The alternate world of song is different from that of literature: rather than the literary effect of being transported into an alternate world, as a listener, the world of albums is still mine, more purely and richly mine than a busy mind could ever plan.

Joni Mitchell is sick and part of me feels sick. It isn't fair to her. She doesn't owe anyone her soul. I don't want her as a cult of personality and she wants it even less. I have been frozen because: she deserves due testimony, deserves so much more, and I do not know how or where to even begin professing it.

Reader, I meant to write more to you. But rest assured. I am grateful, and I want to know the speechless parts of you.

Straya.,"Hey Listservers,  I've been on here for a long time now and was starting to think the winning email had forgotten about me; yet here we are.  I'm 23, am what's known as a 'Third Culture Kid' and currently call the landmass of Australia home. My story: As a baby, I grew up during the apartheid in South Africa. Despite personally having no recollection of events, my parents must have been concerned enough as we moved to Switzerland, the opposite to South Africa in pretty much every way.  We didn't stop there though, 5 years (and 1 little brother) later we packed up again to move closer to family, this time to Australia.  Adelaide, South Australia is where we settled, to be with family on dad's side.  Now Adelaide is a special place. Instead of the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, it's the 2 degrees of Adelaide (no, seriously, 2 degrees, I've never broken this rule).  We are home to the highest number of serial killers and churches in Australia (coincidence?) and even when visiting the city centre, it still feels like a massive country town.  That is to say, people are still friendly!  If you like warmth, wine and all kinds of festivals and sports, Adelaide is your place to be from Dec-Apr. A bit about me: I was boring and straight laced growing up, opting to tread the path that everyone else expected me to (school, degree, job, family, kids). I was offered a good job out of uni in corporate IT, a decision made difficult by requiring re-location interstate, away from a girlfriend and life I'd come to seriously love. That one year in corporate IT turned out to be the worst year of my life, experiencing a break-up for the first time, losing touch with a big portion of people I considered friends and generally finding it difficult to be living out of home so far from everything.  But with every cloud comes a silver lining, and with it is one piece of advice which I will impart on you. Never let others get in the way of the things that you want to do and never expect people will always be there for you.  With that advice in mind, I am now back in Adelaide and have co-founded an IT start-up to focus on business apps, hopefully you will use our products one day! If you: skate, skim, surf, snowboard, are also from Adelaide, love IT/tech or are an IT entrepreneur, hit me up with an email!

A Story:

One night a good friend (Luke)  and I went to a field for a bonfire and stargazing. While there, Luke got a phone call from a friend. I took the opportunity and slipped away with a handful of post it notes in my pocket. See I desperately needed to pee. Covering my tracks I walked a huge circle away from Luke into the dark. Behind a hay bale I did my business. I also left a few post it notes behind that had helped my endeavor and got back to the fire.  After Luke got off the phone he left to answer nature’s call - behind the same hay bale.    When he got back he was holding several pink post it notes in his hand. When I asked him why he had them he explained he’d found them and wanted to check them out in the light to see if they had words  on them. I could not stop laughing. But finally after a good 10 minutes of silent gut clutching laughter i told him he should really get rid of the post its. “Why?” he asked. “because they're pee post its!”  and then another burst of laughter. Ah, I love curious people. Only curious people can get into predicaments like handling toilet paper post it notes.

I am a 23 year old male, an economics student, down to earth and born in The Netherlands.As a 23 year old I suffer from the common modesty of youth on the Listserve and I don’t know what to talk about.

I feel that the only thing larger than the amount of things I don’t know is my curiosity.

Every time I learn something new, whether it is a scientific fact, whether it is someone’s emotions or my own new experiences, I can grow as a person. For me learning and spreading knowledge is something I am passionate about.

Last year has been full of experiences, with studying hard, meeting my wonderful girlfriend, parents divorcing, myself moving to a different city and having a friend of mine diagnosed with cancer. I see everything life throws at me and I learn from it.

People are resilient and people are wonderful. I care for the people around me and I learn something new every day.

Please write to me with anything, questions, stories from around to world, I would love to hear from you, new stuff to learn!

I would never have thought I would end with a poem, but it struck me watching a movie (I love movies!) the other night and it fits me very well:Out of the night that covers me,Black as the pit from pole to pole,I thank whatever gods may befor my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstanceI have not winced nor cried aloud.Under the bludgeonings of chancemy head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tearslooms but the Horror of the shade,and yet the menace of the yearsfinds, and shall find me, unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,how charged with punishments the scroll,I am the master of my fate:I am the captain of my soul.

(Invictus, William Ernest Henley)

I am grateful for my life and the chances I have had. More and more I realize that as a white male, born in Western Europe, in a higher education I have the maximum amount of opportunities one could possible wish for.

Even though this may help me to achieve a lot by normal standards of society, I must not forget that which is most important in life. To have people around you who love you and to take this love, multiply it a thousandfold and return it to them.

Love,

Felix

It wasn’t fair: the teacher hadn’t taught me how to spell the word and made me take the test anyway. But instead of getting over it, I begged my mom to transfer me to another school.

See, by that point my single mom and I had already moved more than half a dozen times that year. We changed cities every few weeks as my mom sought treatment for her brain injury. Sometimes we slept on cots in crowded churches or battered women's shelters. One weekend we stayed in a luxury hotel through some wealthy donor’s generosity. After we landed on our feet and had several years of stability, high school saw me move cross-country and change schools again every fall.

All this moving around had a big impact on me. School was the one area of my life where I had control. Great teachers like Thomas Brown at South Fallsburg Jr./Sr. High (thank you Mr. B!) inspired me to devote my weekends to the SATs and apply to top colleges. With his help in particular, I got a full-ride scholarship to an Ivy League university. Today, thanks in no small part to socioeconomic affirmative action, I’m a student at Harvard Law School.

But there were serious downsides to always being the new kid. I found it easier to teach myself material for AP exams than to form new friendships over and over again. I acted goofy for attention but struggled with loneliness and awkwardness. Weird nicknames grew on me like barnacles: “Elmer,” “Shakespeare,” “Bush.” Early in college I still struggled to make friends and took refuge in a string of intense but impermanent romantic relationships. With few deep friendships or family ties, I had little experience dealing with conflict and prioritizing relationships over “winning.”

I like to think that I’m well adjusted these days, but I still have my cringe-worthy moments. (Like this email, in all likelihood.) For anyone else who has ever felt like they could have better social skills, here’s some advice that has helped me overcome my baggage:

- Attend a Vipassana meditation course. I went on a 10-day retreat and walked out feeling like a different person. College / graduate students out there: go during a summer break before you have to use up vacation days! Don’t worry about costs, it’s donation-based and carpooling is available. Just do it!

- Practice meditating daily, even if only for 1 minute (ideally 10+). Meditation builds focus, compassion, and peace. The Headspace app is great for beginners.

- Take improv classes. Businesses hire improv instructors for a reason: improv teaches key skills like presence, communication, and empathy. (If you don’t live near a class, consider Toastmasters.)

- To get better at healthy, proactive assertiveness, read “Difficult Conversations” and “Beyond Winning” (the chapter on the empathy-assertiveness tension).

- When facing an impulse (Reddit, gossip, mosquito bites, etc.), don’t give in reactively or ignore it; instead really pay attention to that sensation and “surf the urge.”

- Forgive yourself when you fail. It’s trite, but we’re most human when we fail. Self-empathy is necessary for honest acceptance and growth.

- Also, for productivity, Google search “5-Calendar Setup” for Google Calendar and “Don’t Drown in Email” for Gmail.

It's been fun sharing my soul with you guys. Feel free to get in touch if you feel inspired or have questions, or (especially) if you’re in Washington, DC and want to get a beer or go camping or cycling.

June 2015,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/06/06/on-shaky-ground/,"June 2015, 06",On shaky ground,"Dear listservians,I would like to tell you something about the area where I live. I live in the city of Groningen in the northern part of the Netherlands. Groningen is a medium-sized provincial city (200,000 inhabitants) and the capital of the province of Groningen. If you are visiting the Netherlands, travel to the North, it's definitely worth it. Groningen is a beautiful old city and the province has many small picturesque villages with ancient churches, famous organs, and a beautiful landscape. 

In our province a very large natural gas field was discovered in 1959. For decades, billions of cubic meters of natural gas was pumped by a joint venture between the Dutch state and Exxon and Shell (NAM). It has brought the Netherlands wealth, but Groningen remained the poorest region of the country. In the eighties the earth began to protest, when the first light earthquakes were felt. In subsequent years, the earth trembled more and more, and more intense. In 2013, this happened about 130 times. As a result, houses, farms, churches and schools increasingly get cracks and some buildings are beyond repair, which caused people to leave their residence. Residents are afraid for the moment that a real hard earthquake will demolish buildings. They can’t sell their houses and leave, because nobody wants to buy them.   Those responsible have denied for decades there is a link between earthquakes and gas extraction.  They have ridiculed scientists who claimed this. Now it can’t be denied any longer and the NAM is willing to compensate the damage. The company takes the view that people will take abuse of the possibility to get money, so they first want to make sure that the damage is caused by the tremors and not by poor maintenance. This causes lengthy procedures that drives people to despair. The government has long ignored the problems. The proceeds of the gas were too high and the safety of the people was not taken care of.  Slowly but surely this is changing and since last year there is more attention and money to tackle the problems. The gas extraction is slightly reduced.I hope that the proponents of shale gas fracking listen to this story, because there are many similarities. Especially emphasizing only the positive aspects of the gas extraction and playing down the disadvantages. This is what happened for years in Groningen. 

Having said this, I want to emphasize that Groningen is much more than an area with problems. We have much to be proud of and I (and with me many others) am living with a lot of fun here. Google Groningen and you'll see what I mean. Be welcome!

June 2015,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/06/05/musing-on-luck/,"June 2015, 05",musing on luck,"I joined the Listserve just over three years ago: 1,123 days, to be exact. The list currently has 23,888 subscribers. Given a few assumptions1, we can simply divide the two to arrive at a cumulative probability that I'd have won the list by now: less than 5%. I'm a lucky man! Of course, if you knew me personally, you'd have known that already.

How to justify that assertion of luck? Let's start with the basics: I'm white, male, American; born to a dentist and a programmer, money was never really a concern growing up. The funny thing about living an upper-middle-class life is that from the inside, it's entirely invisible. How else might people live2?

Luck: the very qualities which impeded me socially as I was growing up, the nerdiness and hyperliteracy, turned out to be beneficial when it came time to go to college. I had a tiger mom long before that term was invented, and all the stress and homework paid off when I had a long list of AP credits and a nice GPA as I applied. More luck: my first choice college really liked my SAT scores, so I got to attend a private university at state-school prices.

Luck: When planning my final year of college, I was a little ahead in my coursework, so I had a choice. I could either overload a bit more and graduate a semester early, or I could keep a normal course load plus something extra just for fun. I chose the latter, and got a year of Japanese study in. Why not? I was watching a lot of anime at the time. How was I to know that the opportunity would arise to become an English teacher in Japan? I didn’t even have to pay for the flight!

After a year, the owner of the school I was teaching at died. His inheritor planned to close the school; it hadn't been earning much. I'd have to find a new job. Bad luck! Or so it seemed. I'd always dreamt of flight, so on a whim I wrote the Army and asked if it was possible for a civilian of no particular qualifications to become a helicopter pilot. Turns out the answer is yes3!

If you want to exhibit luck, the Army is the place for it. I was assigned to the Medevac, the single ethically easiest part of the military. In Afghanistan, nobody in my entire brigade died! And of course, if the Army hadn't taken me to Germany, I would never have met my wife.

Suffice it to say, she's the biggest example of good luck in my unusually lucky life.

So what do you do when you have all this luck, when you honestly can become anything you want? I’ve just left the Army: I received the notice I'd won the Listserve minutes after I gave back my military ID. Now I'm starting my first business, writing computer games. My degree, a decade ago, was in Computer Science. It's time to use it! More than half of new businesses fail, of course, but a few strike it rich. I have high hopes.

 I’m feeling lucky.

I'm on Twitter and Flickr as coriolinus, for those interested.

June 2015,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/06/04/the-five-stages-of-winning-the-listserve/,"June 2015, 04",The Five Stages of Winning the Listserve,"The Five Stages of Winning the Listserve:

1) Shock: On one hand, you'll be impressed by the extremely low percent chance of this happening, and how lucky you are. Statistics are weird, man. On the other hand, don't even pretend like you haven't sat and thought about what you'd write to the Listserve masses. This stage may morph into Panic if you're the type who ignores your email over the weekend.

Example: Hey, I won! Look how cool I am. Holycrap,Igotthis30hoursago,andhavea48hourwindow.

2) Anger/Sadness: This stage largely revolves around the realization that you probably don't have that many life happenings that make for fantastic or breath taking stories. In addition, you'll come to realize that your life advice is likely cliche, and that most of us dream of doing amazing things but can't for some reason, living each day hopeful of what's around the corner and making the best of the situation. Also, you're probably not that witty.

Example: Today's accepted norms are yesterday's hazy horizons? It's alright to shoot for the stars, just make sure you have a landing procedure?

3) Inspiration: Eureka, you've done it. Remember that one time you did that one cool thing? You'll smile, thinking of it fondly, as you type out a glorious and detailed depiction, noting exactly how you felt and how it changed your life for the better.

Example: I went on a weekend long road trip to a beautiful ocean coastline 4 hours away in middle of nowhere Australia with two guys who I had known for 48 hours and didn't know their last names or have a working phone or know our destination. It was crazy.

4) Realism: The realization that you tend to skip Listserve submissions when they're too wordy.

Example: Almost skipping the email saying you won because you were feeling too lazy to read Listserve today.

5) Submission: Sending it in knowing that while you didn't change the world, you likely didn't hurt it either.

Example: people will forever know that somewhere in this great wide world is someone that thinks Cold War Kids is a great band, any drink with elderflower in it is amazing, and that people for the love of god should use their goddamn turn signal. Started from the mitten, now I'm here.

But for real, be the best version of you everyday, try something new as often as possible,  and remember that humor doesn't have to be at anyone's expense. Also, I really like cool stickers to put on my beer fridge, so hit me up if you wanna do some sort of swap, or if you've been dying to try out some new bar in Houston.

If it's anxiety then do something that breeds it inside you like promising a big project for someone you care for. If it's fear, and you don't freeze in times of stress, execute your big project on the side of a mountain. But most importantly, do something BIG for someone you care for.

After almost ten years working for nonprofits I can tell you that work, regardless of how many you help, will never be as important as the ones you love. It's also true you should work at your friendships. And no, networking event participation does not count.

Friendship is more than bringing a case of beer to the barbecue or standing as a Godparent and failing miserably to even attempt to fill the role. It's more than buying a gift to the wedding and dancing your face off at the reception. It's being present and contributing to your peoples lives. It's not just making them laugh but also making sure they know you will be there to make them smile when they're too weak to laugh. It's holding their hand through the divorce and helping them get back into the dating pool when they're ready.

If people only wanna hang but completely disappear when sh*t hits the fan and you consider them a friend. You are selling yourself short. Lower the emotional investment you are making into that person and fill that space doing something for a friend that showed up for you.

You can't force a caterpillar to butterfly any more than you can force an associate to become a friend. Life creates these conditions and we have no control over any of it.

Some people are meant to be associates and that's fine too. Invite them to the parties and barbecues and have drinks with them on their birthday and have great evening dinners together. But stop expecting more from people than they are willing to give. It's such a waste of time. And for the people who show up, do something BIG. They have earned it after all.

Since I've been out of the country for the past few years I have plans to execute my own personal friend appreciation week this Summer where I will dedicate myself to my friends for a full week, helping them out, sharing my big projects with them and overall showing that now that i'm back in town physically that I am back all those other ways friends are too. The vulnerability makes me anxious, but, hey, that's what drives me.

I click 'Strict Workflow', my favorite pomodoro timer extension. While it’s running, the pomodoro app blocks gmail, facebook and youtube. Ingenious, right? I love productivity apps.In fact, I love productivity tricks so much that my friends ask me for productivity advice.

There’s a new productivity app that uses binaural beats that I signed up for...what was it called? I don’t remember, so I open my email. The timer is running so I can’t open gmail because it's blocked. No worries - I simply switch to incognito window in chrome and open gmail there. I search for the activation notice in my email. Ah, it was called I open it up and try to start the music. It doesn’t work. I try different browsers and different buttons for about ten minutes before filing a support ticket.

As long as I have an incognito window open, I decide to check facebook. Staring me in the face is an opinion piece on the New York Times about why women wear heals. Ok, I’ll take that bait. I read it. Then I see a link to another article in Fashion and Style that sounds interesting, so I start reading without finishing the first article.The timer rings, reminding me of why I’m working already at 7:30am. I just wasted an entire pomodoro doing things besides writing that app. Facepalm.

I have trouble finishing things.Two years ago, I made a list of my unfinished projects. I hoped that seeing what I hadn’t finished would give me the kick in the pants that I needed to be more productive. The final list had over 100 projects on it. Rather than help me, reviewing this list discouraged me.Why did I start projects at all if I wasn’t going to finish them? Why wake up early, miss out on sleep, give up relationships, and then fail to finish?

I feel like I’ve been stuck in an uncreative slump ever since. I don’t want to start something that I won’t finish, so I don’t start it at all. This has been good for my relationships, and maybe even my job, but I feel like part of me is missing. As I keep rejecting the ideas as they pop into my head, they stop coming.The funny thing is that reading over the list of unfinished projects, I did eventually finish most of them. It just took me longer than it might have taken someone else. I finished the relevant parts of the Design Patterns book. I learned to play poker. I went through all of Lady Ada's tutorials.   It’s not that I don’t finish things, it’s that I finish them on my own timeline. I know that if I start washing the dishes this morning, I’ll finish them by tomorrow night (which is frustrating for my boyfriend). I wish that I wasn’t like this. I wish that I had better self-control and finished projects in four hours instead of four months. But according to modern science, ADHD cannot be cured. So for now, I’ll keep using my productivity apps to help me. Also, I’ll start lots of things and eventually I’ll finish them.

See, I finished this email :-)

Part II : What I want from you as a captive audience

I've been studying a dual degree in law and economics in Paris, decided to chose law over economics. I naturally went to business law, as most dual degree students do (banking & finance). Usually, people quit because of the heavy workload / repetitiveness of the job. I was actually ok with both, had issues finding a meaning though - I have a potential job offer waiting for that I pass the bar exam, and am considering whether I should go for it.

I'm planning to move to Human Rights / Criminal law. However, I have many stereotypes about people working in this area (I'm afraid they'd sometimes be more into ideology than actually fighting for their clients) - though I hope I'm wrong. Anyone in the listserve did this move (business law --> human rights law) before ? Or just work in human rights / criminal law ? If yes, please feel free to reach out and prove me wrong on my stereotypes.

I'd also love to work abroad as a lawyer. Options are limited as I've only studied French law. I've thought of international criminal litigation (ICC proceedings for instance), but I'm not even sure there's more than pro bono in this field. Anyone is making a living out of this or knows someone who is : please feel free to reach out.

May 2015,30,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/05/30/the-steal/,"May 2015, 30",The Steal,"When I was eight, my dad brought me to my first game at Fenway. As we zipped down the Mass Pike he gave me packs of 1999 Topps to open; getting a Nomar card had to be a sign of good things to come. Wake and his knuckler led the Sox to a win that day, and I was hooked.Over the next few years I watched Pedro dominate, Nomar flirt with .400, and Trot’s helmet grow ever dirtier. Aaron Boone gave me my first-ever heartbreak. But it wasn't until the fall of 2004 that the game would truly make its mark on my life.

On September 11, 2004, my dad unexpectedly left. The reasons were tied up in alcohol; the details I won’t expose here.

It took a while to hit me, and I remember the exact moment that it did. About two weeks later, the Red Sox were beating the rival Yankees 11-4. Curt Schilling, my favorite player at the time, had been solid and the offense had exploded. Excited, I called my dad’s cell to ask him if he was watching. The phone rang and went to voicemail. I tried again. Nothing. I tried again. And again, and again…

He was gone.

In this moment, I was crippled. That my favorite baseball team had won suddenly seemed inconsequential and stupid compared to my life.

As a coping mechanism I retreated deep into my own mind. I didn't stop talking or anything like that, but as I was told afterwards, any subject even slightly emotional would bring me to a complete stop. During this period, my brain deleted – actually deleted, not hid – large chunks of memories related to my dad, I suppose as a way to numb the pain they elicited.

In this state of existence, I devoted myself to the largely non-emotional: schoolwork, more schoolwork, and, of course, baseball. In October of that year the Red Sox were in the playoffs. I’ll set the scene for those who don’t know it: they are facing the hated Yankees in the American League Championship Series and they haven’t won a title in 86 years. It’s a best-of-seven series, and Boston has lost the first three games. No team in history has ever come back from such a deficit.

In the ninth inning, the Sox are down one with the great Yankee Mariano Rivera pitching. Speedster Dave Roberts is on first base. Everyone in the world knows he is trying to steal second.

He goes.

Safe!

He scores later in the inning; they go on to win the series in dramatic fashion, and then the World Series. And while I didn't realize it at the time, that improbable comeback triggered something. I believe the perseverance of that team gave me a profound sense of hope that began lifting me out of my shell. It wasn't the only factor, it wasn't quick, and it wasn't easy. But here I am today, free of the pain that might have consumed me.

People always talk about how baseball bringing people together in dire times: President Bush throwing out the first pitch after 9/11, Ortiz’s impromptu speech after the marathon bombing, etc. But what about its power to bring an individual together?

Objectively, it was a man I don’t know running from one place to another before a ball got there. But even today, more than a decade later, I cannot watch a clip of that steal without crying. It is an integral part of me.

To see the play, search “the steal” on YouTube. I’m happy that it’s the first result.

Go Sox!

It seems that karma / chance aligned for me to share with you guysabout an experience that happened this May Day. I went to this museumcalled Dialogue in the Dark in Hamburg, Germany. Here, ""visitors areled by blind guides through a specially constructed and completelydarkened space. Conveying characteristics of a familiar environmentsuch as a park, a street or a bar, a daily routine turns into a newexperience."" This was not my idea but I have always been open tounderstand different lives. I went with 8 other people in a groupwho I just met that very day; it was a trust building experience withthem as well as with our guide. I just started learning German so ourgroup had an English-speaking guide, who went by the name Ray. He""showed"" us his ""car,"" which we had to guess the brand; his ""door,""where we had to find the doorbell; as well as his ""boat,"" allsimulated in the dark.

In the end we chatted at the “cafe."" He helped us identifying thecoins and paying for the drinks and snacks. He could see 7%, hastraveled overseas, and enjoys Chinese martial art films. He isenrolled in university and uses learning aid (I have seen a couple ofvisually impaired students guided only by walking sticks at my own unicampus as well). At one point he said that his parents were Turkish.This struck me that I was assuming he was German all the time and itrevealed a lot about the differences in epistemology. So I asked howdo visually impaired people judge others if they cannot see theirappearances. Ray said that people like him usually respond positivelyto sounds that are warm and enthusiastic, which was exactly his kindof speech.

When it was time to say goodbye, I asked if we could see what helooked like. Ray joked that if we see anyone who looks like JohnnyDepp it would be him. But in the end he wanted us to remember him as ablind person would remember a new person, and we did not see him. Ishook hands with him instead.I looked up his full name ""Rasim"" means the one who draws. It remindsme of this visually impaired artist John Bramblitt who paintedextraordinary paintings with the help of other senses.

I expected to understand the experience of the blind and visuallyimpaired. As a student of social sciences, we work with categories,such as class or race. The same applied for people with disabilities.But this experience showed that people are not defined exclusively bytheir most salient feature. It is a cliche to list the achievementsthat blind people have accomplished, but after this time, I realizedthat it is so true that one should not judge anyone based on theirdisability. After spending 90 min in the dark with simulatedenvironments and a walking stick, I understood myself better. I amthat I am. Even visual disability cannot change certain aspects ofmyself. This is not to say that gender, class, and race does notmatter--Being from an educated family helps. I could imagine sexualassault would also be more of an issue for women-identifying visualimpaired than the men. (See film ""Night on Earth"") Still, disabilityis only one aspect and does not decide one's life once and for all.

More about me: I am a student studying Indian history, which isabsolutely fascinating. I am going to India in July for exchange.

I tallied up the hours spent in a cramped room with a laptop surrounded by people doing the same. If my job’s based on 160-hour months, then so far this year I’ve worked through June. It was 8 pm. I almost fell asleep in the elevator. This is leading to something. I'm counting all this time spent 26 floors up as time spent with my head scraping the sky. I have to.

2.My last cigarette ever was in the Mojave desert, bathing in moonlight halfway up the Kelso Dunes with a Mag-Lite and a bottle of scotch. I felt small, quiet, so I promised to myself that I’d reach the summit someday when I’m not off an overnight Vegas bender, with proper gear and a lung cleaner of tar. That was New Year's.

3.I could never see myself living in New York. I’ve got so many ghosts in New York. Hell, everyone’s got ghosts in New York. Chicago’s a smaller, cleaner take on that city, brutally cold but with humble Midwestern charm. The spring may thaw, but this winter softened me. I like falling asleep to the gradients of purple and white the sky paints on my windows.

4.Years ago at a café called Antidote, I sat in stilted silence and felt heartbeats trickle through the floorboards. On the table next to me was a small wooden box. It’s there right now, it’s gotta be. In it was a scrap of paper with a Khalil Gibran quote that's still sticky in the back of my memory: “…Ever has it been known that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.”

5.I’m a copywriter. I was even featured on Modern Copywriter, but a year or so removed now I wonder how much of that was a crock. I write a lot for social media. I goad myself into calling what I do “commercial art”, that the kind of writing I'm burning out on is poetry. The distillation of a single idea to its barest bones. But I’m not a poet, not like that, not anymore.

6.Mental illness has me convinced I'm living a massive prank. Whenever I have too much red wine or more often, when I don’t, I live as a wound spring. Teetering, waiting until my ears start ringing. Waiting to wrestle with my darker corners. But I'm better than them. I can love until loving grows ragged. Until rain tears down sewers, until the front door goes creaky. I can care.

7.The odd, misshapen hollowness pulling at me will fill. I’m someone who hurts weary, listless. I’m typing this sitting on my couch in my underwear with soapy fingertips. If only I were a praying man.

***

Some letters I’ll dedicate this email to: J for introducing me to The Listserve, A for pushing me to keep creating, V for being my art director and somehow tolerating this nonsense.

Still can't believe I won the Listserve. Considering I also beat the odds of the H1-B visa lottery (look it up and tell me it's not massively fucked) a few weeks ago, maybe I should buy some scratch-offs.

I’m @ananter on most social media. Look me up and say hello, that’d be really nice. If you like my writing, there's more at arbitrarynumbers (dot) com. Thanks for reading.

May 2015,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/05/24/on-living-a-queer-werido-life/,"May 2015, 24",On living a queer werido life.,"I spent most of my life believing that if you were gay, you must have known it from a young age. Most of the coming-out stories I had heard involved always feeling different and just knowing that you were, most definitely, not straight. I believed this until about three years ago.

Three years ago, I found myself in a social group of mostly gay women and whenever I was asked if I was gay, I said no. This was not a lie. I have self identified as straight my whole life…I’ve had crushes on boys since I was in elementary school and I’ve had many dates, boyfriends, lovers, etc. Maybe it didn’t always work out and maybe I didn’t find ‘the one’, but I loved men and I never had a crush on a girl…so I was straight, obviously. Right?  Well, no, not exactly.

When I first met her, I just couldn’t stop staring. Soon we started talking and I felt compelled to always be near her. Anytime we were in a group of friends, I had to stand near her. It felt almost subconscious, this desire to be around her. I couldn’t form thoughts or words to explain it. Then one day she took my hand and that was pretty much it. It was unlike anything else I had ever felt. We’ve been together since that day.

In between the sighs and swoons of those first few months, I kept thinking ‘how did i not know that i was gay? how do you get to 32 and not know? am i so clueless about who i am???’. It was  a real struggle to figure out how I wanted to identify. It was a crisis of self way after I thought those things were over. I didn’t feel gay or straight or bi or anything really.  I read that bisexual women have a higher rate of anxiety and depression than straight or gay women and I can completely understand why.

Why am I telling all of you this? Because it’s hard to not fit. It’s hard to not feel like you are like everyone else. Your struggle isn’t exactly like mine and mine isn’t like yours, but we’ve all got one.  Everyones’ struggle is real.

I don’t wonder quite so much about what i want to call myself these days. I really just feel like a queer person. Most specifically a queer weirdo and I feel good about that one.

I would love to hear from anyone that feels like a queer weirdo! Let’s talk/type at each other and then maybe send some postcards or other real-life mail. Bonus if you’d like to talk about Uhh Yeah Dude, immunohematology, Ru Paul’s Drag Race, Bob Dylan, button-making, Mix-tapes, or Twin Peaks.

Do me a favor. Take a minute and think of everything good in your life. You are blessed beyond measure when you count the simple things.

1. (A little about me)I was born and raised in Northwest Indiana. I recently graduated from Purdue with a full scholarship, a Bachelor’s of Science in Business Management, excessive experience and a dream of being a CEO since I knew what one was. I want this because I want to change the world for the better and impact a multitude of lives.

2. (Something that I’m passionate about)I have a deep fascination and love for solar technology. I hope to one day create a thermostat-like device that measures the solar footprint of a house/building and allocates energy from solar panels my company has installed in effective locations. My company would then buy the excess output and allocate it to those that need greater amounts of energy. I would also like to target the automotive industry. Electric cars are not reasonable to many because they cannot go long distances. My dream is to install a solar grid on all highways that transports captured energy to the car via some sort of “power grid.” Something also needs to be done with those grass patches in and around highways! Do I have all the answers? No. Do I dream about a world existing without the dependence of fossil fuels? Constantly. Our planet has given us so much and it is time for those who think outside the boxes and lines established by our forefathers to go out and change the world.

3. (Something you should definitely check out)1. Some look up to celebrities or athletes. I look up to Elizabeth Holmes, CEO and founder of Theranos an incredible company that will likely revolutionize the way blood testing is done and the healthcare industry functions.

2. Spencer Antle founded the Island Company. It encompasses the idea of turning a passion into a career. I would move to the ends of the Earth to work for this company.

4. (Something you should read if you don’t read anything else)I hope someone told you hello, asked how your day was, and smiled at you. Seriously, happiness cultivates happiness. If you can’t be anything else, manifest what makes you happy and add more of it to your life.Google the article, “Why I gave up a 95k job to move to an island and scoop ice cream”

Do you live in and around Chicago? Do you have recommendations or advice for a girl whose ready for a full-time job and wants to be a CEO one day?Do you love education, reading, the Art Institute, monograms, summer, the color blue, or traveling? Do you just want to chat?

Please email me! I would be honored to hear from you and feel so blessed to have had the opportunity to share my take on this crazy, beautiful life with you.

A year ago my husband and I just popped down to the Chicago courthouse and said our “I Do’s.” But was that’s it, we didn’t share it with everyone else, I didn’t tell my coworkers or friends or family.  We don’t pick out colors, menus or spend $60,000 on a wedding.  We don’t wear rings, but at home he’s my husband. It’s our marriage.  And it’s turned out quite nice.  But it did not start that way.

See my boyfriend is an immigrate, which has left our lives limited in many ways.   We were backed into a corner by the government, if we wanted to continue date we needed to get married or he would have to leave the country. So many people face situations like this in their lives.  A shit or get off the pot moment.  This was mine. We had been dating and living together and knew that marriage would be down the road but we did not feel ready to “be married.” So we filed our marriage license and deepened our commitment to each other.

It’s been a stressful year, dealing with the immigration processes and as an American citizen, it’s been an eye opening experience. The process is HARD, complicated and a lot of work!  I’ve spent hundreds of hours of my life filling out paperwork and submitting forms, just to have them rejected and doing it all again.  For anyone else that is going through this process, I would recommend hiring a lawyer. I was very anti-lawyer in the beginning.  I wanted us to complete everything together because I felt it was really important for him to take an active role in his journey towards becoming a US citizen.  We had a wonderful sense of pride and accomplishment finishing the paper ourselves.  But with that being said it’s worth the money to have a knowledgeable legal professional there for you.

We took the leap.  It was not perfect and it was never how I expected my life to be but they were the cards in fount of me.  And I played my hand. Our relationship has only gotten better and I’m hopeful for our future. We fill our lives with love and supportiveness.  And in our own time and on our own terms we are going to have that wedding with all of our friends and family there to cheer us on (the government will not be invited).

Write me if you have a secret you would like to share with me.

Thank you to my dear friend Watson for introducing me to Listserve, she’s a wonderful beautiful women who has manager to channel her strength in the last two years and take her own leaps of faith.  I miss you. And congrats on the new house.

I love to read, if you have not checked out Goodreads, I would highly recommend it.

I find myself pretty jaded and cynical about the listserv emails. The advice and life's lessons that get bandied about are often naive, under-informed, or one-sided. You can't really start your life until you've backpacked across Tanzania on a kangaroo's back. How did that kangaroo get to Tanzania? It swam. Obviously.

TV likes to talk about midlife crises a lot. Or at least it did in the 80s and 90s, when we didn't have amazing prestige television. I'm almost 37, which is ancient to many of you, young to a few. For me, it's definitely not a midlife crisis, it's more of a midlife malaise. I'm solidly living the American middle class dream, such as it is. But I still really don't know what to do with my life. I'm clearly in no place to give you life advice. The things I know I should do, but probably won't: Exercise more. Drink less. Be more patient with my kids. Stop procrastinating.

If you're looking to procrastinate, however, I'm going to suggest some animated shows. Most of the TV my kids watch is garbage, but occasionally they come across some gems. My favorites are Phineas and Ferb, Gravity Falls, and Adventure Time. They're funny and clever, and actually have some depth to them. 

That's all I got. Seems like a wasted opportunity to address a semi-captive audience, but so be it.

My dad said something in particular that sparked the “aha” moment in me. He said, “What is it that you think about before you fall asleep?”

A little about me. I’m 23, born + raised in Vancouver, Canada. I spent about 3 years in Montreal, Quebec - living, working, learning French. A year after I graduated high school, 2011, my parents bought me a ticket to Montreal to visit a friend, who was studying @ McGill. I instantly fell in love with the city (middle of February in Eastern Canada, mind you). I expressed an interest in revisiting the city to my mother and brother. On my way to the airport, with 4% battery life on my phone, my brother calls me up and tells me: “If you like it over there so much, why don’t you stay? I’ll throw you $250 tonight if you don’t board your flight. I’ll even pay for your first months rent. Then you’re on you’re own.” I didn’t even have enough money to pay for the cab. I didn't even have enough time to think it through. I skipped my flight anyway.

The best years of my life, thus far, were spent in Montreal. And I’m not talking about fun times, camaraderie and drunken bullshit (although that played a part). I’m talking consistent challenge. Always on your toes. Work at your most efficient. Challenge others. Learning another language is difficult, especially in a city where lack of knowledge of said language is a burden before you can even recognize it to be so. Humility plays a huge part in it all. So does perseverance. And pride, unfortunately.

Side note - I feel my entire life, I’ve flip flopped between the need to chase the American Dream and living a solitary life, making an honest living without much care for where I stand in social circles. Across the board I can tell you that I feel the need to contribute in some substantial way to current culture.

I’d like to ask you all: what you think about before you fall asleep?

A quick story about my childhood - there's no advice or anything in it, I promise. I mean I think diva cups are probably a good idea too, and you should good will hunting the duck out of your carpe diem you kings of Maine, but that’s getting really boring.

This is about the biggest decision I ever had to make.  I had a great job with a great company making great money and I left all that to become a “tugboat captain” This is the story of that journey...

The day before I decided to give up being a sysadmin for BuzzFeed started as one of the best days of my life.  It began with a pod of dolphins and a few shrimp boats on the horizon & ended with the most amazing fireworks show in the sky. I laid on the deck of my tug staring into the heavens identifying constellations & watching shooting stars for hours.

Tonight was different. I wasn’t yet comfortable enough with my tug to fully trust it. More accurately, I wasn’t comfortable with my ability to handle her under load. Not at night. Not with wind this strong.

Tonight’s sunset was as beautiful as any I’ve ever seen, but when the stars disappeared and the wind picked up, I knew I was in for a long night. Soon the lightning appeared and the waves grew.

By 1am my motor was struggling to keep the boat pointed in the right direction. Every time a wave lifted the back of the boat, the motor would lose contact with the water and scream the most mind jarring scream you’ve ever heard. It would float in the air for what seemed like minutes before another wave would pick up the front of the boat and the motor would again find traction below the surface.when I realized that there was only one thing to do, so I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and there was a dice in the mirror, if anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought ""nah forget it, Yo homes for Bel-Air!"" I pulled, up to a house about 7 or 8 and i yelled to the cabby ""yo homes smell ya later"" looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, to sit on my throne, as the prince of Bel-Air!

First, some background. Most people I know (at least those who live in the US) never give a moment’s thought about their access to a basic resource: clean water. For them, it’s abundant, cheap, and safe to drink.

That’s not the case in many other parts of the world. Millions of people do NOT have a reliable source of safe water, despite charities and foundations spending huge sums attempting to solve this problem. When their solutions don’t work, there’s often a common cause: they may be based on technology that is inappropriate or unsustainable outside the developed world, and they often ignore or don’t understand the social and economic context in which they’re going to be used. Thus, a new well and pump may provide water to a village for a while, until the pump breaks, and nobody is responsible for fixing it, and nobody knows how or has access to the parts and tools they would need.

Under these circumstances, solutions that work have some common characteristics: the technology is relatively simple and cheap to build, use and maintain. But more importantly, there’s a social and economic structure to support it.

Here’s a great example of that kind of technology: biosand water filters. They’re simple, yet clever, in design, using mostly concrete, gravel and sand. They are a proven, effective way to help solve the problem of providing sustainable, affordable access to clean, safe water. If you google the term, or go to the Wikipedia article about them, you’ll get a basic idea of how they work. The technology has been adopted in many parts of the developing world, but the technology by itself is not enough.

Here’s the success story you never heard of: Haiti is the most impoverished country in the Western hemisphere, and reliable access to all of the resources that people in the developed world take for granted (safe shelter, healthy food, medical care, and clean water) are beyond the reach of much of its population. The problems are deeply systemic, but a great place to start solving them is to support access to clean water. This is a prerequisite to health, which in turn is a prerequisite to being educated and employable. Many organizations in Haiti have been working on this cluster of problems, but one in particular has had remarkable success for nearly 15 years: Clean Water for Haiti (google that phrase, and they’re the first non-ad driven result). They have delivered nearly 20,000 filters, developed improvements to the design, and most importantly, created programs that help make sure the filters are used properly and stay in use. This has improved the lives, and literally saved the lives, of many thousands of Haitians. And there’s a side benefit of providing employment to local people who make and deliver the filters. To me, that’s a real success story.

Today was one of those days. I woke up in a good mood only to have it momentarily crushed when I arrived to work and my Mac died. Two and a half years of work suddenly gone (well not technically, but you catch my drift). After finally giving up and letting it be, I check my email and found out I wont the listserve. I am never one to win lotteries, sweepstakes, or anything where luck is involved; clearly I was elated.

I thought that I would always know what to say if I ever did win. I probably had it all typed out and here I am looking at the screen trying to figure out what to say to 20K subscribers. Here's a little insight to my life currently:

The day before starting my second part-time job as a waitress (hey, Brokelyn is expensive), my boyfriend of four years and I broke up. It's a song and dance we've been doing since the beginning of our relationship but I have no hopes or desires to continue it again. I'm emotionally wiped out. The love I have for him will always be there, but I wouldn't mind it if I never had to see his face again. Everyone around me says I am dealing with it gracefully and I have to thank the universe for placing new people and opportunities in my life to keep my mind off things.

It's May, which doesn't mean much, unless you are a home seamstress. “Me-Made-May” is a month where we try our best to wear something we've made each day for the entire month. If you're curious as to what I've been making you can find me via ig search. I became a seamstress because at the age of 5 I always knew I wanted to be a designer. My parents called me stubborn but I like to think of it as determined. Not once in the next 25 years have I changed my mind. It’s pretty freaking amazing to take two dimensional pieces of fabric and fit them together like a puzzle to create wearable art. Most importantly, I became a seamstress because I didn't want to contribute to the cycle of fast fashion and the unfair wages and living conditions of clothing factory workers.

It's May, which doesn't mean much, unless you are counting down the days to the Movement Festival in Detroit. If you are reading this and are planning on going, message me. I always love meeting up with like-minded people.

Lastly, if you've made it this far... all life matters. Even the ones you think are not worth saving... even the ones who think their life is not worth saving. Sometimes the best way to show support and solidarity is to sit down, shut up, and listen. I don't have words of encouragement or life advice, I feel like every other email I've read included those... but tip your waitress/bartender when they’ve given you good service. The urban legend is true; we always remember you.

If you're in New York, reach out. I love getting to know new people.

I have always had this thought in my mind, there is no better place to validate it than Listserve, here it goes.

Is everyone good in this world?

Right from childhood, we always categorize people into two groups, the good guys, the bad guys and you. People whom we like are good and they are presumed to have good deeds and there is this bad people. Let us say, you become friends with one of those bad guys, then you realize that they are not bad, they have reasons behind their actions and they seems good to you now. I have wondered, what if we get to know every bad person, then will they all look good to you after you become their friends?

How come we never label the people whom we know as bad or how come our vision changes when we know them. Does that mean everyone in this world is good and it is only our perception?

Take Fast and Furious movie for example, (if you have not seen that, then take any movie/book where the protagonist is a bad guy, who steals/robs/kills etc). How do we want those protagonist to win, when a police chase happens, how come we want the bad guys to escape. 

I am not talking about moral dilemma here, but I wonder how things change when we look it from a different angle. If everyone is good to someone, why is this world like this?

One thought:No one is below you in this world and likewise no one is above you as well. Everyone is same, including you.

In 30 days, I'm moving from NYC to Boston, which isn't that big of a deal geographically speaking. But it's unusual because I made this decision on my own which is rare for humans today. I'm taking my job with me, because I can. I'm not moving for a guy-- as so many of my peers assume.

As soon as I made the decision to do this, it all started to fall into place. So it’s par for the course I won the listserve right now.

1.   Today alone, on my way into work I saw a cat on a leash and a woman rollerblading into a Home Depot. All before 9:30am: only in NYC.

2.   When I was about 8 years old, the 'bad boy' in elementary school went around asking all the girls if they were 'still virgins'... and the thing is, I thought a 'virgin' and a 'vegetarian' were the same thing... so when I shouted 'NO' back because I REALLY love cheeseburgers, things got a little weird. Make sure you're listening.

3.   I'm the oldest of 5 kids and 4 of us are girls, and before you say 'oh your poor brother' please know he is 'the one true king.' Growing up, we teased him a lot about girls. When he was 7, he said he didn’t 'like' the girl I accused him of 'liking' because she was 'stupid and ugly' and my littlest sister, all of 4 years old, said: 'you can't be stupid AND ugly, you're one or the other! No one has that much bad luck!' Thank God for that.

4.   I was born with this gigantic magnet on my forehead that emits an energy to strangers that want to tell me secrets about their life. At any given moment, a random person will tell me a random story. The last time this happened, I ran into a yoga teacher  I hadn't seen in 6 months. I said '____! How are you ?!?!' She said 'Bethany, I'm just so constipated.' Maybe if you tell a stranger a random story, it will make their day, or, they will make fun of you.

5.   I hesitated in sharing this idea I have but it's Friday and WTF. I feel like someone should make a movie about getting Bill Murray to be in your movie because apparently it's not only very hard but possibly hysterical. There should also be a sub story about Bill Murray trying to help save Rob Kardashian from the rest of the Klan because whatever they are doing isn't working for Rob. Help people, in any way you can.

6.   I always remind myself 'You only need 20 seconds of insane courage, embarrassing bravery, and something great will happen.' This is gotten me into a lot of trouble. But has also made me (believe I am) very smart. Think about something you want, make a move towards it and count to 20. That gut wrenching feeling within? It will go away. Nothing is forever.

7.   While I literally never thought the Beibs and I would have anything in common other than we both have eyeballs and some tattoos; it was announced on his Comedy Central Roast, that his favorite comedian is Chris D' Elia. It turns out, Chris is super funny! So thanks to the Beibs, I found something/someone cool and funny. So got something to say (re: #4)? Have some funny clips or note to pass along?!  (re:#7) Send them over!

May 2015,14,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/05/14/morning-after/,"May 2015, 14",Morning After,"[TW: Sexual assault]

Almost exactly one year ago, a show I wrote and directed, called Morning After, opened at my college. The play is about sexual assault on college campuses, and it was inspired by my own rape in the fall of 2012. In honor of the show’s anniversary, I went back and reread everything I could find from the production process. One of the things I uncovered was my director’s note, and I want to share part of it with you all here:

“Morning After is my reaction to a national dialogue that too often focuses on the act of violence itself rather than the aftermath. It is a response to the numerous plays I read that depicted sexual assault survivors as broken and defeated rather than working to feel better.  It is my challenge to a culture that continues to blame victims instead of the perpetrators, and that shames survivors into silence. Most of all, it is my attempt to do what I previously thought was impossible: turning a traumatic experience into a personal triumph.

An important person in my life once told me that love is when a person or thing becomes a part of us, when one can no longer be fully understood without the other. In the years since, I have never forgotten his words, and I can finally say with certainty that he was right. I do not love or forgive the man who assaulted me, but I love this show, the way I found to heal. I love the countless people who helped shape my vision into the performance you see today. I love the women who trust me enough to get onstage and bring my words to life. I know that a piece of me is in every aspect of Morning After, just as I’m sure that this show is now a part of me.”

It’s hard to know which experiences will change us, for the better or for the worse. I was always someone who needed to know what would happen next. Forget just having a 5 year plan- I had a 5 day plan and a 5 week plan and a 5 month plan. But being raped wasn’t something I could plan for. My need to process and react through theater wasn’t something I could plan for. And the new path I’ve found myself on certainly wasn’t something I could plan for.

In the year since the show opened, I graduated from college and moved to New York, where I started volunteering as a rape crisis counselor. I just left my job in advertising, the career I thought I wanted all through college, for a more flexible job so I can focus on activism. I made the decision to go to law school to help survivors navigate the legal system, even though I never really saw myself as a lawyer before. I am the woman who can be found explaining consent culture at parties, the loud mouth who is no longer afraid of seeming too angry or too emotional or too biased. On one level it bothers me that it was an assault that set me on this road, but I can’t argue with where I am. The work I’ve found myself doing is hard and upsetting and incredibly rewarding, and I wouldn’t change anything about the woman I’ve become.

I haven’t made a new plan yet. I realized that it’s sort of worthless. I mean, it’s gonna change anyway, right? So I’ll just be here doing what I think is important right now, waiting for my next Morning After to come along.

When you choose a partner, you have to make compromises and sacrifices, but it’s a price you pay.  Do I want to follow my every whim and desire as I make my way through space and time? Absolutely.  But at the end of the day, do I need someone when I’m doubting myself and I’m insecure and my heart’s failing me?  Do I need someone, who, when the heat gets hot, has my back?”

“So…do you?”

“I do.”

Here we are again, although I have never written in this exact setting.

                We are both right here, so close, but also incredibly far away.  As far as you are concerned, I’m probably not even here.  I don’t know why I continue to try, but here I am anyways.  Because, I continue to be an idiot.  I’ll keep on living with the false hopes of someday requiting this unrequited crush.  And deep down, I know it’s foolish.  That I keep glancing and hoping that this time it’ll be different, while you are possibly oblivious and texting someone else.  Laughing at things I don’t understand, never realizing that all I want is your attention.  That all I want is for you to ask about my day and tell me stupid stuff about your life and not force me to do all of the asking.  That all I want is you.

                That’s dumb though, right?  See, my conclusion—I am an idiot.  Err, I guess that wasn’t a conclusion, it’s more like the thesis.  I prefer to think of myself as a hopeless realist though.  Or maybe, realistically hopeless.  I know I’m wrong, but I still can’t talk myself out of it.  Because occasionally, you’ll give some small hint that maybe it’s different this time.  An almost dead ember on a piece of dried wood.  No wait, that’s not quite right.  That would suggest that there was once a fire.  Instead, it’s more like there was a fire over there, and it’s basically out, but here I am, all the way over here.  And like, it hasn’t rained in a super long time, so like just the tiniest spark or flicker or even a strong magnifying glass, will set everything ablaze.  But I have to continuously carry around a massive 5 gallon bucket of water, because I can’t just start a fire based on false subliminal messages and misconstrued suggestions propagated by an overactive imagination.  Fires should be shared by two people, and it just won’t do to have one on your own.  It’s not safe, someone will almost certainly get hurt, and there is no one to reign in the other side.  Before I know it, it’s out of control, but no one realizes that I am in danger of breaking my own heart once again.  Because I snuck off into the woods on my own, following a trail that never truly existed and thought, here, I’m ready for you—you will be the one that changes everything.  You are the one that might’ve known the direction, but you don’t have a trail map, or a compass, and you’ve never even really looked at the stars.

This smoke signal never had a chance, thanks to the cascade of cold feelings poured all over it, and I didn’t think to leave a trail just in case.  I’ve become so accustomed to never being a choice that I wandered on my own knowing quite well that I would never be found.  There’s no one that wants to find me.

Can’t believe I actually won the listserve!

I’m a 22 yo marketer who moved to San Francisco last year.  Startup culture is pretty amazing, but I think sometimes we get so wrapped up in ourselves that we miss the bigger picture.

Here are some of my ideas on running a great startup:

1. Make a 10x improvement.  The world doesn’t need another messaging app.  Sure, messaging apps like FB Messenger, Line, and WhatsApp are the craze of the moment, but I’d much rather start something like Theranos (their lab technology could save the US healthcare system ~$200 billion over 10 years).

2. Always put people first.  Both for customers and employees, putting people first might be more expensive in the short-term, but it always pays off in the long run. It’s easy to focus on the numbers, but invest the time to build a humble, transparent company culture.

3. Don’t be mediocre. Lots of companies can build pretty decent products, but the really epic experiences are fairly rare.  I recently had a problem with my GoRuck backpack, and they immediately sent me a brand new backpack under their lifetime guarantee (more than two years after I first purchased!).

4. Find a way to make money.  Too many startups take a loss for years and run off venture capitalist investments.  Sometimes that’s necessary (like if you need a large infrastructure), but cash flow is quite freeing.

Also, I’m a bit of a book geek, so I’d love to hear your favorite books! (My favorite lately was Red Notice by Bill Browder)

Each time I thought I would write something long and touching. Not necessarily profound, but maybe a story or a piece of writing I have locked away on my computer. I used to be a writer, or at least I wanted to be. Now it feels like a life I never lived.

But, of course, I win the lottery at the worst time, the busiest time of my life. For the past two years I have been planning and building a restaurant. By no means should it have taken this long, but it has. The lottery win didn’t come two years ago, a year ago, or even last week when I was waiting for construction to end. No, it has come today, when construction is finally complete, and I have finally passed all three required inspections. It means that I can announce my Grand Opening date today. It means that I have so much more work to do.

So I part with an invitation to my Grand Opening event. If you live in the Bay Area and love fantastic chocolate cakes, stop by The Prolific Oven in downtown Sunnyvale on Tuesday, May 12th. We’ll be giving away free cake!

I must admit I don’t read every Listserve email, and I haven’t enjoyed reading all the ones I have read. But every once in a while an email will touch me in a way that I never thought an email – words on my screen – from a strange, no less – could. So, thanks Alvin Chang, my friend and co-founder of The Listserve, for creating something cool. You’re amazing!

May 2015,10,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/05/10/why-i-run/,"May 2015, 10",Why I Run,"One Saturday last summer, I had a stretch of Fifth Avenue in New York City all to myself. It was the day of my favorite race, the Fifth Avenue Mile, where runners sprint from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to Grand Army Plaza.            Since I was training for a marathon and had to run 12 more miles that day, I decided to go easy. I wasn’t going to race. I positioned myself at the very back of the field, knowing that everyone else was going to go out hard. After a block, I was completely by myself.As I ran, I watched all of the other runners get farther and farther away. I wondered, what did the spectators and other runners think of me, falling back so quickly, going so slowly? Did anyone think that I simply wasn’t capable of running faster? Did I look fat? Were people wondering why I signed up for this race at all?Then I noticed another runner on the west side of Fifth Avenue. He ran slowly, hunched over, using a walker to help him balance. A woman was walking alongside him, talking, but he was completely ignoring anything she was saying. I recognized the hard, stubborn look on his face. Focused, determined, fully concentrated on each step toward the finish line. I recognized it as the same look I have in all of my marathon photos.I began to cry.I remembered how I felt finishing my first mile back in 2010. It was something I didn’t think I could do—until I gave in to the repetitive footfalls. I keep moving forward, one foot after the other until the app on my phone signaled I had run a mile. I remember it took thirteen minutes and eleven seconds. I felt like I could keep going forever. I had the same feeling during the New York City Marathon in 2013—that I could just go and go and go, fueled by sheer determination and faith. I knew exactly what that stranger on Fifth Avenue was thinking, even though our lives seemed very different.In these moments (and so many others), I’m reminded why I run. No matter how many races you finish or how fast you are, all runners share common ground. My husband and I recently moved to San Francisco, where we don’t know many people. As adults, it’s been slow and awkward making friends. But I’ve made a few, mostly through running groups. Yesterday, I participated in a group track workout with a new friend who just started running. After a tough sprint she said, “I’m not sure I’m ever going to love this, but I’m trying.”I recognized myself instantly. I didn’t know how to tell her about the feeling I have when the footfalls take over and running isn’t difficult anymore. I didn’t know how to describe the sense of love and unity that comes from a pack of people you don’t know providing encouragement at the exact moment you need it to finish your first marathon. I didn’t know how to tell her about what happened to me on Fifth Avenue, when I suddenly recognized myself in someone else so clearly that it brought me to tears.And I really didn’t want to seem weird. So I found myself instead saying words that had been said to me when I first began. “Just wait. You’ll find it.”I want to give a special shoutout, thanking the San Francisco Road Runners and Run 365 for being so friendly and open to a newcomer.

My life took a complete change for the better when I took matters into my own hands. I was always a bright kid and at the insistence of my parents I went to the university, put myself in debt, and got a BA in a field that I wasn't too crazy about, Psychology. Had it been up to me, I would've studied art.

After I graduated I was burnt out from school and I knew I didn't want to pursue Psychology any further. So I did what any other angsty, passionate twenty-something year old does and ran away into the wilderness. Yeah, actually, what I did was I picked up a seasonal job and spent the next five months living, working, and exploring in Yosemite National Park. To say it rejuvenated my spirit is a complete understatement, I not only had a national park as my playgrounds and backyard, I was in YOSEMITE. I was hiking, having a great time, and taking photographs of my adventures along the way and the scenic landscapes. I even made a small book for friends and family of my time there.

After my stint there was done, I knew there was no way I could return to the desert wasteland that is the Inland Empire, CA. My soul was on fire and needed to be stoked. So I followed the rest of the transients, packed up all my belongings in my car, and drove up the coast (a worthy endeavor everyone should try at least once), did my first solo camping expedition in Big Sur, and moved to Portland, OR. I met some of the kindest, greatest people I have ever met and some incredible friends I intend to keep for life (including the one who introduced me to the listserve, HI CASEY, LUV YEW!) as well as the love of my life, but that's a completely other heartwarming story. I loved Portland with my entire being, but after spending half a year in the wilderness I was restless for more than sleepy little Portland had to offer, no matter how good it was for me. The job market was awful and I was stuck working a job I hated, so at the insistence of a good friend I moved to Seattle not even having spent a full year in Portland.

I’ve been in Seattle now for six months and I’m pursuing my dream of photography. I’m mixing it up a bit though and combining my love of adventure, the great outdoors, and portrait photography to create some really badass wedding photography. At least, that’s the goal. I’ve been lucky enough that the community in Seattle is incredibly welcoming and I’ve reached out to some photographers whose work I admire and they’ve lent me a helping hand, I’m constantly humbled and grateful for this community and to have found something that I’m enjoying creating so very much. My goal is to become a destination photographer and use this as a means of traveling all over the world, experiencing new cultures and meeting wonderful people along the way.

There may be a lesson in this somewhere, but really this is just my path and how it’s turned out. I’m just starting out, it can only go up from here. I’m one of the lucky ones.

But my restless spirit can’t be tamed and I’m not too fond of the idea of spending another winter in the Northwest, guess I’m a California girl after all and need a little bit of sun. The question now is, where to next?

Best,

May 2015,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/05/08/no-subject/,"May 2015, 08",(no subject),"I'm a 46-year-old woman, married with an eight-year-old son. I'm funny and talented and extremely creative. I have a rewarding career in the nonprofit world.

I'm also autistic.

Autism is a difficult concept to grasp unless you're living with it or dealing with someone close to you who has it. Most people are quite uncertain about what it actually is; they just know that it's something really, really bad. That's because autism is a very wide spectrum, and it's nearly impossible to paint an accurate picture with just a short definition or soundbyte.So I'd like to paint a picture of what autism looks like for me.

I've always been ""different."" Quirky. Odd. When I was a baby, I crawled backwards. I'm hyperlexic; I started reading at age 2 (yes - really).

Before I was diagnosed, I used to say that I felt like I was ""born without skin."" You know how, if you hurt yourself and abrade away the outermost layer of your skin, suddenly even the tiniest touch is excruciating? That wound might not look like much to others, but it sure hurts like hell. That's kinda what autism is like for me.

Everything about me is like that abraded patch of skin. If you can imagine the outside of your entire body, every inch, lacking that protective outer layer of skin, perhaps you can imagine the level of anxiety that would create, all the time.

A lot of people think of ""high-functioning"" autism as primarily an impairment of social skills. (By the way, ""high-functioning"" is a term I hate for many reasons, but I'm using it here because it may help you understand.)  Yes, I'm quite socially awkward. But my social impairment is minor compared to my sensory challenges. I'm The Princess and the Pea, come to life. I'm exquisitely sensitive. I have supersonic hearing ( I wear noise-cancelling headphones all day at work, usually blasting white noise to drown out distracting sounds around me so I can focus.  I have a hair-trigger startle reflex. If the restaurant menu has too many choices, I have a really hard time focusing on any of them. To button my shirt, I have to close my eyes to block out visual stimuli so I can focus on directing my movements.

As you might imagine, I spend a lot of time looking like a scared chihuahua. Shaking. Panicky. Awkward.

The hardest part is that certain people seem wired to zero in on my exact kinds of vulnerabilities and relish exploiting them. Those are the people who make having autism really, really hard.

Unfortunately, my own mom was one of those people. Fortunately, I found a husband who's the total opposite of that. He's amazing and patient and kind and funny, and so accepting of my quirks. And he helps me heal more every day.

By the way, don't buy the idea that autistics cannot empathize. If anything, I'm far too empathetic. I cry at phone commercials. For me at least, it's a ridiculous excess of empathy (which created in me a lifelong desire to help those in need and seek social justice (there's where the nonprofit thing comes in).

So, with an audience of over 20,000 people, what one request do I make? I don't need or expect others to really understand autism. The only thing I ask is that you be understanding of others' challenges and quirks. Allow everyone their essential humanity and treat everyone with dignity, even though they may be very different from what you're used to.

That one simple thing? It makes all the difference in the world.

I feel like I'm back in school writing an essay the morning it's due.

I am going to publish an audio version of this email on my podcast - just search for ""Goodstuff Daily(ish) 85"". I'm often interested in the voice of a person behind a story or article so if you're like me and would prefer to listen, here's your opportunity.

For Lent this year I gave up using my personal Twitter account. It wasn't done in some grand, dramatic statement over the evilness of Twitter - just a desire to see what kind of effect it was having on my day to day thoughts and ideas. (You can hear my thoughts on this from another podcast I was on by searching for ""Goodstuff Grown-ups 17"".) And I have to say that despite feeling like a Twitter addict - in the best sense of the word - it wasn't as difficult to stop using Twitter as I thought it would be. 

The main benefit I found was that I had more time to think through my opinions on events, news and happenings in my world without having everyone's opinion thrust in my face - albeit willingly. It seems silly, but it did give me clarity of thought. 

I've since gone back on to Twitter - say hi @ichris - but with a much smaller list that I read regularly. I still dip my toes into the main timeline of the 500+ people I follow, but I'm ok with missing out on everything that's happening.

In case you couldn't tell already, I love podcasts - both listening and recording/producing them. And one podcast I do is called Show Me Your Mic where I interview other podcasters about their podcast. Meta upon meta. But I end each show asking them what podcasts they are enjoying currently. And since I don't get to ever say my own, I thought I'd end by listing of some podcasts you should check out if you're looking for something to listen to on the drive home, while walking the dog, or just sitting on the couch:

- Back to Work with Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin: the best podcast about comics that's not about comics- 99% Invisible- Exponent - Ben and James discuss the tech world with smarts I don't possess- Here's the Thing with Alec Baldwin- Transmission - the internet's morning show.- The Incomparable - particularly their episodes on Star Wars.- Build & Launch - by a fellow Canadian dude if you enjoy entrepreneurial web biz dev discussions- One for self-promotion: The podcast network I run with some friends can be found by searching ""Goodstuff podcasts"" and hosts a variety of shows that you may enjoy. 

Thank you for the opportunity to talk to all 20k+ of you. I hope I got at least a 60% on this essay so I don't have to take summer classes.

Hug your kids, have patience and love for your family and above all else - don't watch the leaked episode of Game of Thrones season 5.

One summer I arrived a few weeks late and met two awesome female counselors who already had a great friendship. I clicked with them both almost instantly, and soon all three of us seemed to be hanging out every chance we got. I was drawn and romantically attracted to both of them, but I ""knew"", as far as romance was concerned, I had to “pick” just one of them, even though it felt in some ways arbitrary, especially since we all got along together so well. Why did I have to “pick""?

After more than 7 years of reading, thinking, and experiences after that, I came to recognize myself as polyamorous.

Polyamory (poly for short) is the belief/feeling/act of having multiple loving relationships, loving multiple people at the same time. Polyamory is usually contrasted with monogamy. Polyamory is distinct from other non-monogamous forms because of its focus on relationships, not just sex with other people. Additionally, consent of all partners involved is necessary for ethical polyamory to exist.

I've considered myself polyamorous for about two years now, and for the past 20 months I've been dating a wonderful woman who happens to be engaged to someone that isn't me. It was the first “real” poly relationship any of us had entered into, so we’ve learned a lot, but it's also been and continues to be an amazing and rewarding relationship.

Being poly is often challenging, but any relationship worth having takes some work. The specific challenges may be different, but I don't think it's necessarily harder to be poly than not. In fact, poly people are often more skilled in things like communication and self-knowledge because without these skills you'll quickly find yourself in many undesired situations.

Some dismiss poly people as averse to commitment or choosing polyamory to avoid true intimacy and being fully vulnerable. I disagree. Oftentimes, poly people commit to multiple partners, an act that is more intense, with greater vulnerability, than someone who is monogamous.

Some people believe being polyamorous is a choice, though for me it is a part of my identity, just like being gay/straight/queer/bisexual/pansexual/asexual is innate to a person. One CAN chose it as a relationship structure, but for myself and many others, it's an innate quality, a feeling that exists whether we act on it or not.

I sometimes think about trying to live a conventional, monogamous life; while it would certainly be “easy” is some ways (i.e. socially acceptable, and thus less oppressive), I know I would be hiding a part of my identity, which I never want to do.

I'm not saying everyone should be poly. Polyamory isn't for everyone. I've seen innately non-poly people try to live polyamorously, usually to be/stay with a partner who identifies as poly, but if it's not your innate way of doing relationships, it can be challenging or even impossible.

(Life lesson alert:) It's important that you figure out your wants and needs in relationships and then be open and honest in communicating them with those you love and are interested in.

If you'd like to learn more about this topic, I'd love to have an e-conversation with you/answer any questions you have. I also highly recommend the wonderful “More Than Two” (dotcom) website. It's extremely comprehensive and deals with many things I had no room for here.

Shout out to my Boopy, who's taught me so much and who I love very much.

Be yourself, y’all. It’s how you’ll be happy.

The reason why I read the Listserve emails is not for the stories, the anecdotes, the new insights or the advice. What interests me is the question: what do people write when they have the chance to say something to a lot of people? And, why do they choose that particular topic?

If I were to summarize the different responses people gave over the years, I would say that they most often use one of the following forms: this is what I do, this is who I am, this happened to me, this is what I love, this helped me, this could help you, this is funny or this tastes very good.

So, what does this say about us? Well, frankly, I don't know. What I do know is that I miss one kind of category. This category entails emails about the Listserve itself. No lengthy discussion on this peculiar, virtual platform. No comprehensive study on the way people answer the Listserve's request. Don't worry, I am not going to start now, but it is kind of interesting, isn't it?

I, for one, always end up with questions like these. With 'questions like these' I mean questions that play at some sort of meta-level. I cannot look at something without being aware of the way I am looking. Or, more or less concrete example, when I am having a dicussion I often end up discussing the way we are discussing. This not infrequently to the frustration of the one sitting opposit of me. With the Listserve this is the same. Even though I somethimes enjoy the content, I always wander off. Why do people invent things like the Listserve, and why is nobody writing about this? Are other people wondering the same, and do they also wonder if other people are wondering about what they are wondering about?

I, as you might have guessed, can stay in metapotamia all day long. Not in the sense that I have the capacity for it, but in the sense that I enjoy it. For me it is like using a shovel. When done using it you often just have a hole in the ground, and, well, that isn't much to show for. You can try and sit in it, but it probably isn’t very comfortable. Often, when you start digging, all you find is another layer of dirt. Dirt not meaning something purely negative of course. Sometimes you find something you wouldn't find above ground, sometimes you hit rock bottom. But it's always good excercise.

This very vague analogy may be the reason why the Listserve email only saying “Buy a bulldozer” still intrigues me.

On purpose or not, I leave many questions open. If you, despite this, feel like responding, I will gladly read it. Me and my mind are starting up a business, so everything that can spark up anything is welcome.  I might even send an email back depending on, well, unkown future things.

Best whishes,

May 2015,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/05/01/deaf-people-and-the-hearing-world/,"May 2015, 01",Deaf People and the Hearing World,"As a deaf person in the United States, I live in a kind of deaf world where I can see different communities and individuals interact and clash and collaborate, where I can see deaf accomplishments and struggles shared on a daily basis. It makes me wonder how much a hearing person knows about any of this if they only have a secondhand impression of deaf people. There's so much that goes on, and I hope to provide some insight in this email.

To be Deaf, with a capital D, is to see one's deafness as a cultural trait instead of as a disability. (Hence the term ""Deaf culture"".) Today, there are hearing aids and cochlear implants that treat hearing loss, but before this technology, sign language was (and still is) the linchpin of Deaf people.

The advent of this technology has led to a clash of perspectives: disability vs. cultural. Hearing people see deafness as a disability that needs to be fixed. Deaf people do not see deafness as a disability to be fixed. These differing perspectives have formed a very large gap in understanding.

Oralism is a system that teaches deaf people to hear and speak instead of using sign language. From a disability perspective, this sounds good, since the rest of the world hears and speaks. However, this system has long overlooked the cultural aspect of deafness. There is a very rich and close-knit Deaf community, Deaf people do live full lives (as hard as it may be for hearing people to comprehend). Oralism has long been anathema to Deaf people when they see a deaf child that could be part of their community instead be assimilated away from them, with no connection to Deaf people before them. Look past the disability perspective for a moment and consider this with other underrepresented groups. Children of indigenous peoples have been put through assimilation. Gay people have been put through assimilation. Sex-selective abortion takes place to ensure a boy instead of a girl. To put it another way, oralism is hearing people representing the deaf community.

This does not mean that oralism does not work. Deaf children can grow up with hearing aids or cochlear implants and be assimilated in the hearing world. Sometimes that assimilation is complete. Sometimes that technology is not good enough, and such oral deaf people can be left out, especially in noisy and/or crowded environments. They bond with others like them in a kind of sub-community. While the technology is a way of them accommodating themselves for the hearing world, the hearing world still needs to accommodate them -- and Deaf people who are not oral. Both groups need translation-based services like captioning and oral or sign interpreting, yet despite these commonalities, the gap in perspective (disability vs. cultural) prevents compelling alliances to foment change in the hearing world to accommodate them.

This does not mean there are no hearing aid or cochlear implant users in the Deaf community. Bilingualism is an approach in which a deaf person can both speak and sign. Unfortunately, this approach is relatively novel, since oralism and sign language were historically seen as mutually exclusive. (Oralism's conventional wisdom, which persists to this day, is that sign language should be excluded for oralism to work. Imagine how the Deaf community feels about that.)

There's much more to cover, though. Hearing people who become deaf later in life and may be in denial or fear stigma. A notion called audism about superiority based on being able to hear. Et cetera. If you have any questions and comments, please email me.

April 2015,30,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/04/30/provoke-accountability/,"April 2015, 30",Provoke Accountability,"Hi Listserve, I live and work in Washington D.C. I'm 25 and I've worked in the DC non-profit world my entire professional life. While much can be said about the pros and cons of working in such a field, in my opinion the best part is working for an organization with a mission you can believe in. So I'd like to use this space to share some information about the Project On Government Oversight (POGO). 

Lewis Black called POGO ""the most ass-kicking, name-taking, bunch of goodie-two-shoes, good government types in America."" 

POGO is a nonpartisan, independent watchdog that champions good government reform in the U.S. We work with whistleblowers, government insiders and the Congress to expose problems and explore solutions. For 35 years POGO has investigated corruption, waste, and misconduct in order to achieve a more accountable and ethical federal government. We work on all kinds of issues, from wasteful spending in the defense department, to conflicts of interest on Wall Street, to faulty medical devices approved by the FDA, to whistleblower retaliation in the VA and much more. 

I wanted to talk about POGO here because I often feel like it's hard not to see a big old cloud of doom over the capitol these days. Frustration with the U.S. Congress is at all time high and many Americans feel like they're not being heard. But there are still people and organizations that devote themselves to fixing these seemingly insurmountable problems. And they have not been without their successes. 

I don't want to end this on a downer so here are a few fun facts I've learned during my time as a nuclear security investigator at POGO: 

The world's largest nuclear stockpile is guarded, in part, by over 80 military dolphins trained by the U.S. Navy. Also around 50 sea lions. 

There are 92 known cases of nuclear bombs lost at sea. 

In 1962 a U.S. B-52 bomber accidentally dropped two hydrogen bombs on North Carolina. One of the bombs went through all of the arming stages except one, and it is only because one switch wasn't switched that there wasn't a full scale thermonuclear explosion in NC.

Thank-you to everyone for reading this and to the Listserve for this very cool platform. Check out POGO's website if you want to know more about what we do and check out Eric Schlosser's book Command and Control for more fun stories of near nuclear disasters.

     There was a clown, I forget his name, but he once said that to be entertaining, you must be interested, not interesting. So long as someone has a passion or an eagerness for something, even the most mundane things come alive!

Words. Auto-Antonyms are words that can act as opposites of themselves. Fast: can be to move quickly, or can be used as an adverb “To hold fast” means to not move.

Silly competitions. I took 6th place in the North American Wife Carrying Championship. It took me and my “wife” 19 hours of driving, rush hours in New York, Philadelphia and DC, my car’s water pump, and a house fire to get there and back. I competed in the World Stone Skimming Competition on Easdale Island in Scotland. It took me two attempts to get to it, and I nearly missed it the second time if I hadn’t had amazing luck hitchhiking. Next on my list is the Woolly Worm festival in North Carolina I’ll go to one day… They’re all so silly and wonderful.

Puzzle Hunts. I am currently planning my most cunning and amazing Puzzle hunt Yet! It’s going to have Payphones, Reverse-Geo Caches, Hollow books, and an exciting plot. This is possibly my greatest passion; I once cut a bowling ball in half with a hand saw to hide a clue. I collected acorns outside of a tattoo parlor, painted them, and put them into a moonshine jug to create another clue. Tell me of your puzzles and scavenger hunt adventures!

Puss in Boots. Do you know the story of Puss in Boots? No? No need to read it. That’s the whole point: What you imagine it to be, if you believe it enough, it will be come true. Lie your way into a truth. I believe that people can transform themselves, so it must be true.

Time.  Many of the days of the week are named after visible celestial bodies. Moon-day, Sun-Day, Saturn-day. It’s easy to see in Spanish as well: Llunes. Meircoles. Thor’s Day, however, is another story… How months got their names is wonderful as well!

Time-space. I studied physics and philosophy at the University of Virginia so That I might be able to better understand the world. Time Dilation, Relativity, and any Modern Physics or Astronomy is beautiful and amazing…

And all the people around me. People are deeply interesting, full of detail and character; I have to appreciate all those whom help create this rich and beautiful world.

To have a better understanding of something is to appreciate it more.

What sparks your life? Do any of these topics fascinate you?

Well, it happened to me. And then I quit. Because something fell into my lap and I felt a sense of duty mixed with a sense of impending FOMO.

I would win the listserve while traveling across Iowa in a 12-passenger van on day five of my new job. I can't offer you any solid life advice because I don't know yet whether this crazy and borderline idiotic thing I just did will pay off or not.

But I do know that there is a reason I'm here. It's the thing that led me to my dream job (did I mention I loved that job?) and to this new situation and will probably ultimately drive me to do something even more outlandish at some future point. And that is that 95 years ago, Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment (thanks, Harry T. Burn - google it) and [many] women gained the constitutional right to vote.

I think about this a lot. So much, in fact, that my only tattoo says ""8.18.1920."" I just can't get over the fact that less than 100 years ago, a bunch of badass women who were told to leave the politics to the menfolk decided they were going to be both seen and heard and fought like hell to demand a voice in their government. Women my age (27) and younger pulled together an epic suffrage parade on the day of President Wilson's inauguration, strategized with workers and society women, picketed the White House with the President's own words on democracy, met with senators they couldn't vote for, got arrested, went on hunger strikes in prison. And in the end, they won.

They made history - and now I feel I owe it to them to raise some hell. Or at the very least, vote.

Three options for what you could do next:

1) Watch the movie Iron Jawed Angels. Hillary Swank as Alice Paul (aka the most inspiring historical figure you've never heard of) is one of the best things that has ever happened in American cinema. 2) Go see what the Women on 20s campaign is all about, because as I have just explained, learning about women who made history makes this generation of women feel like we can do it, too. Obviously I voted for Alice Paul (see above).3) Make sure everyone you know is registered to vote & has what they need on Election Day. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, the number of voters disenfranchised in 2014 in North Carolina by harsh new voter ID laws and restrictions on voting hours may have been the margin of victory. What?! We cannot let that kind of thing happen in this country.

Do you also feel strongly about voting? Have a favorite historical figure who inspires you? Are you looking for someone to argue with about whether the National Woman's Party or the National American Woman Suffrage Association got the strategy right first? You should definitely tell me.

April 2015,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/04/24/music-goosebumps/,"April 2015, 24",Music Goosebumps,"Hello everyone!

There's a phenomenon that exists only auditorily, wherein certain sounds or musical phrases can elicit a response similar to having sex, eating fried food or doing recreational drugs.  You feel a chill down your spine, you get goosebumps on your skin, and you become slightly euphoric (due to the sudden flood of dopamine).

While infrequent, this response to certain musical phrases or sounds makes the act of listening to music one of the most pleasurable activities in which one can engage.  I've therefore spent a good amount of time digging through my mental trove of sounds that cause me to react this way, and have shared them with you below.

I was homeless for about 2 months. My fault, my mistakes;I won't talk about them here. I do want to share with you someinteresting circumstances I lived through during these 2 long months.

Food was hard to come by but I got to know where free meals were beingserved eventually. Some places were great, others not so. When Ifinally got into a homeless shelter this one short woman who thoughshe was the queen of the world kicked me out for laughing at her. Itried to stop myself but she got so caught up in the fact that therewas a pillow thief running around. So I went to this horrible shelter.Drug addicts, alcoholics, etc. I tried using the restroom but becausethat was the only place with no cameras, all the addicts would snort,inject, smoke stuff and there was always a perpetual haze in there. Iwould come out all dizzy and light-headed from the fumes.

This one time, a dude I've never seen before tried to show mesomething in the bathroom. It glinted shiny so my immediatte thoughwas ""knife!"" I raised my hand to block it and was about to hit himwhen it was revealed to be just a lighter. Whew...

I also apperantly took some dude's spot and he got all pissy. He gotkicked out, his brother didn't. I spent the whole night stressed andwith one eye open thinking I was going to be shanked by the brother.Luckily, I got out of there quick as the better shelter had a vacancy.I made sure to stay away from that Short Queen.

I had one last trial before getting out of homelessness: I fell into aCatch-22. I had already started a nice, Monday to Friday job. Too badthe DMV isn't open on Saturdays so I couldn't get an ID for a prettylong time. I needed my ID to cash my check, but I need my check cashedto pay for an ID. Luckily, a coworker helped me out by cashing mycheck for me. And then I find out I need to wait 2 weeks beforereceiving it in the mail. That was convenient /s.

We played a lot of cards. Talked a lot about random things. Itactually surprised me that I could find other ""normal"" people there. Iguess life doesn't discriminate when it wants to hit hard. It justsucks that mistakes people make follow them for a long time afterthey've been made. And when humans do try to get their life turnedaround, it feels like every stride one takes, the government hits youand tries to keep you from improving. Poor tax. I had to pay huge feesjust because I was poor which kept me poor. Even though I've neverbeen addicted to anything, I think me trying to climb out ofhomelessness and poverty was a sort of metaphor the Universe wanted meto understand for what addicts were going through.

Thank you, Universe. Thanks for the enemies, thanks for the friends.Thanks for... perspective.

Funny how i get to send this mail right now. This morning i realized that i've been collecting listserve emails for over a year without reading them so i started to read them again and will keep reading a couple of them a day until i read them all and it’s great!I am sorry in advance for the text, i will probably jump from one text to another.

Something about me maybe. I am computer security enthusiast, beginner Geocacher (check out Geocaching), programmer both private and professionally, nerd and a little bit of an all doer.I used to think that the word nerd were negative and usually got angry when someone called me that but i changed my mind and now i think is great to be a nerd. It usually means that you are an enthusiast of something and i would guess pretty good at it. From my perspective it seems like the nerds are more fun than other people as well.

This weekend me and my girlfriend went geocaching in the forest nearby and it was pretty exciting because it was the first time we tried it, so there we went on this real life treasure hunt.We went into the forest a sunny afternoon and we brought out our map with the coordinates to this first treasure and pretty fast we saw that it wasn’t too far away. When we got closer to the coordinates there was a wooden bridge. We went over it and down one of the sides carefully to not slip into the water and checked under it. And would you look at that…

A horrific toad!

No actually there was a magnetic PET tube with paper and a pencil inside. We logged our visit and got on our way again. Brought up our map and checked the coordinates to the next treasure.We got deeper into the forest and picked up a couple of caches on our way but we were on our way to one specific cache, at an old army training field.We got to the specified coordinates but could not really find anything but dead trees and we almost gave up, my girlfriend told me that we should give it one last try and so we did! I got back to the first place i looked at and found a little door with a broken lock. I opened it and will you look at that! An old bunker, i gave my girlfriend the flashlight and crawled inside to get a better look, it went down and had a door on the other side as well. I saw that door before but it was locked.I went down and took some easy steps because it was some trash down there and BOOM! the door closed hard and it went pitch black… a scream! me i realized soon enough. I crawled up and clawed for the door and, puh! the door went up and there she was smiling her brightest smile that went into a laugh… I grinned at her and told her that if she wanted this treasure she had to get into the bunker as well to light the way. We got down there again and after a while we found it! It was a great cache, not many other had found it. A great day!

If you are in the IT business you will probably appreciate a tumblr called Devops Reactions, search for it. It is great!

I would love to hear from other Geocachers and get your stories!

April 2015,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/04/19/some-unconventional-las-vegas-travel-advice/,"April 2015, 19",Some Unconventional Las Vegas Travel Advice,"Go outside. Close your eyes. Grab a piece of paper currency out of your pocket, wallet, or purse without looking at it. Then let it go. Do not check what the denomination is first. Do not crumple it, or rip it, or burn it. Just let the wind take it.  We do not want to destroy it. We want someone else to get it.

If you cannot stand the idea of doing that, then my Las Vegas advice is not for you.

But if doing something like that has any kind of appeal - the randomness, the recklessness, the “guess what I just did?” storytelling aspect, or imagining what the person who FINDS the bill will feel...then read on.

I love Las Vegas. There is an energy there that is palpable. I know I am not alone, because the city draws 40 million tourists a year from around the globe. And everyone has advice for what to do - the top 10 lists, the must-see lists, and so on.

We can dispense with that quickly. There is only one must-see: the Bellagio fountains.

What I want to tell you is how to get an experience for your money, by being loose with it.

Here are 7 suggestions for your next trip to Las Vegas:

1. While on the way from one spot to another and walking through a casino, bet $100, cash, on a table bet, and add an extra $20 for the dealer. Just step up and do it. One hand of blackjack, a roulette spin, the pass line at craps - whatever. Just do it. No ceremony, no chips, no delay. And no hanging around, win or lose.

2. Buy a bottle of champagne. You can do it at a night club, but a less traditional time and place makes it better. Do it as your first round of drinks at dinner. Get one at a casino lounge bar.  Order one poolside. Use room service if you are with someone special.

3. Play credit card roulette. When out with friends for drinks or a meal, do not split the bill. Take a napkin from the table, or a hat, and have everyone put in a credit card. Ask the server to pull out cards one at a time until one remains. That is who pays the bill.

4. Tip the maitre d’ when you arrive at a restaurant.

5. Get in a cab, and when the driver asks where you are going, say “I’m not going anywhere - you’re going to lunch.” Hand them a $20 and then get back out of the cab. Works best if you spot a cab stand with no passengers waiting and a small number of cabs queued up. You don’t want to take a cab from someone who may be waiting, or make a cabbie lose his spot in what was a long line of cabs looking for fares.

6. Group parlay. Pick a sport (horse-racing will do) and everyone makes one pick from different events and throws in $5. Buy a parlay card for the full amount using each person's pick. You will not win. You will be able to tease relentlessly the person who made the wrong pick.

7. Do the “bill in the wind” stunt from the start of this email. Anything found on a casino floor is considered part of the house win, so be sure you are off property, and preferably not surrounded by people. Carson street downtown can work.

Changing your attitude to money can make a big difference in how you enjoy yourself in Vegas. And elsewhere.

I was PIP'd at work but I managed to not get axed but forced my work to give me a demotion because it looked very suspect they wanted to lay me off right before my baby's due date. I have started baby classes for my second child. First one is a girl named Gracie and the second is a boy who is coming June 15th. Any names you guys recommend? 

I am 34 married and grew up in San Ramon Ca. I didn't go to IVY league I actually failed out of college and went back as an adult and graduated last year with a business degree from a Cal State CSUEB. Yes kids you can fail and get back in! My passion is the music industry but it is very hard to get a family sustaining wage while working in it. 

So here I am at work demoted but stronger because of it. The clarity a jarring change can have on your life is immense. My family and my kids are all that matter. Not what job or how much money I have. Anyone looking to hire me? I can send you my resume. :)

April 2015,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/04/16/the-metaverse-is-virtually-real/,"April 2015, 16",The Metaverse is (virtually) real!,"Dearest Listservians,

It has been my pleasure to read your stories, musings, pleas, playlists, tips, tricks, philosophies and travelogues. I love the fleeting glimpses into so many interesting lives that the listserve lottery elicits.

As for me, I am currently recovering from running a startup with my wife for seven years. The company lives on, but it needs city planners with spreadsheets and procedures, not pioneers with machetes and delusions of grandeur. As a result, I find myself, once again, trying to decide what I want to do when I grow up.

My early background was in film and television and I have always been drawn to storytelling arts of one kind or another.

When I first left our startup I was so steeped in the silicon valley Kool-Aid that I became deeply allergic to social media in almost every form. I felt that mass communication was becoming infinity wide and about a micron deep. Avoiding social media isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but just thinking about the amount of ‘social media strategy’ needed to produce an independent film today gave me that Irish-bachelor-party-hangover feeling. I needed about a year of BoingBoing and a lot of books before I would even consider coming out of my shell.

It’s been more than a year and I still can’t use Facebook, but I’ve added Twitter Tuesday to my routine (just lurking for now) and I use email like a kid trying to grab something out of a dark basement. (No matter how fast I retreat up the stairs, I still feel like something REALLY bad is about to catch me and drag me in.) But my creative spirit is starting to stir.

I followed the kickstarter for Oculus Rift and the slow but determined resurgence of the virtual reality vision with a basic tech-geek fascination. But when I saw the early experiments with virtual reality (VR) filmmaking - that piqued my interest. Something big is happening here.

VR filmmaking is the process of making movies by shooting with a whole bunch of video cameras pointing in all directions. You then ‘stitch’ all of the videos together using ad-hoc tools, and an impossible amount of patience. The result is a ‘spherical’ video that you watch using one of those geeky looking virtual reality headsets that you are seeing all over the news nowadays. The video plays all around you, but you only see the part that you are looking at - like life! The director loses control of attention management in some ways (e.g. no close-ups to show you what’s important) but the feeling of watching something interesting play out around you and not breaking the illusion when you turn away is profound, and immersive, and all the other buzz words that will try to convey how cool this really is.

I’ve built 3 different camera rigs to shoot VR video with and have spent countless hours stitching the videos together. I’m learning all about stereoscopic parallax, Interpupillary distances and simulator sickness, but the best part is… It’s pioneer time again! No business models in sight. No monetization strategies. No SEO. No social media efforts to leverage your community. Just grab your machete and start chopping through the vines!

It’s rough now. Even the short videos produced by the cash-infused pioneers have a basement-lab quality to them. That’s to be expected. This is only the PONG version of the metaverse, but I can see the future from here and it is transformational. I’m convinced that we are on the verge of a new way of telling (and experiencing) cinematic stories. This is a huge step for filmmaking. Bigger than color - more like talkies.

Anyway, stay tuned. Exciting stuff to come. If you get the chance to try out somebody’s virtual reality setup, do it.

Switching gears to the traditional listserve signoff…

I don’t claim to have the key to happiness, but when I do these things, I feel like I might just be able to pick the lock.

- Listen to the audio book of Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth with Bill Moyers. Just do it.

- If you are on a spiritual path and are curious what would happen if you mashed up western therapy and Buddhism, check out Bruce Tift’s audio program called Already Free. It resonated deeply with me and has changed my life.

Finally, if you are interested in VR filmmaking or storytelling in the metaverse, drop me a line. The nights out here in the wilderness can be pretty lonely and I’d love to sit around the campfire and swap stories from the trail.

Kind regards

A story It's late Sunday afternoon and I am sitting in front of the mural I have been painting for the last two days. The sun is streaming in from the widows to the west and I am listening to Mark Farina - Dream Machine. The mural is one large square wall and mostly abstract shapes - like an Arshile Gorky painting. Before I started, I was trying to describe to my friend how I felt about the mural - ""it's like how you feel right before performing if you're a musician or before playing a game if you're an athlete... it's emotional. It's gonna get tough in there if the wall doesn't agree with me, I'll have to work through the challenges until it's where it feels right."" 

A requestI'd like to use this opportunity to reach out to the thousands of readers here for some help. Do you have friends or relatives with a physical disability who work from home? I'd love to hear your stories and/or advice on what's possible and what's available. I constantly feel guilty that I don't do enough to try to help my relative by providing more support and more opportunities, and so I super especially appreciate it if you reply with your thoughts. 

A present for you Lastly, I recently started this project where I make lots of tiny collages and tiny paintings (like 2"" x 3"") and mailing them out to my friends since they easily fit in an envelope. If you'd like to receive one, email me a mailing address and I'll send one over! It makes me happy to share these little pieces with others and I hope you'll like them too.

April 2015,14,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/04/14/6-surprising-facts-about-healthcare-reform/,"April 2015, 14",6 surprising facts about healthcare reform,"I'm a bit of a healthcare reform nerd, largely due to my experience as an entrepreneur trying to keep myself, my family, and my employees insured while bouncing from company to company and state to state. At one point, due to seemingly imaginary ""pre-existing conditions"" I came very close to not being able to buy insurance for my family at any price, despite us all being healthy.

So I was glad that the Obama administration had the guts to push the Affordable Care Act through, even though it ended up being a Frankenstein's monster that's almost fatally compromised by the various concessions to industry that were necessary to ensure its passage. Nevertheless, it's built on a solid foundation of good ideas.

But here are some of the mostly-unintended, especially nutty aspects of the law. Some of them are pretty harmful, in large part because people don't know much about the ACA other than the spin that the talking heads are making, pro and con.

Did you know....

...that many companies are screwing over their employees while they think they're doing something good? Offering insurance to employees' families (especially if you don't offer a generous contribution toward family coverage) locks them out of eligibility for subsidies, and millions of workers would actually be better off today if their employers out-and-out dropped their health plan?

...that signing up for COBRA could be a very stupid thing to do (because what you should do if you lose your job is immediately sign up for an Obamacare plan, and staying on COBRA makes you ineligible for a money-saving subsidy), but your company is still required to send you information that tells you to sign up for COBRA?

...that by giving your employees a rich health benefit, you are in many cases actually doing them a big disservice, especially if they're young? (Because many employees would actually be better served by being signed up for ""cheaper"" health insurance if they're healthy and having the extra money redirected into their paycheck)

...that under the current norms of health benefits, many companies may have two people with the same job and same salary but one makes 50% less in total compensation? (because if you have a big family, it's not uncommon for one person's health benefit to be thousands of dollars higher than another's).

...that if your state hasn't expanded Medicaid, you could be locked out from Obamacare subsidies because you're too poor? (In this case, if you made just a little bit more, you could save thousands of dollars on health insurance)  If you knew that, did you know that the IRS has said it's okay if you exaggerate your income in order to get the subsidy? (But nobody knows this)

You might know that you can now only sign up for health insurance during an open enrollment period. Did you know there's a loophole that would allow you to sign up for a new health plan any time, even if you wouldn't normally qualify for a special enrollment period? (Apply for Medicaid, even if you know you make too much. Being formally turned down for Medicaid triggers a special enrollment period).

So, dear Listservers, if you find any of these fact interesting and illuminating, let me know. In particular, if you're a business owner that would like to do right by your lower-wage employees and find out how you can find win-wins in Obamacare, let me know. That's what my company, Benefitter, does. If you're in the media and you'd like to do a healthcare reform story that will surprise and outrage people, also let me know, and I'll give you more details.

April 2015,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/04/13/critical-mass/,"April 2015, 13",Critical mass,"Dear, listservDo you ride a bike? Have you ever heard of critical mass? If you do and you havent, this is my call to action to you.

Critical mass is the most fun you'll have on a bike. So what is it? Its an informal mass bike ride that happens on the last Friday of every month. In Los Angeles, it meets at Wilshire and Western. Its a good idea for riders to meet beforehand, but as long as you get your ass to the start point at 730, when the ride rolls out, you're good to go.

Last friday, I was winding down work for the week and getting ready for critical mass, when the the listserv gods tapped my shoulder. I wanted to share this monthly ritual I have with you all, so that the ride may grow into the listserv community.  The point of the ride is to gather enough cyclists on the road that it forces cars to heed to the 'critical mass' of bikes.  Cars might hate it, but don't judge us until you've been on a ride yourself. It's a envigorating experience, and I guarentee you'll see los angeles from a point of view that shifts perspective. It's just a little bit crazy. It's all controlled chaos. And it's a hell of a lot of fun.

That's my 2 cents. I'm also writing this email while with my family. We're celebrating my grandmother who wouldve been 100 this year. She passed away when I was in high school. I didn't know her too well but I hear she was a baller. All she did was help my fathers family move to America from Korea (doesn't matter which one). Respect to her.

Shout out to all my sheep zodiac year family. I was born in 91. I can't explain my good luck this year, must be because of that. 

Btw if you don't live in LA, chances are that your city might have one too. It'll probably be on the last Friday of the month. Hit me up if you want to ride.

Peace.

The inventor sat in silence thoughtfully, then replied that he merely wanted some rice to feed his family. To determine how much rice he would receive, they would use the chessboard square as a counter. The inventor suggested that, for the first square, he would receive one grain of rice, two for the second square, four for the third square, doubling each the amount for each successive square. The King laughed at this seemingly modest request and immediately accepted, tasking his treasurer with calculating the entire amount to grant the inventor. Weeks went by without hearing from his treasurer until one day, the King summoned his treasurer and asked why there was such a delay. When the treasurer showed him the total sum exceeded the rice count of his entire kingdom, the King was bankrupted and the inventor became the new King.What was the total amount?

This heap of rice would be larger than Mt Everest.

There is a pond with invasive water lilies. The water lily population doubles each day and if left unchecked, will cover the entire pond in 30 days, smothering all other life in the pond. Each day, the caretaker of the pond checks the population, and will only take action to cut the water lily population when they have covered only half the pond.

On what day will the pond be half-covered?

...

The 29th day. This leaves the pond caretaker only 1 day to save the pond.

Exponential growth, or compounded growth, is a very powerful thing. Positive things like savings, investment, networks and technological innovation can bring incredible improvements to one's life, if allowed to compound without interruption. On the flip side, if left unchecked, dangerous things like inflation, debts, diseases or even dangerous ideologies can sneak up on you so quickly that you won't notice until it's too late.

Don't wait until the 29th day.

--Karl Ove Knausgaard, My Struggle: Book One

***

That thought you just had, or the one you’re having right now, or the one you’ll have in the next instant—how do each of these thoughts that float across your conscious mind come into existence? It’s instinctual to believe that we author our own thoughts; that each of us has “free will” and thus can choose to think whatever it is we want to think at any moment in time.

But what if this was not true?

What if free will was merely an illusion? What if the feeling that we were the conscious authors of the inner narrative of our minds, was only that: a feeling? And that instead, those things we interpret as conscious thoughts were in fact the result of biological, chemical and physical forces beyond our control and simply the product of the same laws of nature and probability that govern every other part of the universe? What then? How might we view our place in the world differently if that were the case?

First off, some might consider it a bleak truth. Where is the romance in relegating all human thought and creativity and action to cold unalterable probability functions collapsing around us at every instant, bringing possibility into reality without our say? Rather than bleak, I tend to think of this idea as staggeringly beautiful. To think of our minds as mere envelopes of the universe expressing itself through us is one way of conceiving of all of humanity, not to mention all of space and time, as irrevocably connected in a way that is deeply spiritual without needing to invoke the notion of god or religious doctrine or science fiction to get there.

Second, if all of the thoughts we have, both good and bad, are games of chance resolving themselves at every moment in time, then we might think twice about how we cast judgment on others. We might do well to reign in our deification of the individuals—the artists, the musicians, the inventors—who create and do good things (those who have ""good"" thoughts) and reconsider how we look down upon the fallen—the criminals, the troubled, the lazy—who fail to do good or actively do harm (those who have ""bad"" thoughts). We might choose to celebrate more communally the accomplishments of the few and to exercise more compassion towards the (apparent) errors of the many. Removing the illusion of free will deflates the primacy of the individual, which, in turn grants us the opportunity to inflate our regard for the other.

Finally, if our thoughts are ultimately outside our control, we might grow a deeper appreciation for the outsized role chance plays in determining the course of our lives from beginning to end. No one would question the fact that chance entirely dictates the parents to which we are born. Nor is it controversial to suggest that nature and nurture thenceforth determine the people we become, exactly to the extent they influence the choices we, as individuals, are free to make. But if (as we’re presuming here) we’re not actually truly free in making those choices, then nature and nurture alone, not ourselves, dictate—entirely!—our makeup, down to every conscious thought we ever have. Does this not humble? Just as Carl Sagan demonstrated with Pale Blue Dot (Voyager 1’s photo of Earth as a tiny, light-blue speck in the vast expanse of space) that our place in the universe, relative to its size, is utterly insignificant, so too are our conscious minds insignificant, when viewed as purely governed by the whimsies of probability—like the random, ever-changing, and ultimately meaningless patterns that clouds trace in the sky.

I'm an engineer in the sense that my paid vocation is in engineering, but I'm also an engineer in the broader sense that I enjoy solving problems wherever I can. This isn't always a virtue - I sometimes find that one problem is just the top of the rabbit hole, and the rabbit hole gets deep very quickly. Nonetheless, it means I think frequently about the gap between what's possible with current technology and what currently exists. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the field of medical technology, where I currently spend most of my time.

Medicine is a funny area, disconnected from the market norms that define most of the world. People are willing to spend all their money on their health, and often do (and then some). Given this, I feel there is an ethical obligation on those of us who provide medical technology and services to do so in a way that is not driven by pure profit maximisation.

Unfortunately much of healthcare is not like this, irrespective of the precise structure underpinning its provision.

In countries with socialised medicine, such as the UK, in which maximal ""profit"" typically manifests as political profit, skewed by public perception of healthcare provision and driven by metrics such as access to emotionally charged treatments, there is a huge problem of initiating meaningful improvement without causing political disruption.

In countries with private systems like the US, the arguably bigger problem exists that the cost of healthcare provision is inflated to the extent that a disproportionate percentage of GDP is diverted to it, and those who can't pay often do without. 

My point is this: it behoves every one of us - those who work in the medical sector, as well as patients - to work hard against the easy route of allowing more and more resources to be sunk into fewer improvements.

This comes back to where I started. Every change should be done with a view to improving the world, and every problem that is apparent should be fixed wherever it can be. This isn't a new notion. Much of industry has adopted the approach of continuous and evolutionary improvement, and it's largely done by engaging all the stake holders in the process, from shop floor workers through to end customers. Many systems and processes exist to help with this. The time is here for this to become the norm in healthcare. I'm aware there are many attempts to make this happen, but medicine is still far behind many areas, such as manufacturing.

It should not be acceptable to have tech with inflated prices just so the cost can be shifted to a per-use model. It should not be acceptable that a patient coming to Accident & Emergency is re-assessed by five different healthcare workers asking the same questions. It should not be acceptable for patients to visit the emergency department with a cold.

Everyone, from the porter, to the patient, to the top consultant, can be a problem-solver. They can be engineers. If anyone is interested, my start-up is involved in developing a super low-cost medical ultrasound system. The technology is 30 years old, it's about time the cost reflected that. Please feel free to get in touch if any of this interests you, or if your area happens to align with mine!

My grandmother was the light that transformed Sam’s depressive darkness into joy. Under every crazy hat, behind every kazoo song, next to every center stage performance, was my grandmother. She was Sam’s foundation, Sam’s home base, Sam’s safety net which allowed him to dream so fearlessly.

With oxygen mask on, IV’s connected, he lifts his hands and I play “You are my Sunshine, my only Sunshine…” on my kazoo as my family sings along.  Sam’s School then travels backwards in time, tracing my grandfather’s life from his birth to this grand finale. However, Sam’s death is not where any story ends. It is not where his story, Student U’s story, or my story ends, and least of all, it is not where my grandmother’s story ends.

This was the unwritten scene right after Sam’s final song:

She sits in the waiting room but no longer has anything to wait for.  Three minutes earlier her husband of sixty years heart rate slowed to zero.  One day earlier she had said her final goodbye, brushing her left hand over his right.  Three days earlier she was told there was no hope and asked the doctor to please let him go in peace.  Three weeks earlier she had been told lymphoma.  And now she is in the waiting room waiting for nothing.

She looks straight ahead at a new chapter in her life’s story.  Over the previous sixty years she has played sidekick to the protagonist.  Now she will take center stage.  Their journey will become her path.  Their duet will become her solo.  Her song will sound different than their song.  He used to kazoo as she sang along.  Now her voice will alone need to carry the tune.  But rather than allow their last performance to be her crescendo, she is determined for an encore worthy of a standing ovation.

She sits in the waiting room ready for everything.  Her fingers rub the wedding ring which 60 years ago was too tight and now is a permanent fixture on her hand.  She holds his hand in her heart, breaths in deeply, breaths out slowly, and begins the rest of her life.

The rest of her life lasts four and a half years, a full four and a half years longer than any of us expected. During those years, my grandma was able to celebrate mine and Amanda’s wedding and sing to my daughter, her great grandchild.

When my daughter Eliana turned one month old, my grandma called and sang “You are my sunshine, my only sunshine…”

And the whole world keeps spinning. Joy begets joy, life begets life, and we continue to celebrate our place in the journey.

Eliana never was able to meet my grandma or my grandpa. But tonight, I will pull her close to me and sing “You and my sunshine, my only sunshine…” And through this song, and through my love, and through our joy, Eliana will know her great grandparents.

Did you everenvision something so complex that, despite appearing crystal clear inyour mind, escaped every time you tried put it into words? This is myjob. I work with supercomputers.

My favorite Listserve stories are those where people share insightsinto their daily lives. I am pursuing a PhD in computer science. Acommon question for me is: ""Could you tell me what you're working on?Can I comprehend this at all?"" -- which really is more depressing thanflustering. Right now I'm sitting on a couch in Baton Rouge. I'mcollaborating with scientists from LSU (hey there!) on a project toimprove the fidelity of storm surge prediction. Not complicated atall. Do you remember hurricane Katrina?

But let's start at the very beginning. What is a supercomputer? Forstarters, it's not the new MacBook. Supercomputers are essentiallytens of thousands of networked computers. They are so huge that thelargest ones get their own buildings. And they are pricey. The fastestAmerican machine is ""Titan"" (at ORNL). BTW: the difference betweenthese machines and the data centers of Google, Facebook and the likesis that a supercomputer is built to tackle gigantic, monolithiccompute problems. Data centers process myriads of relatively small andindependent computations.

But why do we build these insanely expensive machines? Mostly forsimulations. Supercomputers are the reason we no longer nuke south seaisland to test new weapon designs. The car you're driving likelycompleted its first crash tests in a supercomputer. The project we'reworking on seeks to accurately model coastal inundation caused byheavy storms. Evacuating an area as large and populated as the NewOrleans metropolitan area costs hundreds of millions of dollars. Notevacuating it may cost thousands of lives. Not a decision to makelight-heartedly!

Most movies don't get science. Disruptive results are rarely achievedby a lone Sheldon Cooper, but by interdisciplinary teams -- withspecialists for every aspect of the endeavor. On our team we havecoastal engineers, mathematicians, and computer scientists. My job isto shield the others from the complexity of supercomputers.

Now, I wrote something about abstract thinking and how it's sometimeshard to pen ideas down. That's got to do with programming. Computerprograms are very much like recipes. A recipe is a set of instructionsthat describe how to transform ingredients into a desired output (e.g.pizza). Instead of ingredients a program operates on data. Theproblem: a computer operates like a very daft, yet accurate person.You will need to describe every action in great detail and it willfollow all of your instructions right down to the letter -- butwithout understanding the greater goal, and without ever correctingany of your errors. Supercomputers add quite a deal of complexity tothis job. To keep the picture of the kitchen intact: think you're notinstructing one cook to make one pizza, nor thousands of chefs toproduce thousands of pizzas, but your goal is to make ten thousandchefs prepare a single pizza in 0.01% of the usual time. In perfectcoordination.

E-mail me if you've got questions on supercomputers or would like toknow more about the STORM project (alternatively google for ""STORM ADCIRC Stellar"").

I am on this list for a very, very long time, but I never thought I'd win, and I never thought it would be that hard to write this post, so this is just a small collection of some thoughts:

Always have fun in what you are doing, if you don't have fun anymore do something different, even if it is hard to change. It has worked for me (until now, I'm 44) really well.

Live is easy, enjoy it. Really, it is easy!

I love the quote ""Stupid, but smart!"" from architect Rem Koolhaas when he described a part of one of his building. I think it fits my life quite good.

Be a news junkie. Be informed what happens in the world, it is our world!

That gets varied responses—people don’t understand why if I’m smart enough to attend such a school I study something that won’t get me very rich. So my answer is usually “I’m majoring in theatre, with a minor in marrying for money.”

But I don’t blame people for judging my decision. The industry is oversaturated with talent as it is. Just today, I saw an incredible play which featured 28 incredibly accomplished professional actors who were paid nowhere near a living wage. They all have to work day jobs, and then come to this tiny theatre, get into costume and makeup crammed in this tiny room, and then pour their hearts and souls into this beautiful play, go home, get some sleep, and go back to the daily grind. And these are some of the (relatively) successful. There are ways to work around this: apart from the obvious getting a big break and miraculously being able to support yourself in the theatre, there are many people whose day jobs involve working administration for larger theaters in town that require full-time staff. But no matter what, the work isn’t easy.

My parents both have sensible careers, but they fully supported me going into the arts. My dad works in sales for a software company and says he hasn’t enjoyed his work in well over a decade. He told me he didn’t care what career I pursue as long as I don’t hate what I have to do to put food on the table.

They say if you can picture yourself doing anything other than working in the theatre, do it. Only the people who can’t do anything else will have the drive to succeed. Well, when I was a freshman in high school, I saw a production of A Chorus Line, and after each character explained their reasons for pursuing such an unreliable career, they all joined in on the song “What I Did For Love,” and I started to cry, and I thought, “Oh, no. I think I have to do this.”

I’m a freshman in college now, and I recently opened my first show as an assistant director. Sitting in the audience at the performances, watching a group of people respond to and be moved by a piece that I helped create (while also taking pleasure in watching the show) was incredibly thrilling. I have seen hundreds of plays in my life, and I love the excitement of seeing a great story being told by real people in front of me—the presence of living humans creates an immediacy and an honest connection that isn’t present in any other medium. And I love when I can give that thrill to other people. I don’t know what I would do without that in my life. So, I may have a choice, but it’s a very obvious one. I’ll do what I have to do to make it work.

And now I’d like to give shoutouts to Adam and Michaela, two lovely theatre people who introduced me to the listserv.

I now urge you all to go see a play!

He was the most amazing, kind-hearted man I have ever known. And definitely was my biggest fan. 

No farewell words were spoken, no time to say goodbye. It happened so quickly, I didn't think it was real. 

I miss his laugh.

Fitting that I should win now, instead of during the initial honeymoon phase.

I do remember that the Listserve entries that stuck with me the most were the ones that introduced something new to my life, whether it was sharing the life story of someone different, a passionate cause I hadn’t heard of, or even just a good book recommendation.

So that’s what I’ll do here - tell my story, share recommendations, and end with a bad joke.

I grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley, surrounded by the kids of dotcom millionaires and Stanford professors. This was all I ever knew, so I came to think the pervasive innovative/technologist thinking was the global norm, and it was only after living in Europe during college that I realized how special the San Francisco Bay Area is. I learned more in that year of travel than I ever did in a classroom, about the world and where I wanted to fit into it. I fell in love with entrepreneurship and writing, and resolved to pursue both, by writing regularly and immersing myself in startups.

After returning home I led the family effort to self-publish a book: Life is A Game: Group Games for Kids, Teens, and Adults. Buy it at 101groupgames dot com if you need answers to the question of  ‘I dunno, what do YOU want to do?’. Writing that book was easy for our playful family, but like the SV upbringing, it’s not all universal.

I still believe that’s a fundamental truth - time spent playing with friends is some of the best time you can spend. That said, I have ambitions to accomplish something lasting and important in my life, so the happiness/significance dichotomy is one I struggle with. Would love to hear how you confront it in your life, if you're willing to share.

Right now I’m building a startup called Mailtime, a mobile messenger app built on top of email (think of Whatsapp’s easy interface but without its closed platform, mailtime dot com), interviewing entrepreneurs about daily habits  (info at habitualhustler dot com), and blogging weekly on tech, life hacks, and fun at coreybreier dot com.

If any of that struck a chord with you please do reach out!

Book recommendations:

Shantaram by David Gregory Roberts - semi autobiographical story of a Aussie criminal who escaped and built a new life for himself in the slums of Mumbai. Every traveler’s favorite book.

Black Hole Focus: How Intelligent People Can Create a Purpose For Their Lives by Isaiah Hankel - PhD realized he would hate being an academic, set out to find what he really wants, and provides an incredibly actionable/inspirational road map for you to do the same. The only self development book you need to read.

Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Eliezer Yudkowsky - HP fan fiction written by one of the foremost minds in artificial intelligence. Harry is raised by a biochemist to be the ultimate rationalist scientist, and sets out to figure out magic, with fascinating results. Great narrative and intro to rationality.

And the bad joke:

A man takes his dog to the vet for a routine checkup, and paces the waiting room getting increasingly worried as the ordeal takes longer than usual. Finally the vet comes out carrying the dog and says ‘Sir, I’m sorry but I’m going to have to put your dog down.’

‘WHAT?! Why, she was perfectly healthy this morning!’

‘…She’s just too heavy.”

And a favorite location of local bees are the plants and trees surrounding our home. We recently caught several swarms that we relocated to our Florida Bee Farm. Honey bees are fascinating and I love sitting outside their hives watching them come and go.Last night the leader of our local beekeeping group said she just found several of her hives with most of the bees dead inside and on the ground. Something to consider when thinking of spraying your plants with pesticides which may get carried back to bee colonies.

Our Florida Bee Farm is an acre of land with a small house and a beautiful Banyan tree where we grow organic fruits, vegetables and flowers. The garden shed is solar powered and runs an irrigation system dispensing captured rain water. Bees even have their own flower garden. Building things, growing plants and interacting with nature is good for the soul. There's a goat, butterflies, birds, bee hives and the magic cat. When the magic cat was a kitten she was taken by a hawk into the air and dropped. Her back was cut by the hawk's talons and patched by a neighbor with superglue. To this day you can't pet her back but hawks leave her alone.

With all our advanced technology why don't pharmaceutical companies develop cures for chronic illness instead of only drugs to control symptoms? Because they're in business to make money.

When I was 30 I contracted severe chronic asthma and for many years struggled to breathe despite seeing many doctors. They all told me I would have asthma forever, always needing expensive drugs and inhalers. My asthma was often out of control and I almost died several times. A pharmacist friend found research by Dr. David Hahn in Wisconsin relating severe asthma to the bacteria Chlamydia pneumoniae (cp). I contacted Dr. Hahn and used his long term antibiotic treatment to eradicate the bacteria. A year later I was 100% cured and still am 20 years later. It was a miracle after years of suffering.

In 2002 I built the asthmastory website out of gratitude and to spread the word to help others get better. Originally, I naively believed Dr. Hahn's research would be a miraculous breakthrough and a cure derived from his research would soon be available to all. Despite researchers around the globe studying the asthma/cp link, a cure is still not offered within medical guidelines despite the fact that the method is not much different than a treatment doctors prescribe for acne. More research still needs to be done but as I get older I realize the only way it will ever be funded is if I win the lotto. Cp has been linked to heart disease and some think it could be the cause of ALS, MS, CFS, and Rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

The asthmastory website is dated and needs to be modernized to play better with mobile devices so I'm struggling with a complete overhaul and new design. Any tips appreciated.

Hug often and tell those close to you that you love them. The last thing we said and heard from our son Paul before he unexpectedly died was “love ya” and we exchanged hugs and said goodbye. You never know when that day will arrive.

Quick bio: Since graduating college in 2010, I traveled around some of Asia and Europe.  I've lived in Thailand, Georgia, and the Czech Republic.  I taught English to kids ages 3-25 at different points in time.  I came back to that states, got my real teaching certification in Texas, and began working as a Geography teacher at a high school - NOT what I expected.  Now I've just applied to online grad school to get my MBA.  

Goals: My original goal was to be a Foreign Service Officer with the Department of State working at some foreign embassy.  I thought I'd be doing that by now.  My current goal is the get my MBA, combine it with my BA of International Relations and work at some awesome non-profit organization, or big shot company that works internationally.  Keep travelling! 

I'm going to South America this summer. I realized it would be nearly 2 years since I've gone anywhere, and that just won't due.  I bought a ticket to Quito, Ecuador and this time I have a travel partner going with me!  It will be a short two week trip, but I'm SO excited to go! 

Final Rant: Public school of Texas will be the death of intelligence for the youths.  Between the curriculum, the testing, the constant nagging to try new tactics and requiring them to be present in every lesson, and not being able to tell kids they're being an absolute moron without getting in trouble, I just see a negative trend in education.  Not that telling a kid that they're being a moron will make them smarter, but it certainly helps make the job interesting.  *Please note the sarcasm about the moron part*.  

That's about all I've got.  Good Day!

I live near the Hague in a lovely old university town, but I grew up in California. Most years around this time of year my wife and I visit family in Maryland for what we call Camp Pesach. When I was younger, we'd celebrate Passover with my mother's parents, her three siblings, as many of our cousins in that part of the family who could make it (and as most lived on the east coast, this was really just an issue for my sister, my parents, and me). Last night over shabbat supper, my Aunt Karen recounted what was essentially my grandmother's dying wish, that we continue to gather as a family, and not slip away from one another. So each year, Bobe's four children, their spouses, her eight grandchildren and their spouses and children gather in a big house on Chesapeake Bay. It's 28 of us this, the 20th, year of Camp Pesach. (For a variety of reasons we're gathering a little early - we allow such concessions as we're gathering from two coasts, two continents, and three or four states now.)

Back in the early days of this celebration, my sister and I compiled a Haggadah (the book of prayers and stories and songs that make up the Passover seder) for the family in small ring binders so that we could add new material, family photos, and so forth. This year she asked me and my uncle Dana for poems to add. I gather that his runs to four pages, mine to 18 lines:

Wandering, we pitch our tent again,Gathering, our clan, about the flames,Reclining, kings and queens, before the feast.

Ancient histories and new,Far loved ones and near,Recount - It would have been enough,Shankbone, orange, and charoset,Blood and frogs and bitter herbs.Who knows one, I know one little goat.

We drove a stake into the desert(For we did these things,our grandparents, our aunts and cousins,Twenty generations back or twenty days.All at once, all of us)We poked a stick into the desert floor.

Taking root, a willow, branch and leaf,An oak, a spreading chestnut,Under which we spread our feast.-=-=-=

And some recommendations:I blog irregularly about politics and music on WordPress at JoeJots.Music: In the moment, I'm listening to Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives and Hot Sevens which is some great early jazz.Literature: I'm rereading James Baldwin's Go Tell It On The Mountain which is one of my favourite novels.

I found a robot’s heart today. I didn’t think they still made robotswith hearts, but there it was, at the corner of Leary and Sycamore. Iteven looked like a heart: size of a fist, valves pulsing with paleching ching noises each time they opened and shut. The metal was oldand worn.

I took it home and plugged it into my computer. It had a few jumbledvideos—the way older robots used to store memories.

I sorted by number and began to watch.

The first video was in a warehouse. Lines of identical, still robots,presumably the same old-fashioned model as the one whose heart I’dfound. The field of vision jerked to the left and found another robotlooking straight at it. The other robot smiled, and glanced downwards.The camera followed it and saw the other robot’s hand clenched in afist. One, two, three times it bobbed the fist up and down, and thenextended two fingers. Rock, paper, scissors. The camera then capturedits own robot hand reaching forward to join the game. Scissors beatpaper. Paper beat rock. A wider robot smile. None of the other robotsmoved.

I clicked to the second video. Same warehouse. An operator in whiteQA-tested each robot. They all stayed very still. The robot to theleft flashed a silly face, and the camera jiggled in suppressedlaughter. The operator approached, and the camera snapped forward.

The next video was in a factory on a moving conveyer belt. The robotto the left was about to get tied into cushioned packaging. It alreadyhad the manual for “Personality-free Chore-Bot” nestled in its arms.It looked up and said, “Shouldn’t you buy me dinner before you tie meup?” The startled operator hit the alarm. Red flashing lights floodedthe factory floor, and a mechanical voice said “Faulty Chore-Bot.Remove for destruction.” As the robot to the left was removed, thecamera swiveled forward and was still.

The fourth video was in a living room. Children played on the carpetas a middle-aged couple unpacked the robot. “This should be theperfect model for us,” said the man. “None of that personality modulenonsense. It can start by keeping the deer away from the tomato patch.Go on now, go outside.” The camera swung from the door to thechildren, who were playing rock, paper, scissors, then back to thedoor and headed out.

I hoped I wouldn’t see the man disassembling the robot in a later video.

The next several videos were in the garden, in different seasons. Thecamera patrolled around the tomatoes. Sometimes heavy and ripe,sometimes hard green buds. Sometimes the camera would look through theback door, like it was waiting for a glimpse of the playing kids.Sometimes, the man would shoo it away. I scanned through these prettyquickly.

I clicked to the last video, which was in the garden at night. Nothingto guard against. The robot’s hands went through the motions. Rock,paper, scissors. Rock, paper, scissors. Over and over, until finally,the camera looked down and the hands unscrewed the robot’s breastplateand reached in. The video went blank.

I unplugged the heart and took it to the workbench in my garage. Idusted off my spare chassis and brought it over. The heart looked likeit would fit inside perfectly. My daughter always loved Rock PaperScissors.

We were inspired by a “social study” that we read about in the NY Times, titled To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This. In the study, two strangers are placed in a room and ask each other a series of increasingly personal questions. We decided to try it out for ourselves.

Two enlightening & emotional hours later, we reached the final question of the study:

‘Share a personal problem and ask your partner’s advice on how he or she might handle it.’

I felt a lump in my throat grow as I tried to verbalize the thoughts whose only other location have been at the back of my mind.

“I think I have a good life… and for the most part I do what I want that makes me happy… but it feels like there’s always something in my brain that feels… trapped. It’s telling me to do more, explore more, be more…I almost feel like I can’t breathe…but I don’t know what to do about it.”

My heart raced in fear of expressing so much vulnerability. He gave me a quite notable response, as follows:

I see life like a nightclub. There’s the main entrance, where you wait in line, along with 99% of the other people trying to get into the club, and hope that the bouncer chooses you to get in. The second entrance is for privileged people, who get in because they’re celebrities etc. What most people don’t realize is that there’s a third way inside…

The third way is leaving the long line and running through the alley, banging on the back door, sneaking through the windows, doing anything you can to enter.  The scariest part; however, is not going through this unfamiliar territory, but rather leaving the main line that you have already been waiting in for so long.…

The main entrance is the line that I have been in my entire life, and it seems most of society is there too.

I am a 21-year-old business student, and until recently, I have been in this line- waiting patiently in line to enter the nightclub. My future plans consisted of securing a “respectable” internship for the summer that would turn into a practical full time job, graduating school on time, and having my career laid out for me. That’s true happiness… right?I am slowly learning that the “I’m trapped” voice in the back of my head doesn’t believe that’s the right way to go...

Today, as I write this email, I have just arrived to an unfamiliar hotel, in a strange town, with someone who, yesterday, was merely an old acquaintance, but now is a friend. He convinced me to “get out of line” and go on an unknown adventure with him.So here I am, ditching class during the week  (which I never do), taking a spontaneous trip to an unknown town (which I never do), feeling scared, nervous, and excited, but mostly free. I’ve decided to take some time off of school, make my own adventures, and find what makes me feel permanently free. (Any suggestions?!)

I guess in my own, small-scaled, cheesy way, this morning I decided to run out of the line and into the alley, in search of the third entrance.

I want to start by telling you that you are loved.

I don’t know what your life is like right now, nor do I need to.  The only thing you need to know is that despite what you may be thinking, you are most definitely loved, appreciated, and treasured. You matter.

When I saw “You’ve won the Listserve!” in my inbox, I thought how clever an idea it was to punk 25,000 people by having that as a Listserve submission. Then I opened the mail and realized – holy mackerel, I actually won The Listserve!

No pithy life advice, no memoirs, just a clarion call for others out there like me.

I was born in Asia and spent all my life there before living 18 months in the States on a study abroad-cum-internship program. I vowed early on that I would not do the FOB thing and thus embraced arms-open lips-puckered all that the beautiful state of Washington had to offer me: its people, its culture, its eternal rain.

The result of all those months engaging Americana? A blended accent, blended enough that people in my country of origin believe I sound American, while I and other Americans know it’s a little right of center at best.

Have you ever lived somewhere for a long time, had your accent evolve, and then come back to a society that judges you for it?

Anyone who has been abroad for extended periods will know that accent shifts happen naturally, and, sometimes, irreversibly. Some maintain the ability to code switch between their evolved and original accents; others can’t. I belong to the latter.

I hold no shame for my blended accent; the way we speak is an integral part of our personality and I’ve become a more outspoken, confident person as a result. I thoroughly embrace it as a part of me that has changed and evolved with the experiences I’ve opened myself to. But many people in my country don’t see it that way: I’ve had revulsion, confusion, and mockery for “trying to change my accent” because I can’t code-switch back.

I’m an egotistical douchebag so I usually don’t let it get to me, but I would be lying if I said I’ve been totally impervious to some of the things I’ve heard. You don’t realize how personal your accent is until you spend days in a slump because someone gave you crap for the way you speak.

The odd part of this is that I have good days, where I mentally occupy the same space I did while living in the States and am suave charismatic and eloquent, and really off days where I exist in an obfuscating limbo where I struggle to say even the most basic of sentences and become a blubbering mess.  It is something I have no control over and it’s given me anxiety in both my personal and professional life. Sometimes it is limiting when I want to express myself and am unable to say it in a manner congruent with my manner of speech. Cognitive dissonance in the extreme?

My plea – I want to hear from others like me. Maybe you were judged for having an evolved accent, or perhaps you too lost your ability to code switch and you share my struggle of good/off days. Send me an email. I want to connect with you.

Or perhaps you’re a speech pathologist and can diagnose the above-mentioned problem. If so, I really really want to hear from you.

Or maybe you’re someone in the US looking for an extremely capable and talented individual willing to work his butt off at whatever cost. I’m an honors graduate, 2 years in the banking industry with easily transplantable skills a fervent desire to follow my destiny and work in the US. Hire me!

In rare moments I become aware, deep in my bones or at least somewhere that is not in my brain, of a fundamental truth so overwhelmingly important that it really should derail me: the fact that we are meaningless; that there is this something called ""existence"" here floating around, and that I and everyone around me is constructed haphazardly and magnificently out of this something for no particular or general reason, an accident of time and fundamental forces and particles being pushed together/apart. This is a realization of the fact that we are not only nothing but in fact a nothing that is utterly crushed by itself, meaningless on a cosmological scale that dwarfs all of our daily actions and routines.

These moments sometimes come to me on the packed train in to work, cramped into a tiny space with far too many other people, all of us silently and conspicuously traveling together toward presumed lives we are leading. I want to ask the other people, right there on the subway car, whether they have considered on introspective nights the same questions I have, whether they have asked themselves to what end they find themselves here or anywhere, whether they are aware that they will eventually be utterly forgotten. We will be forgotten on both the cosmological scale, as a simple bizarre occurrence in a universe of matter that has no special place for such statistical anomalies; but we will also be forgotten by our own people, with the exception of a few chosen for remembrance past their lifetimes. (Consider how much you know about any one of your 64 great-great-great-great grandparents, and you’ll have an idea of whether any of your descendants will remember you 150-200 years from now.) I wonder if the other people on the train know this, whether any of them are, like I am, struggling with how we respond to and move beyond this understanding, how we can learn to be conscious of this and still reconcile our hopes and goals and bills to pay and I-need-to-pick-up-milk’s. How many of the train-riders have never considered it; how many are in denial; how many have found the personal answers that work for them?

I believe we can find some grand peace in accepting the universe in its simple being-ness (who could blame it?), and that Buddhist and other similar worldviews are all about tackling these issues. But still I have not left my day job and my hobbies, and still my mind wanders for large stretches away from these major issues. I want to teach myself to incorporate these thoughts into my waking daily interactions with the universe, but I’m not there yet. And that’s okay, for now.

I’m working my way toward it, and I know others are on parallel paths. So I guess I just want to say: hi! to the other little pockets of self-awareness out there. And to say that for now I take comfort in the perhaps-naïve thought that there is some power in saying “no!” to the infinite nothing, that we all still have the agency to say “I will continue to read my books and learn to draw and get to work on time, and if the universe wants to belittle me it can go f**k itself because I’m doing it anyway”, and maybe we can find truth in that simple decision to exist consciously. Or at least we can have some fun doing it.

Three months ago, I left my job. My “big” west coast tech company job. I started to feel like I was getting further and further away from my dream and that scared me. I was tired. Tired of the company and the culture it fostered. Against family and friend’s persistent advice, I left without another job lined up.

I wanted to travel, I wanted to spend some time detached and thinking about my next move and I wanted to see family and friends. I needed to see family and friends. It was an incredible month. I visited San Francisco, San Diego, New York, Philadelphia, Ann Arbor and finally, home. Oh man, was it good to be home…

My mini hiatus ends…I head back to Seattle with a choice: Move forward or else. I remember my first morning back, feeling a pit in my stomach, thinking, “Ok, this is it. Its time to make something happen.” I started creatively applying to companies, trying to get in the door, trying to get an interview. Simultaneously, I started working through this thought: Why are some businesses so far behind with technology and operations and how do they survive?

Both moved slow, but forward nonetheless. I received a few interviews and the thought turned into a project that I called On To Space. I realized that many businesses across the country need help migrating parts of their business online and using technology tools and platforms but just don’t know where to go or what to ask. I plan to use On To Space to help those businesses, those people. My goal is to open my lines of communication and welcome businesses to reach out to start the conversation about questions and problems, big and small. Through this project, I have really started to believe that most the solutions are out there; they just need to be presented more efficiently.

I am excited for whatever comes next. I am just a Midwestern kid from Youngstown, OH trying to figure it out. I’d love to hear your story and welcome any advice on my situation and project.

This is an incredible community and I am proud to be a part of it.

All the best.

        The things I ""know something about"" are mostly related to communication, which I taught (at KU), and which I enjoy applying--as a volunteer--to a wide range of activities.  If these activities interest you, too, I'll suggest some Google terms to check out (no specific links allowed on the ListServe).  They include:

        a) Offering classes and workshops in our local (Yavapai College) Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI), sometimes on communication-related topics, but also on  other themes that interest me (1-2 per term).   (For example, this year it's been ""Transpartisan Dialogue,"" ""Stories in Thought and Talk,"" ""The Best of TED Talks,""  ""Creativity in Everyday Life,""  and ""Broadening and Deepening Mindfulness."" )   (Google ""ollisedonaverde"") 

        b) Facilitating this summer at OLLI: 1) a ""Shakespeare Festival"" - we'll watch, at each session, a PBS video and  discuss a few powerful soliloquies from each play (Google: ""PBS Shakespeare Uncovered"") and 2) ""Big History""  - we'll watch and discuss David Christian's curriculum, funded by Bill Gates.  (Google:  ""Big History Project"")      

        c) Coordinating a community mediation program that offers free assistance to local residents in resolving disputes they can't work out on their own.  (Google:  ""City of Sedona Mediation Services"")

        d) Holding programs and discussions that bring together people across the political spectrum--using the ""Living Room Conversations"" process, and setting a ""world record"" by hosting 21 LRC programs around town during October, 2014.   (Google: ""Sedona Living Room Conversations on Vimeo"")     

        e) Helping our city government implement a new civic engagement program.  (Google:  ""Sedona Citizen Engagement Program"")

        f) Helping to coordinate a ""24-Hour Theater"" program once a year, in which Sedona writers, directors, actors, set designers, and song writers, create and stage four 10-minute plays within a 24-hour period.  (Google: ""24 Hour Theater in Sedona, AZ on Vimeo"")         g) Facilitating classes at our local synagogue using instructional materials created by The Teaching Company (Google: ""The Great Courses"" ).  Also, writing, directing, and performing in an annual musical version of the ""Purim"" story, each year inserting different pop, Broadway, etc. songs throughout.   (Google: ""Sedona JCSVV"")         h) Contributing to a local group I helped start, called ""Integral Sedona,"" based on the ideas of Ken Wilber.  (Google: ""Integral Sedona"") 

        i) Serving, over the past ten years, as a ""Destination Speaker"" on about a dozen cruise ship itineraries.  (Google: ""Sixth Star Entertainment"")

March 2015,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/03/19/5-things-2-questions/,"March 2015, 19","5 things, 2 questions","1: I'm the only oldest (old-ER, even) child in my entire immediate family– my mom, dad, brother, and all four grandparents are the youngest children in their families. Call me indecisive, call me a walking contradiction, but growing up as an Oldest surrounded by Youngests has given me a weird set of ways.

2: Most of the time, I'm walking the fuzzy line that separates a lot of things: homebody/socializer, independent/needy, afraid/confident, friendly/awkward, thinker/doer. And a lot more. I took an enneagram personality test once (I'm a type Six) that summed it up perfectly: No matter what is said about a Six, the opposite is often true.

3: Moms. My favorite thing about mine is that I didn't even realize until I left for college that a lot of the words she uses aren't… common? The first time I referred to a pilling sweater as ""nubby,"" it was obvious my family's vocabulary didn't match most people's. My grandma used to call our cat a ""britzer,"" which is not a thing, so I know where my mom gets it from. It's very endearing.

4: Small towns can be so charming! They have a story, a past, and their inhabitants are there to tell you about it. Antique store owners, volunteer firefighters, things like the annual Strawberry Festival, that cat that's always around– they're the heart and soul of the place.

5: I've been working for a fair trade clothing company for two years now, but I'll admit that before I started, I easily forgot that humans make clothing. Hands made what you're wearing right now. Fingers pushed that seam through a sewing machine, and with International Women's Day right around the corner, wouldn't you like to know that those fingers belong to a woman who's paid fairly and works in a safe environment? And can in turn provide for her family? The fair trade community is the small town of the garment industry– search for Mata Traders and you'll see what I mean.

But enough about me: if you want to tell me 1 or, hey, even 2 of the following things, email me at I want to know:

1: Your favorite small towns (and why). I grew up in one and I want to visit more– international small towns appreciated, as long as they'll welcome me.

2: Your favorite thing about your mom. Also accepted: a specific story OR over-arching great-thing about your mom OR grandma, aunt, friend, doesn't matter. I like focusing on the good parts of people and I'd love to hear what you have to say about a lady in your life.

Let me back up... I started a small winery with my two best friends. It was amazing...at first. Then, it became apparent that one had to go. (See also: stealing, lying, over all assery).

A couple years later, at a point when we were at our most successful, our investors decided... along with my best friend and co-founder, to vote me out. (See also: Greed)

So then why am I so lucky, well dear friends, and I do truly mean dear friends, because I read each and every one of these emails with care and great admiration.I am so lucky because I hit the surprise, unplanned, genetic lottery, without which I might not have survived the last year. (See also: Charlotte June, we call her Charlie)

Last August, I received a text, from a friend that I worked with at a restaurant who I hadn't heard from in over a year. The exact words escape me but the gist was, I think you should take a paternity test. (See also: One, and I do mean one, lonely night a few years ago we went out, had some drinks and 20 some odd months later this text.)

The next few weeks were a blur of worry and shame and searching. But I took the test. The results; father hood. I wrote an email to my family (except my parents, I flew home to tell them) explaining the circumstances. I would like to share an excerpt from that email: 'I want to thank everyone and anyone reading this, whether I sent it to you, or someone close that we share forwarded it as requested for your love and support during my life. You all are the reason why I feel comfortable enough as a human to bestow all that I am and have learned on another little person. I know my life is now drastically different and each day will come with a new challenge whether small, like now answering my phone ""Hi, Aunt Laura,"" instead of cousin Laura, or coordinating the sleep schedule of a toddler in advance of a cross-country trek to Northern Indiana in the dead of summer. I invite you all to join in on the conversation, and feel free to ask me absolutely anything without reservation, as this will in some way, small or large, affect you all now as well.'

The next day, I picked her up, started an Instagram to chronicle the journey (all of you are invited to join in: @cjsilliman) and began to learn everything Charlie had to teach me.

So why share this intimate and possibly embarrassing story with 25,000 strangers? (Except for you Lex Friedman, I've heard your voice for years) Because I want you all to know that you are only given what you can handle, and I really can't stress that enough. You are strong enough to conquer what you are faced with, what you have been dealing with, what ails you and keeps you up at night. Just the fact that you are here, reading this, means you care, means you strive for something more, and new and different. And life doesn't give a shit about your plans, and it shouldn't. Because you can't plain perfection, and I honestly believe that's what you are and life is.

Thanks for taking the time and welcome to the family. Go follow her journey, and mine.

Thank you (See also: I love you)

I am 28 years old and I was born in Maryland, USA. I studied Criminal Justice at Penn State University and graduated in 2008. Then I spent my early 20's living abroad in Spain, China, Argentina, and Brazil. Three years ago I settled in San Francisco, California and became an English teacher.

I would liken my (or, the ubiquitous) first year teaching experience to learning how to swim by method of being chucked mercilessly into a frigid, choppy, bottomless ocean. And as you drift away, excited to learn or just terrified, you’re not sure which, you barely hear the last words of encouragement you’re going to hear in what will feel like eternities: ""Swimming's easy! You'll figure it out eventually! Careful not to drown first! And watch out for the Sharks!”

The students call me Mr. Hurwitz and I hear my name ALL day – both a point of pride and an enormous burden.

I teach 6th grade English at a large public middle school in Oakland, California. Monday through Friday from 8am to 3pm, I'm in a classroom with 32 11 and 12 year olds. Right now we're reading The Giver by Lois Lowry and we are loving it. We read a couple chapters together, then we discuss, or we write, or both. Rinse and repeat. For the complete recipe, add:

-Google Chromebooks and nifty educational websites (Schoology, Flocabulary, Quizlet, NoRedInk, TypingClub)

-stickers, stamps, and letter grades

-handwriting practice (seriously, every now and then, they LOVE it)

-music (we bump Spotify in class whenever possible)

-physical movement (A LOT)

-SSR (Sustained Silent Reading, 27 minutes every day after lunch)

and of course...

-laughs, smiles, tears, bandaids, ungodly amounts of kleenex and hand sanitizer, pencil shavings and eraser crumbs, and forgotten sweatshirts

To me, the best part about being a teacher is feeling needed so much...

... By all the students, who need knowledge and discipline and fun and praise and love and support and empathy in order to grow into healthy, happy adults who serve their community.

... By the single student, one in tears because her backpack and lunch bag stolen were from her locker, or one who has trouble making friends, or one who wants me to help her with the book she wrote, or even one who just needs attention so bad because no one at home hugs him, so he stomps around the classroom.

... By a parent, who shows up to my classroom on the verge of tears 45 minutes after I message her to say that her son, who I know well, isn’t focusing in class and is directing some disrespectful language towards me.

... By my colleagues, with whom I share the same students who excel, the same students who struggle, the same physical space, the same lesson plans, the same passion for exhausting and challenging and fulfilling work, the same coffee, and the same Professional Development sessions.

... And by the Oakland community- rich in diversity and natural beauty, but generally malnourished and segregated- which needs role models for its youth.

As a teacher, when I feel needed, I feel honored. When I satisfy other's needs, I feel confident. When I handle a situation with the utmost positivity and conscientiousness and empathy, I feel proud, free even. When I fail or flounder or treat another poorly, I feel deep remorse and embarrassment and frustration.

I'd really like to say thank you for reading, truly. I invite you to respond to my words. As an introvert the most exciting part of writing my own Listserve post is not the opportunity to say something to 24,000 people all over the world, but to hear something back from just a small fraction of them. I'm always in appreciation of others' perspectives, candor, solidarity, and constructive feedback.

Peace and Love, Adam.

Like many former winners, I thought long and hard these last 36 hours about what to write. I considered:

… Trying to express why I think it’s so important for human beings to continually and consciously attempt to think at scales that are beyond (unassisted) human perception—atoms, global warming, space—while at the same time accepting (even taking a certain kind of pleasure in? well, I do, at least) our limits … That’s why I love movies like Tree of Life and Melancholia that either jump-cut between the mundane events of a single human life and, say, the surface of the sun -or- require something crazily vast to tell a story like a rogue planet about to crash into the earth. Or books like Climate Changed: A Personal Journey through the Science (graphic novel) or a poem like “Unnamed Dragonfly Species” by Juliana Spahr (she’s amazing) in which her singular speaker, referred to using the pronoun “they,” sit(s) at a computer night after night obsessively watching videos of glaciers collapsing and trying—failing—to turn their confused feelings into knowledge or action… Anyway, I think ethical action lives in these limits. Not fully knowing. Failing to totally see and not letting that stop you. I don’t know.

… Writing about my mom, who is one of the dearest people to me on this earth. Smart, funny, kind to everybody, and possessed of a truly weird sense of humor, which she insists is not weird. Trust me, it is: and I love her all the more for that.

… Writing about my two sisters, who, also loving and courageous and smart and weird, are dear to me in the same way.

…  Confessing to 25,000 people how—and this relates to my first point!—how my tendency to engage in what is called “catastrophic thinking” makes me worry perhaps too much, too often about the deaths of people closest to me. All my recurrent anxiety dreams are either large-scale disasters (tsunamis, planes falling from the sky) or something mortally bad happening to my younger sister.

So those are the things I thought about writing about. But then I decided, rather than anguish at my computer for way too long, I’d rather sit outside in the warm sun and read a book. So, Listserve, that’s what I’m going to do!

A few parting thoughts:- I work for an amazing organization called The Nonhuman Rights Project. We are working through U.S. common law to achieve the recognition of actual legal rights for great apes, elephants, dolphins, and whales. If you think nonhuman animals who have been scientifically proven to be self-aware and autonomous don’t belong in captivity and shouldn’t be considered merely legal property, please check out the NhRP’s work!

- My older sister is a chef in Philly. If you’re around, go eat at South Bowl!

- Nick: I love you! I can’t imagine life without you.

- Ramón: I haven’t forgotten to send you a postcard!

- From Anna Karenina: “Lying on his back he was now gazing at the high cloudless sky. ‘Don't I know that this is infinite space, and not a rounded vault? But however I may screw my eyes and strain my sight, I can not help seeing it round and limited, and despite my knowledge of it as limitless space, I am indubitably right when I see a firm blue vault, and more right than when I strain to see beyond it.”

Thanks, everyone, and take care!

You swam in the palm of bright salty life

With peppery eyes and long waving tails

But this life that so seemed to hold you securely

The dark grasp of death now against it prevails

Dull are your eyes that once glimmered faintly

And held the whole world in your minuscule view

Still are your tails that once waved so freely

And black are the waters that sparkled so blue

Death’s cold iron talons caught you and held you

In the small violent waves and the algae and foam

But the water that carried you now will receive you

In the calm starry waves may you find yourself home

At least that's what the campus librarian insisted when she reviewed the website I worked on for her university. I had done research on just this issue, proving that over 90% of college students I asked could identify what the floppy disk meant. And though I beamed with excitement as I showed her this data, it wasn't enough. New students are always coming in, she said, much younger than the ones I polled. So I went back and surveyed 526 high schoolers to find out definitively: Do teenagers understand the outdated tech in our icons? 

The survey says yes. 91% of the high school students were able to identify the icon as a floppy disk. And 91% knew that when they saw that icon on a computer screen, clicking it would save their work. 

Case closed, right? Nope. Despite this research, I still hear about web designers who think the floppy disk icon should be retired. They claim that younger computer users (kids who have never seen a floppy disk) won't understand it. 

But beyond my research, the English language also proves this to be wrong. There are tons of words that relate to retired tech. For instance, when you copy someone on an email, you're using the ""carbon copy"" function. Have you ever used carbon paper? Probably not. But you get what cc: means. Ever ""hang up"" a call on your iPhone? Does it involve anything actually hanging? No. Phones used to physically hang, but new models don't. And yet, you understand. It makes sense because our written language has evolved over time, and now our visual language is evolving too. 

So let's leave the floppy disk icon unscathed. At least for now. Every time I've clicked it, it's saved my work. It never complained about being tired or sick. It's been a faithful and true friend. One that I will defend for as long as I can. (Or until research shows it doesn't make sense anymore...)

Thanks for reading!

I have research about this and 10 other common icons. Get in touch if you're interested in hearing more, or if you'd like me to talk about this at your upcoming tech or design conference. Together, we can save the floppy disk icon from extinction!

2. The Mindvourers’ only source of food is brains – brains of the kind found for example in all vertebrates and most invertebrate animals on earth.

3. Around the time they ran out of food sources on their home planet the Mindvourers came up with a cunning plan – a “fertilizer” for organic brain tissue that could be distributed across the universe with the goal to grow underdeveloped organic brain tissue into super brains.

4. Super brains would eventually convince the host body (like for example us humans) to build vessels and fly to the Mindvourers’ planet

5. Upon arrival the super brains will be consumed through quick and easy suction into the vortex shaped four-leggers.

Notes:* The vortex shaped aliens can reverse the flow of their vortexes. This way they are able to create things. What mechanism exists within the vortexes to make this work I have not yet discovered.* The vessels to distribute the fertilizer are all around us. Human scientists currently call this dark matter.

Brains are evil.

Ergo, stop thinking about this too much. You are just adding fuel to the brainy fire.

I lost my father this past September. I lost my only sibling, my brother, in November 2010. He was only 46. My dad, 69. I just turned 46 and I’m mildly freaked out that I will die this year - just because, yanno, my brother went at this age. It’s one of those irrational thoughts that occasionally crosses my mind and decides to sit there for a while to see how I will react. It would be one thing if I lived my brothers life style, but I don’t and if there is anything my father taught me, it was to take care of my body and pay attention to the signs it gives me. He did not. He suffered. A lot. It was painful to watch, but how could I not? At least I could be there for him when he needed me. And he did need me - and that felt good. When he died, I was by his side, holding his hand. He went peacefully. My brother left with no warning and, maybe because he was the first closest to me to die, I miss him terribly.

I used to suffer and worry over things like this, constantly. I used to be the doormat in relationships. I used to second guess myself and where my outward appearance showed confidence, I was a complete mess inside. I always considered myself a victim. That someone or something did me wrong when all I was trying to do was do the right thing, be loved by someone, love as much as I could, help everyone and just be someone to someone. What was wrong with that? It seemed no one understood me. So I suffered. Constantly. My biggest question to myself, that I always asked myself when I was crying because I was so misunderstood was ‘Why?’. Why me? Why now? Why this? Why that?

Really, who cares why? There is a meme on the internet:Do you have a problem? Yes. Can you do something about it? Yes. Then why worry?Do you have a problem? Yes. Can you do something about it? No. Then why worry?Do you have a problem? No. Then why worry?

I became aware of my own thinking(worrying) and that I was unaware that the contribution of my thinking(worrying) was my suffering. This is what’s called being attached. Attached to ideas and notions about how I think things should be instead of simply accepting things as how they are... good, bad or indifferent.

Why worry? Why suffer? Why think about the future, why think about the past? I learned through suffering that it was necessary to let go of why. The only way to do that, for me, was meditation. Meditation helped me understand that if I think about anything other than RIGHT NOW, it brings worry. It also does not allow you to be present with yourself and those around you. You also miss everything. EVERYTHING. It also breeds resentment, and anger, and sadness and suffering and nervousness and anxiety and torment.

Live for RIGHT NOW. Think for RIGHT NOW…. this present moment, the only moment we will ever have.

Sean Williams is a #1 New York Times-bestselling novelist. He or she is also an ethnomusicologist, a social media manager for Hyundai, an electronic musician, a police officer who shot a 22-year old man for no good reason, a basketballer, a cricketer, a comic book writer who lives in the Spam capital of the US, and many other things.

Can you guess which one I am?

As a kid I decided that “Jonathan Silver” was what I would change my name to when I grew up, because that sounded like a good name for a cowboy. This was before I read Treasure Island.

When I made my first professional sale, it was under my best friend’s name. At the last minute I decided to use my own instead, and have continued doing so for the rest of my career.

My mother says that I was named after James Bond, and my father, whose surname I share, was fond of his roots (something I call “Welsh-fulfilment”). Neither is enough to make me comfortable with the name I was christened.

And yet . . .

In Dutch there’s a word for people who have the same name: “naamgenoot”, which works similarly to “housemate” or “classmate” in English. I enjoy finding my namemates and making contact with them and/or buying their books to confuse my friends. It feels obscurely like tracking down parts of myself who have become dispersed through time and space, like the fragments of a being too vast for a single ordinary life, a being that can only be partially glimpsed by its component parts, thanks to search engines.*

This idea appeals to me. My mind is full of such things. And twins, for some reason.

It seems to me that I’ve spent most of my professional life seeking a profound truth regarding identity or selfhood that we desperately need to grasp if we’re going to survive the curse of history (i.e. to repeat it). I suspect that this truth is in part an obvious one, that everyone searches for it, and that we’ve heard it many times here on the Listserve.

We need to be better. We need to be bigger. We need to be meaningfully connected to each other.

So why not, as an exercise, try connecting through names? Some find the idea diminishing that what we call ourselves is rarely unique. Me, the only thing diminished is my instinctive dislike of my name. If others share it, it can’t be that bad, right? Even the versions of me who made terrible mistakes or have grown up to be terrible people, they’re integral parts of the vast organism that is meta-Sean Williams. And he/she really appeals to me.

So if you’re another Sean Williams, drop me a line via the email below. It’ll be great to meet you, whoever you are. I’m also “adelaidesean” on Twitter. Together, let’s make the world a better place.

Or let’s take it over. One of the two.

Cheers,

Sean WilliamsAdelaide, South Australia

Always coffee.I order the same thing I order everyday from the same cute barista.

I feel cocksure, unstoppable, drunken - or greasy, fat, leprous, diseased.

There's a cloud blown across my mind, my calm. No clarity, it's all shouting, noise and clamour, or whispers that wake me at night, pulling out my muscles like old rope and making my back grind and squeal like icebergs colliding.

I'm waiting for a huge crack and half of me to slide off into the sea. I'm waiting for my coffee.I'm trying to sneak a futile glance at Sophie's rack while she makes it.

Is it being back home?

I want to run again, lost in the winds.Laughing down alleyways - the sounds falling out of me and cracking against stones and shuttered windows, yellow streetlights pooling in the dirty runoff of 2am.

I want to drink rum and spit spanish and blow smoke in some tiny apartment. Taste violet firewater, sweet on her tongue - pushing me against the kitchen bench, her hands fumbling with my belt buckle.

To hoist my ragged voice under unfamiliar stars on an unknown beach, to hurl songs into the waves, knowing I only have tonight here before I keep moving, and that I'll never be back. 

I want to breathe hashish and henna. To dance through snarling traffic, to fling money at snakes.To hear arabic curl it's way through the air like burning paper, and the watch the sun hang in the air like a ball of orange cream.

March 2015,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/03/06/making-friends/,"March 2015, 06",Making friends,"How do you make friends? 

It's something that people do all the time, and it amazes me. I'm no good at it -- never developed the knack, never developed the skills. 

I don't know how to become friends with someone.* 

I know it can be done -- people do it all the time! But I don't know how to do it myself.

Let me talk about me a little, so you'll have a better idea.

I'm autistic, of the high-functioning aspergers variety, which for me essentially means I don't really have an emotional/social language. Because of this, I've somehow managed to grow up** without developing empathy. I've managed to cobble together a working replacement; if I'm paying attention, actively thinking about it, I can see what people are feeling, how they're doing, but I have to stop and work it out. If I don't focus on it, because I'm distracted or because it's hard to remember to think about something all the time, I am blissfully unaware that people have feelings. 

Which doesn't mean that people don't matter to me, because they do. It just means that it's very helpful for me if people announce their feelings. I'll happily take them into account! It's just a lot of work for me to figure out what they are. There are a lot of emotional/social rules that I don't know, but I know they're there and sometimes it feels like EVERYONE knows what they are except me. So I tend to go quiet rather than transgress.

And when I do have strong feelings, I rarely have the words to be able to explain them to someone. No emotional language, after all.

But all this means that I will only know that someone likes me if they explicitly say so. The thing where two people talk and realize they like each other? Never happens to me. Arguably *can't* happen to me. But I like talking to people -- I'm particularly good at bantering. I banter so well, I could be in a Joss Whedon story and everyone will think ""Yeah, that guy really fits in here"".***

This isn't a pity party: I've got a good life. I somehow acquired a wife, and she came with a social group and community and I'm happy to be part of both. 

But I still want to know: how do people make friends?***** How do they make friendships grow?

March 2015,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/03/05/wonder/,"March 2015, 05",Wonder,"A Simple Idea:

What if we spent as much time reading and studying scientific texts as we did religious ones?  What if there were more Principia study groups than Bible groups? What if more people knew the story of Archimedes and its meaning than the story of Noah’s Ark? What if we memorized natural laws, and as many people knew what E=MC² meant as John 3:16?

A Framework:

Let’s retool the machinery for indoctrinating our kids.  Let’s change the payload of mythic stories and fear and replace it with knowledge and wonder. You can set aside an hour a week to discuss great ideas and explanations of the world. Sit down with your family, your friends, and study and discuss a single topic, or a single aspect of a topic. It doesn’t have to replace Sunday school. It can be alongside it. Let’s learn from religious techniques to bring wonder to the masses.

Let’s find a way to present it in bites that are easy to swallow. Let’s make it social. Let’s make it relevant to everyday modern life. Let’s learn in small groups in people’s homes. Let’s put wow into the pursuit of answers. Let’s wonder.

A Spark:

It’s hard to deny the grandeur of the universe when you look at the night sky or see a bee’s wing under the microscope. We all react to that. Call it God, call it Nature, call it the Universe, we all feel it. Let’s use that as a jumping-off point and carry that ember with us, nurturing it, poking at its edges, learning. Let’s stoke it and warm to its flame every week with our friends.

A Method:

Build on that wonder by asking, “Why?”  Make a guess, test it, use the results to make another guess. Teach this method and give everyone the tools to find answers. To build on what others have done. To stand on the shoulders of giants. Make inquiry a lens through which we see the world.

Motivation:

Failure to believe in science will not send you to hell. What can motivate people to the Truth without the threat of eternal damnation? What can motivate them like the promise of eternal life does? Probably nothing. But the more we know about our world, the better we can understand our place in it.

A Few More Questions:

Can the teachings be tied to spirituality? Can studying science provide comfort for the nagging question of why we are here and what happens when we die? If the truth is that there is nothing, can that be mitigated or even transcended by our knowledge of greater truth and our place in it? Or is it just a hollow pursuit and a dramatic bummer? I don’t have answers, but let’s get together and ask them! It’s ok to be smart and not sheep. Let’s search. Let’s wonder.

Core:

We need to develop curricula with workbooks and study questions and areas for further study in disciplines like Physics, Chemistry, Evolution, Thermodynamics, Quantum Mechanics, Gravity, Cells, Germ theory, DNA.

We need accessible and consistent translations of the Gospels of the Saints of Science. For example:

 Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica

 Relativity: The Special and the General Theory

 On the Origin of  Species

We will probably need Saints:

Copernicus, Darwin, Da Vinci, Archimedes, Newton, Aristotle, Hawking, Asimov, Sagan, Feynman, Galileo, Vesalius, Dawkins. Schrodinger, Wilson, Hooke, Freud, Einstein, Archimedes, Pasteur, Curie, Crick

It just an idea and not a treatise nailed to a door. But it could work. It could be a new way to do things. Could it catch on?

I wonder.

We became best friends over hot chocolate and vowed to find each other someday. I’ve always wondered if he’s forgotten, or if he’s still searching as well.

Rather than bombard you with long paragraphs, I thought I would give you short, quick statements, stories and thoughts with an action item at the end, in hopes that you only spend a few minutes reading and that you enjoy yourself.

- The sound of a ticking clock reminds me of my Baba’s house. I wear his Mickey Mouse watch every day. It doesn’t work, which I love, and it reminds me to stay young and to not take life too seriously.

- Stepping onto a soccer field is a euphoric feeling that I will never grow old of.

 - I’m 21 years old, from San Diego, CA, and I graduate this May from the George Washington University in DC.

- Don’t ever underestimate the power of a thorough and thoughtful “thank you”. I spent 365 days doing so to someone different each day, in person or over the phone, and ended up giving a TED talk about it (google my name and “TEDx” if you’re interested). It’s the most incredible feeling the world, and it’s the best way I know to make others feel truly alive and happy.

- I will always stop at lemonade stands.

- Last year I witnessed my Dad hit a hole-in-one. That was really special J

- While traveling recently, a man asked me what my favorite non-musical sound was. My answer was contagious laughter. What’s yours?

- I hope to one day be fully confident in my physical appearance. Words from the past can linger.

- Coming out was hard, but watching people struggle from the other side is harder. Reach out and listen if you can.

- Forever grateful to the teachers and mentors I’ve had. You are the unsung heroes of society.

- Things I love: chocolate milk, the window seat, when the lights go out at a concert, The Giving Tree, the smell of the ocean, adventure, getting the shivers, the word “squeegee,” cityscapes, learning from failure, being weird, sneezing, a challenge, specific beats of songs, videos of Ellen surprising people, stepping on crunchy leaves.

- Asking for help is difficult, but I’m glad I learned: I’m the organizer of TEDxFoggyBottom here in DC, and never in a million years would I be the person I am today, or would our event be what it is today without my team’s relentless passion and enthusiasm. I’m honored to work with you all J

- Love to my family, Kasey for introducing me to the Listserve, and to Julia and the rest of her family. #TeamDoug

For the last three weeks his parents, residents of a slum over an hour away, had sat vigil at the hospital. That is to say, his mother didn’t leave her boy’s side, while his father slept on a bench outside at night – only one person was permitted in the hospital room at a time. Their son had leukemia - a form of it that comes with a good prognosis here in the United States. But without access to proper care or lifesaving bone marrow transplants, my friend’s son was swallowed up by the gap that persists between rich and poor. I watched as the doctors hurriedly explained that their son had died from caca en el sangre (“poop in his blood”).  The nuns sent them away with a small, ceramic angel to take his place.

I spent the next few weeks in a haze of self-indulgent bitterness; homesick and self-loathing and fed-up with the state of the world. I didn’t believe in angels, let alone ceramic ones. What else was there to do but sulk?

But as I stewed, my friends began to make the end of their son’s story the beginning of a new one. They volunteered to become Community Health Workers with the organization that had attempted to treat their son. They studied how to take blood pressure and read A1C levels. They spent Saturdays taking neighbors to doctors’ appointments on their motorcycle, foregoing the chance to make some much-needed cash on charging for trips. They spent hours sorting medications for field clinics and began leading community health groups. They did it all between crying jags and long silent spells. They did it in spite of a grief I cannot even fathom.

In two weeks, my friends are expecting the completely unexpected – the birth of a baby boy whom I’ll be lucky enough to call my godson. They are overjoyed and so am I. I don’t know what will happen in my godson’s story or how long it will last. But I write this in hopes of one day sharing with him how his story began; with two parents who quietly and unassumingly possess the strength to overcome their own struggles to do good in this world. And with a godmother who is so incredibly grateful to have learned from them. And with all of us ready to welcome him.

In a world that so often fails the individuals who are brought into it, I want him to know that he is loved, that he is important, and that no matter what, he has someone rooting for him. And when he struggles, I want him to know that like his parents, he can be so much stronger, smarter, kinder, and more courageous than he ever imagined.

Please consider checking out Health Horizons International in the Dominican Republic (hhidr dot org).  My friend now works for them full-time and continues to do an amazing job of helping the organization grow. Your support can help make the community that my godson will grow up in a safer, healthier, more equitable place.

Finally, in two weeks, I turn 29 (yikes!). Please e-mail me with suggestions of places to go, experiences to have, or things to do before I am 30. And if you’re ever in Denver, Colorado and want to grab a beer – shoot me an e-mail!

February 2015,28,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/02/28/the-epic-aesthetic-experience/,"February 2015, 28",The Epic Aesthetic Experience,"Hello Everyone,

To briefly introduce myself, my name is William and I live in Toronto.

Alluding to the title of this ""Listserve"" post, I argue that the ‘epic aesthetic experience’ encompasses a multitude of personal events, from which I associate these memories with art gallery visits. I can only disclose that the art gallery continues to be a major source of therapy – quite literally. Before the aesthetic magic, I lived in Peterborough, Ontario (Canada).

In July 2012, I found myself at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York. Through happenstance, I discovered this quaint self-portrait. I said to myself, “I will be seeing a lot of you this year.” Located on the main floor of the gallery, relatively adjacent to a Chagall painting, I could only feel the “seeing a lot of you” vibe in the near future.

Over the course of 2012 and 2013, I experienced an incredible exhibition synchronicity at the Art Gallery of Ontario, here in Toronto, and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia. I will let you, the reader, figure out to which exhibition I refer. My personal distinctions, at the time of exhibition, were that I reveled (“lived”) at the AGO, and close family lived in Atlanta.

This painting of Albright-Knox origin travelled to Toronto and Atlanta for this travelling exhibition. I will never forget my amazed surprise to see the SAME painting on its own wall at the AGO, after having seen it at the Albright-Knox. At the High, this portrait complemented a series of the artist’s self-portraits as part of her oeuvre.

A year later, after having enjoyed a pleasurable summer in Atlanta, I found myself back at Albright-Knox in September 2014. I not only made the official move to Toronto, but the painting also coincidentally returned. Nevertheless, I said to myself, “WHOA.”

The dots are all connected. Thank you for reading.

Wishing all of you well,

WilliamToronto (Canada)

She closed the book, placed it on the table, and, finally, prepared herself to walk through the door. She rose slowly from the divan and, as she moved across the small room that had been her sanctuary in the City of Peace for one thousand nights, she took one more moment for farewell. The sumptuous carpets, exquisite wall hangings, and heavy perfume here obliterated her memory of the spare rooms that long ago she had shared with her sister and their father, the king’s vizier.

When she reached the door, she looked back to the book one final time, though she knew all too well it had nothing more to offer. The gilt on its cover reflected the candlelight, winking as if to offer her encouragement. She breathed in slowly to settle her mind, then turned and began her journey down the shadowed hallway to the chambers of the King.

The book had provided her with one thousand stories, one thousand stays of execution, one thousand chances to see the dawn break. She had never discovered how the book had come to be hidden among the pillows, waiting for her to feel it, hard beneath her as she sobbed on the divan that first lonely day in the palace. The stories in that book had saved her life, and their characters had become her only friends.

She had spent the thousandth day combing through the book in case a story had escaped her notice, but the story of the night before had been the final one. Tonight, if there was to be a story that would extend her life for another day, it would have to come from within her.

On other nights, she had wished for the escort that had accompanied her in the early weeks of her imprisonment. But tonight she was thankful for the chance to be alone with her thoughts, tortured as they were. After the thousand wondrous tales in the book, what story could one with a life as inconsequential as hers possibly hope to tell?

Equidistant between her room and the King's chambers, the lone window in the hallway let in a beam of silver moonlight that made irrelevant the feeble golden candlelight from the wall sconces. For the first time in a thousand nights, she was not desperately repeating the book's story in her head as she moved toward her fate. With nothing memorized and everything to lose, she gazed up at the moon, and as she did so a story began to take shape. She dared to stand there for several moments, taking strength and, yes, affirmation from the moon as she felt, rather than thought out, the plot. For the first time, there was no need for hours of memorization; this story was seared onto her heart.

As she crossed the threshold of the king's chambers and bowed low before him, servants scurried to adjust candles and refresh food and drink. Like other nights, the two children she had borne the king were at his side, unaware that any night of storytelling might end with their father’s order for the execution of their mother.  But she knew that this would not happen tonight. She stepped into the middle of the room, smiled at her king and their children and, finally, began to tell her final story.

""Once upon a time, in the City of Peace, a great king commanded his vizier to bring him a virgin each night until there was but one the land.""

February 2015,25,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/02/25/doubt-and-space/,"February 2015, 25",Doubt and Space,"When I was a kid (I tend to imagine I was 12, but I might have been 10 or 13) my dream was to become a philosopher. I had read some of Jostein Gaarder children’s books and an intro book on Kant. I was taken by it, my mind came to it easily and hungrily, and it felt important.

I don’t know when or how I came to feel that this would not be a feasible or acceptable future to aim for. There is no one moment I can point to that set me off course, but when I went to university, I didn’t study philosophy. I didn’t even consider it. I studied other things, for reasons that I thought were right, reasons like usefulness, security, some vague notion of respectability. I studied things which had fixed paths into the future, clear directions for what I would do and who I would become. I say things, plural, because I couldn’t settle down. Whereever I was, I wanted out, I changed paths several times. None of the choices lasted very long before they got eaten up at the edges by doubt and listlessness.

I’ve never been very good at being sure. I question the most basic things, up to and including life itself. It’s a habit I’ve never found a good use for, it has mostly served to make my life difficult. Perpetual doubt is not a comfortable state of mind, but I don’t think that there is any certainty out there in which I can find an easy rest.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I was also one of those kids who were seriously fascinated with space. You know, the kind of kid who talks with endless enthusiasm about galaxies and black holes, the idea that the stars you see are so far away that by the time their light reach you they might be long dead, etc. The vastness, the overwhelming numbers, a scope that made me dizzy, thinking of it gave me a joyful vertigo.

Even now, I often revisit the following series of thoughts: We are made by the same stuff as the rest of the universe. We are about 7 billion consciousnesses walking about on a relatively tiny globe, talking and thinking and observing ourselves and the universe, while at the same time being a part of it. In every one of us, part of the universe is conscious, is aware: We are the universe observing itself. I find both comfort and awe in this shift in perspective.

I am now finally and slowly making my way back to some incarnation of the dream I had when I was a kid. It doesn’t offer a clear path forward, and I am not sure if I am any more certain of my choice now than I have ever been. But I think it’s time I gave that 12-year old a chance. Wish me luck.

Thank you for all the stories. I would love to hear from you, to hear how you deal with uncertainty, and what you think is true and important, then and now. Feel free to mail me or talk to me on twitter, I'm @mareinna. I wish you all the best.

Thats a .00004% chance of being picked! I'd better make it good I guess...

What I wanted to talk about was my current perspective of time. I feel like I'm at a moment in my life where time seems to be speeding up at the rate of Moore's Law. After spending 3.5 years at The University of Texas at Austin, I am about to spend my last semester of college at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. I've been waiting my whole life to travel to Australia, so I am feeling a hodgepodge of emotions right now. It could be described as a mixture of excitement, impatience, nervousness, sadness, and a tiny desire to stay at home where I know I will be comfortable. Whatever I'm feeling, I'm ready.

Within the month of returning from Australia, I will be moving to San Francisco (from Dallas, Texas) with my girlfriend and starting my first job. I think this fact is what makes it seem like time is moving in light speed. Moving in with the GF, living in a new, bustling city, starting a big boy job, taking care of my own finances. It's a lot to take in when it seems like just yesterday I met my wonderful girlfriend of 4+ years (we are high school sweethearts). 

It certainly feels like a whirlwind of time right now, but I can't wait to see my personal growth (knock on wood) at the end of it.

Anyways, thank you for taking the time to read my little spiel (I never actually knew spiel was spelled like that till this moment). If you are a traveler, someone from Sydney, someone from San Francisco, or anyone that wants to get in touch please do email me. After a stint of using AirBnB's while traveling, I have found that I love talking to and meeting strangers!

Last note, housing in San Fran is pretty daunting.. Any tips and advice on finding a place is more than welcomed and appreciated :)

February 2015,23,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/02/23/falling-off-a-cliff/,"February 2015, 23",Falling Off a Cliff,"When I was in school, I was very busy with sports and entrepreneurial ventures.  Although I did very well academically, I never had time for, or interest in, reading for pleasure.  I read the absolute minimum necessary for school work and always for the purpose of getting a good grade.  Certainly not for pleasure.  Because I never developed the habit of reading in my youth, I never read as an adult either (it probably didn't help that my wife is not a reader).

I am 48 years old now and a few years ago, I started to realize that I was really missing out on a lot by not reading for enjoyment (as opposed to reading for work).  I started to ask friends for book recommendations and began reading for just 15 minutes or so each night before going to sleep.  And more on the weekends.  I am a slow, plodding reader and I fall asleep often if I read too much, but I am really enjoying it.  Without sounding trite, It's like a whole new world for me!  I have read fiction, biographies, sci-fi, short stories and more.  I have been experimenting with a bit of everything.

More recently, I came to the conclusion that I had really missed out by not reading the classics while I was in high school and college.  Well, I did read some of them because I had to, but I never read them for enjoyment and I certainly never read them from cover to cover.  If Cliffs Notes were available, I read those instead.  I'm talking about books like Tom Sawyer, Moby Dick, the great Shakespeare plays, Robinson Crusoe, Gulliver's Travels, Pride & Prejudice, Call of the Wild, Red Badge of Courage, etc.

I mentioned this to my wife and for my last birthday, she surprised me with something called the Library of Classics.  It's an MP3 player with all of the classic books loaded on it as audiobooks.  I have never listened to audiobooks before and I didn't know if I would like them.  But I have to tell you, it's even better than reading!  The narrators make it so interesting (it's like they're acting it out) and the time just flies.  I listen when I go to the gym (which actually makes that more pleasant) and when I drive to the office.  And just recently started listening at home on the couch during the weekends.  This MP3 player has an amazing selection of audio books and I am loving it!  Bonus: I'm also spending less time watching inane TV shows. 

So why am I sharing this with you?  Why am I using my opportunity as the Listserv winner  to tell you about this?  Because I want to urge you to read, especially the classics.  And if you haven't already, try audiobooks.  It has really exposed me to so much that I had been missing out on.  I have learned a lot, been entertained and I honestly think it has made me a more well-rounded person.  It's also been a good influence on my kids (I'm still working on my wife, though).

Start with just a few minutes a day.  Or try the Library of Classics or other audiobooks if you think you would enjoy that more.  But give it a try.  You won't be sorry.

If that name sounds familiar, there are a few possible reasons. Perhaps we're friends; I've even had past friends win The Listserve (Hi, Mark!).

More likely, if you DO recognize by name, it's because it's on the radio all the time. I'm sorry about that.

See, I sell podcast ads for a living, and one of the advertisers I sold podcast ads to wanted to branch into radio ads. And they said, ""Gee, Lex, you have a nice voice—would you be willing to do our voiceovers for the radio?"" I figured it would be a one-off thing, and, you know, anything for an advertiser!

Since then, I've recorded hundreds of spots. And each of them starts out, ""Hi, I'm Lex Friedman.""

So when people hear my name, they recognize it, but often don't remember why.

That's fun. Of course, it's more fun to be known and/or remembered for things I'm prouder of than ""reading someone else's script into a microphone."" I think I'm good at a few things.

I've written a couple humor books: The Snuggie Sutra (which is exactly what it sounds like) and The Kid in the Crib, which is a Dr. Seuss parody. I host a few podcasts. I invented the modern dishwasher. I once wrote a paragraph in the middle of an email with only one lie in it.

We have a new puppy. He's a poodle/schnauzer mix. A schnoodle, if you will. (I will.) His name is Cody. I mention this mostly because my previous paragraph referred to being in the middle of an email, and so I need to add a few more paragraphs to make it true. I can't let my email to thousands upon thousands of strangers contain falsehoods!

I'm a fan of improvisational theater. I took classes for years at the Groundlings school in Los Angeles, eventually — after years — qualifying for the highest-level class, for which there was a waiting list. I sat on the waiting list for a year, and then another. Eventually, my wife and I moved across the country. The next day, a spot opened up for the class. I never got to take it.

I mention all this because my approach to this email has been improvisational. I imagine it shows. But I haven't planned this email; I'm really just plowing ahead. I made up this very sentence as I went along. And this one! The entire paragraph, really. Gazebo! Elephants in an elevator! Schnoodle!

Anyway, I've occasionally given thought to what I would write should I ever win the Listserve. This is not what I expected. I'm okay with that. I hope you are too.

Yours, but mostly mine,

February 2015,20,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/02/20/a-tomato-for-your-thoughts/,"February 2015, 20",A Tomato for Your Thoughts...,"When I was 12 years old and entering middle school there was a distinct shift from the carefree innocence of elementary school. The girls started wearing makeup and straightening their hair. It was then that I realized there was one definition of beauty and I was not it. My lips were too thin. My nose was too round. My skin had been taken over my pimples. My boobs were nonexistent. I was awkward. Not helping my “situation” was that I had the most gorgeous mother. She was the definition of beauty that I strived to be. And there was my sister who was only14 months older, yet had developed much earlier and seemed to have skipped the awkward phase.

This insecurity that began while I was in middle school continued throughout high school and by the time I reached college this insecurity had grown to affect my interactions with people, my focus in school, and my ability to be comfortable being myself...I had put my mom on a pedestal and constantly compared myself to my sister and the models and actresses airbrushed on magazines. This physical insecurity had completely enveloped me and had grown to affect my own self worth- I was internally telling myself that I was ugly, unattractive, not smart enough, not cool enough, not funny enough, not worthy of friends.

It wasn’t until I was 20-21 years old that things started to shift internally. I started “to come into my own” as they say. I met truly wonderful, confident and beautiful friends in college who opened me up to acknowledging my own self worth. I realized I was more than my external self. My inner dialogue which I’ve become even more in touch with recently through my meditation practice changed from negative self talk to positive reinforcement, appreciation and love for myself.

I think everyone has dealt with some sort of insecurity at some point. What I’ve learned is how important confidence is, our internal dialogue, and acceptance. We are all our own worst critic. And that’s by choice. We have the power to change how we think and govern our own thoughts. We have the power to be confident, to love ourselves and to be happy. Someone once told me that we can choose our thoughts like we choose our tomatoes. When we go to the grocery store and we’re selecting which tomatoes we’re going to purchase, we sort through the bin and avoid the discolored or bruised ones. We seek to find that perfectly shaped, bright colored tomato. The same goes for our thoughts, except we’re less selective…We don’t spend as much time choosing our thoughts. We let the negative thoughts seep right in.

There will always be external factors affecting what you may be dealing with internally. But, only YOU can choose how to interpret and react to them. It’s still a learning process for me but let me ask you-how do you channel your inner voice? How have you found your confidence and acceptance of yourself? Please feel free to send me an email at  to share your thoughts.

Lastly,

Be Kind to Yourself.

Maybe it was my anti-microbes OCD or also the embarrassment of knowing that if I was locked for too long in the bathroom people would know what I was doing (as if others didn’t shit as well). I don’t know how my calculations failed, but during an afternoon English class I got the urge. It was very bad and I couldn’t wait anymore. I asked the teacher for permission to go to the restroom, determined to finally be able to “Go” outside home (only because it was very urgent), and left the classroom in search of a room I had never used before. I remember asking a secretary were it was and she pointed out the direction. Maybe it was because I was nervous or it was just fate, but I couldn’t find the damned place. All the running must have adjusted the contents of my intestines and the urge subsided, which led me to think that instead of going back to the classroom I should head to my grandma’s house in order to take care of business. Grandma’s place was closer to the school than my house, just a short bus ride away. I could’ve walked, but fearing the urge would come back while walking I decided my best option was to get on that bus. Bus arrives. I get in. Sit down. Necessity strikes and, ooops, I couldn’t hold it. I kept looking out the window. I – myself - could not believe what had just happened so I went into what can be described as an out of body experience. I was there, crapped pants and all, but it’s like I wasn’t there. The damaged was not noticed by other passengers for a while, but when one shouted “Driver, it smells like shit in here” it was inevitable. The driver ignored it at first, but then EVERYONE on the bus started complaining and saying “it frigging smells like someone took a dump on the bus”. Driver stops the bus, comes back to where we all are, and like a hound dog starts sniffing for the origin of such fetid smell. He approaches me and politely asks me “Boy, did you shit your pants?” I confirmed. It must’ve been my utter terror and shame showing in my face. He asked me where I was going, decided it was close enough and allowed me to stay on. Everyone complained and I didn’t know where to bury my head. Stop. I descend. Sit is soiled. The back of my pants are soiled and soggy. I start walking to my grandma’s and on the way, at three different occasions, two men and one boy yelled at me “Hey, boy! Did you crap your pants?” Fast forward some 25 years and this story has somehow become a staple conversation at any family reunion. I laugh about it, but it took some years to get over my fears of having a similar episode happen. I can now proudly go No. 2 anywhere. I’ve sat on toilets in +200 cities in 40 countries around the world.

How to create anything in your life:

1.       Visualize. Concentrate on the end result and the feelings you’ll have once you achieve it.

2.       Release.

3.       Enjoy the unfolding.

I’ve been practicing this for 15 years now with some amazing results.

Travel. Anywhere you can. Getting out there opens your mind, and makes you a better person. You’ll compare at first, but then you’ll realize the beauty that lies in our differences.

We tend to have blinders on when these topics come up, a “that only happens in big cities, not in my town” sort of mentality.  The truth is much scarier.  You cannot drive very far in any city or town without seeing these problems with your own eyes.  My challenge to you is two-fold; first you must actually “see” the problem.  Acknowledge that it is real and exists where you live.  Second, DO SOMETHING!  You might think that you’re only one person and you can’t make a difference.  You are WRONG!  Everyone can make a difference, regardless of age or economic status.  If you can’t give food or money or clothing, you can still make a difference simply by acknowledging the people that are enduring hunger, poverty or homelessness.  Treating these folks as human beings can have a huge impact on them.  I have been volunteering with the middle school youth at my church for eight or nine years and one of our projects is to collect items and then go to a local park in our city where our homeless friends congregate and distribute those items.  Along the way we engage with them on a personal level through conversations; sometimes they just need someone to listen to them.  I have witnessed the most amazing connections happen in these settings!  Sometimes the teachable moments just happen:  on one trip as we were distributing items someone asked me where I worked.  I turned to see one of our homeless friends smiling and asking me again.  I told her the names of places I had worked.  Turns out she had been a coworker of mine some 18 years ago!  Imagine our shock at reconnecting in such a way!  You can tell people that homelessness can happen to anyone, but when you see it firsthand like that it really drives the point home.

I have no illusions that one email can change the course of hunger, poverty and homelessness in the world; but if we can make it a little better for just one person then I would count that as a victory!

Never take tomorrow for granted; we are guaranteed nothing in this world!

My parents immigrated to Canada during the Vietnam War and were placed in Creston, BC. Here, I was born into a small town of less than 5,000 people. We moved to Cranbrook then to Vancouver where I have spent most of my life. 

Growing up I was a pretty shy kid. I was terrified of speaking in front of people, or being in situations where I was the focus of attention (eg. presentations). It has taken some time, but I am happy to report that I have gotten over it. I comfortable talking to strangers, leading groups, and presenting on topics that I am passionate about. 

I have been fortunate to work in the hospitality and tourism industry where I get a chance to meet and talk to so many different people from around the world. Having the 2010 Olympics hosted in Vancouver helped tremendously. For some reason, I have not traveled outside of North America before. My first trip overseas was at the end of 2014 where I went to Hong Kong and spent several weeks being immersed into the local culture and atmosphere. This trip opened my eyes and my desire to explore the world. 

I love exploring the different neighbourhoods of cities and towns, that I end up going back several times. It is probably why I have not ventured out off this continent much (so much to see and eat!).  2015's goal is to see and experience more, which has me booked to go to Italy (Florence) at the end of May. Hoping to see some parts of France, Germany, and the UK as well. 

I guess the point of this is to do something that takes you out of your comfort zone. Put down that smartphone and say hello to someone you're standing in line with! Travel somewhere new and try something different, especially the local cuisine. No need to look for that chain restaurant from back home. 

You'll never know who you'll meet and the stories they will share!

At first I didn’t know what to do when I won, because I’ve only been subscribed to the listserve for about three weeks. But I didn’t want to pass over the opportunity.

I’m 19 years old and I’m astrophysics student. I love science, and I think science (education) should play a bigger role in our lives. We’ve got such a beautiful universe, and live on a beautiful earth. But all most of us know about it is the things we learn in primary, middle or high school. We’ve soon forgotten what we’ve learned when we graduate, because it was taught to us by some dusty teacher without any passion.

But there’s more than that! Have you ever seen a picture of the beautiful horsehead nebula? Or felt a rose crumble in your hands after it was frozen with liquid nitrogen? Felt the g-force in a rollercoaster? Cool, right?! Not convinced? I’m inviting you to join me and discover the fun and beauty of science!

I’m planning to make a video showing people around the world having fun, learning or being overwhelmed all because of science. And I need your help. If you want to join me, please send me a video of you, your family, your friends, your class, someone you just happened to walk into on the street, it can be anyone, as long as you’re “sciencing”!

Some examples of what you could do:

-Build a water rocket. There are a lot of tutorials on the internet on how to do this, and I promise you it will fly really high!

-Go to the local observatory if there is one in your area. If it’s open at night you can ask if you could take a look through the telescope and look at a cool planet or galaxy!

-Take a trip to a museum of natural history, where you can see awesome dinosaur skeletons!

-Try to spot animals in the wild and study them for a while, try to make sure they don’t spot you!

-Try to find out how fast objects of different mass are falling. Hint: they will all have the same acceleration! Don’t believe me? Try it yourself!

Of course, you can come up with your own ideas. If you’re not sure whether your idea is good enough (I’m sure it is, I trust you guys), you can always send me an e-mail.

If you’re going to send me a video, please:

-Do it by e-mail, my address is below

-In the subject line, put “SCIENCE VIDEO”

-In the e-mail, tell me where you’re from!

-You don’t have to supply your name, but I’d like it if you do, and of course I’ll credit you

-Don’t film vertically, I’m afraid I can only use horizontally orientated video’s

If you have any questions, please e-mail me as well. You can also send me an e-mail if you don’t want to make a video, or if it depends on the deadline, but want to stay informed about the project (put “INFORMED” in the subject line), I’ll set up a mailing list and eventually send all of you a link to the finished video.

The deadline until when I’ll accept videos isn’t known yet, it will depend on the amount of reactions I receive. It will be published through the mailing list. But if you send it to me earlier than May, It’ll surely be accepted.

I have a big interest for electronic music culture, as I am a marketing intern at one of Amsterdam’s biggest nightclubs.

In the creative industries - from which the scene I work in is a part of - I hear people tell me and others that they are 'too busy' to meet, go out for lunch, have a drink, work on another project or even answer a simple question awfully often.

Back in the days, I was one of them to blame for the same habit. When people were politely asking me how I was doing, the first answer that came to mind was 'I am very busy', 'I am really tired of all the work I had to do' and some more of those mood-killing statements.

Well, here are some of my thoughts on this subject:

Ø  If you really are convinced that you have too little time to live your loco busy life, just come out of bed an hour earlier. Or go to bed an hour later. Anyways, stop crying about it. There is always time.

Ø  You are never too busy, you just choose to be busy. It really isn’t about the time you have, it’s about prioritizing. You have got just as many hours in one day as Einstein, Steve Jobs or Nelson Mandela had to achieve what you want to achieve. Get it?

Ø  Saying you are ‘too busy’ or ‘stressed-out’ is not really a great conversation-starter. Really, everybody is stressed out these days. It really is a negative way to start a conversation, the only thing you are saying with something like that is that you are super important and very necessary. We all think that of ourselves, you don’t have to put it out there again.

So please, let’s start a little movement here together. How stuffed your agenda may be, how many projects you are on at the same moment and how many sport clubs you have to attend during one week, don’t say you are ‘too busy’. Just come up with something more interesting.

If someone asks you if you have got time to meet, don’t respond with ‘I am too busy’, but respond with ‘that’s not my first priority’. Let’s see how that feels.

When I stopped yelling around that I was too busy, it really helped me feeling less stressed out and besides that it automatically helped me prioritize. Just give it a try!

I would love to hear your thoughts on this subject. Is there also a ‘too busy’-culture in your country or the scene where you work in? And how do you feel about this?

All the best,

He is from Peru and he is hitting on you but not so much that you mind. He gives you his business card, but you will never call. This is your first and last conversation, and even though it means something you will never remember the details or his name. It is cloudy but the sun will come out later.He gives you a keychain. It's gold colored metal and it's a tiny replica of an Incan sacrificial knife. It has the word ""PERU"" stamped on one side. You give him your soapstone necklace.You never see him again.You step off onto the island.You step off onto the island and into the fort. You pass under the chalk-white stalactites forming from the old concrete, calcium leeching from the building in the rain over centuries.Someday this will all be dust.You walk over the dry moat and through the reinforced wooden doors, past the tightly turning granite staircase that goes nowhere now but used to lead to the overpass for dropping shit on the invaders that never came. The yard is in front of you. The sun has come out.The yard is green and bright and someone is flying a kite but no one picnics here because it's forbidden. The horse chestnut trees are to your right, with the warning sign that says ""DO NOT EAT THE CHESTNUTS."" You walk across the lawn.Cannons line the walls above you. Stagnant pools occupy the spaces once held by the enormous weapons that faced out into the open water. The weapons that searched for U-boats. New concrete on old concrete on granite blocks.This place is haunted.No women died on this island, at least none that we know of. Two men, deserters, were shot in the 1860s, but no women.There was no desperate wife who stole the uniform of her enemies and made her way to the kindest and gentlest of all the Civil War prisons, she was not caught and was not hanged in an oversized black robe. The stories exist to scare children.But she was seen.You walk across the lawn, past the bakery where you sat on a windowsill and sang to the nothing in the dry moat below. Past the narrow way you explored blindly as a child, at once relieved and disappointed when it deposited you right back where you began. Past the old shells sitting on the lawn, never to be fired.You walk under the arch, and into the dark hallway.You put your left hand on the wall, cool with condensation even in the summer months. You can see the end of the hallway faintly, but it is not your destination.You walk along the uneven flagstones. No flashlights, no cell phones.You left hand reaches the corner you cannot see, and you turn.There is a metal gate at the end of this narrow passage that is locked up when school tours are on the island. No one wants to lose a kid in the dark room. It is not locked today.The room is dark. A single shaft of light falls from the ceiling, a few bricks removed for a chimney. You cannot see the walls.There is only a small shaft of light, too faint to see by.You keep your hand to the wall and walk yourself along the far side until you reach the back of the room. The sides are curved, and you worry about hitting your head.You stand in the corner, facing the light.You stand alone in the dark.It doesn't take long for the nameless fear to sink in. SOMETHING is here. SOMETHING is dangerous. You cannot see anything but the shaft of light.You are not alone.You stand in the corner and you breathe, because you are not dead yet and as long as you can breathe you will be okay.You breathe and you tell yourself ""I am the scariest thing in this room.""You tell yourself ""I am the scariest thing in this room.""And suddenly it's true.You see by the light of the chimney, the brick walls and the worn flagstones. The open gate and the odd remnants of paint.You stand and you wait for your meal to arrive.Someday you will leave this place. Someday you will get back on the ferry and everyone will come home and everything will go back to normal. Someday this will just be a thing that you did, a story for parties. Someday people will laugh with you and think ""how delightfully eccentric"" and pretend that they would do the same if they only had the time.But they won't.They do not walk into dark rooms. They do not look into the mirror when there is nothing to see.You are the scariest thing in this room.

Taking my productivity seriously has changed my life like crazy, to the extent that I'm now trying to launch a small productivity product. Amazingly, I won the Listserve the same week that I'm announcing this, my first product, and that's why I've chosen to write about this rather than any of the other myriad things I could just as easily decide to write about.

I know there are plenty of other productivity freaks out there, so here, for their benefit, is a short list things that you simply must check out if you're into productivity:

Currently I am working on a new series called 'Beyond Infinity'. In this series I draw from my evolving curiosity about the paradoxes of the self in context. Growth and decay. Seduction and danger. Withdrawal and pursuit. Indulgence and restraint. Chaos and order. Strength and vulnerability. Permanence and impermanence. The structural elements in the sculptures both resist and rely on one another for the pieces to exist. 

Being a glassblower never really crossed my mind until one day a friend mentioned that they were going to take a class so I tagged along. Walking into the studio I saw someone taking glass out of the furnace and I was instantly hypnotized by the glowing orange mass of molten glass. I had never seen anything like it and all I wanted to do was find out more about it. Shortly after I signed up and took my first class at a private studio in Cleveland Ohio.

After only a few weeks I knew it was what I wanted to do with my life and I never looked back. 

Since that first class in Cleveland I have gotten to travel the world doing glass. From blowing glass on a cruise ship in Europe and the Caribbean to most recently spending a year in Taiwan building a studio and teaching glassblowing to art students at a university. Presently glass has brought me to south Florida where I am working on my new series of sculptures and helping launch a new art center near Palm Beach. If you are in the area I invite you to come check out the glass studio and if not I encourage you to visit your local glassblowing studio. I guarantee you wont regret it.

February 2015,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/02/05/the-frog-master/,"February 2015, 05",The Frog Master,"I was a pretty good kid. Other than occasional acts of extreme rudeness (hanging up the phone on my father before he was done talking – this is the only time I can remember being shouted at by him) or impulsive, ill-informed choices that scared the crap out of my parents (coming very close to jumping off of the top of our swingset with a plastic bag as my ‘parachute’), I didn’t give my parents or teachers any real cause for alarm or discipline. I was a quiet, dreamy-eyed kid who fidgeted a lot and tried to be kind to everybody.

As I was born with severe allergies to fur, dust, pollen, and the like, we were never allowed to get the dog I so longed for. Forming close relationships with stuffed animals was also out of the question. While I was permitted to drag Brown Bear around during the day (my parents weren’t totally heartless), I have distinct memories of my little guy being gently tugged from my grasp as I pretended to sleep, then watching through half-closed eyes as my mother or father placed him a safe distance away on my dresser.

I was going to have to find another way to fill this hole in my heart.

Fast forward to second grade. It is just after 8 AM, and I am in the middle of a three-seater on the back of the school bus hugging a small plastic terrarium to my chest. Inside of it are small rocks, a few pieces of moss, a dish with water in it, and a frog-- The frog is strikingly colorful—navy blue with bright orange and red markings on its back—and its big, black eyes bulge with fear. It is completely and perfectly still, but none of the kids around me seem to mind this fact.

“Is it poisonous?” they ask.“I’m not sure,” I answer.“Is he scared?”“Yeah, really scared… He trusts me though.”

To the delight of my classmates, my second grade-teacher is totally in favor of putting the frog terrarium on display for everyone to enjoy. She clears a space for it on top of the tables in the back of the room, and for the rest of the day the class is abuzz with talk of the exciting new visitor. Everyone is eager to stop by the little tank and check on how the frog is adjusting to his new environment, and there are so many trips to the water fountain and bathroom that eventually my teacher has to revoke the privilege.

I, too, visit the frog terrarium several times that day: once during lunch, when I’ve come inside to use the bathroom and once during group activity period, when everyone is moving about the room and too busy to notice me move the frog. Each time, someone inevitably notices it and sends a current of excitement through the room.

“He moved! He moved! He’s closer to his water!”“He must be getting thirsty!”Each time, I am equally thrilled and relieved.

By the middle of the afternoon, the class’ fascination with the minute movements of my frog has only grown, and finally my teacher makes an exciting proposition. Why don’t we move Mr. Frog to a bigger home, she says. We’ve got an empty old fish tank in the science classroom, so why don’t we just clean it out and give him more space to roam?

Cleaning out the fish tank is the last activity of the day. Surrounded by a class of enthralled seven year olds, my teacher wipes the glass with a damp paper towel and asks for suggestions on how we might fix a loose hinge on the lid. My classmates are full of ideas, but I am silent and sick to my stomach.

Later that day I am lying on the rug, eating coffee yogurt and watching CatDog when my babysitter comes in with the phone in her hand. I didn’t even hear it ring, but apparently my teacher is on the phone.

 “Katherine?”

Her voice sounds very soft and far away. I try to pretend I’m not sure what this call is about.

“You’ll never believe what happened to me this afternoon.”

I am standing barefoot in my backyard and the rocks are cool and scratchy on my skin.

“I stayed after school to put the new tank together, and it was all ready for your frog.”

“Oh… you did?”  I am feeling very sorry both for her and for myself.

“But then I reached in, all still and careful so I didn’t scare him, and when I touched him—when I touched him, he was made of plastic.”

She falls silent, and I am well-aware that my great trick has come to an end; there is nothing further I can do to keep the frog alive. Unwilling to pursue it any further now that the magic of the situation has been deflated, I am backed into the inevitable corner of The Truth. Eager to escape this mortifying conversation as soon as possible, I stammer, in what feels like a complete cop-out,

“But… but… the people at the pet store said it was real..”

I’m not sure if I’m trying to get out of trouble or whether I am simply too embarrassed to admit to the tale I’ve told. Either way, my response has the intended effect of making my teacher stop talking about it. After I say this, the conversation remains gentle and quiet but ends relatively quickly.

Later that week, my teacher calls my mom to express her concern that I am struggling with reality. Her exact words are that I am “having some trouble distinguishing reality from fiction.”

I don’t know if my mom realizes the extent to which I carried The Frog Trick; she is perfectly comfortable with my grasp on reality and is more sympathetic to my obvious desperation for a pet.

Two weeks later, we get a real tree frog. Christened Frisky due to his spastic jumping behaviors, he lives a solid five years and is well-loved by the Frog Master.

Just because my softball team lost over 150 games in a row is no reason to scrunch up your nose at me. You don’t even know me!

I bet your softball team doesn’t have two professional Latinists. I bet your softball team doesn’t drink delicious Grain Belt Premium beer. I bet your softball team doesn’t practice in the dead of winter on a frozen lake in the sub-zero temperatures of Minnesota with no gloves or hats while listening to Polka music!

Is your team sponsored by a local bar featuring an Italian meat sandwich with a racist name? Did your team of 40+ y/o men have a “parent night” where Moms and Dads traveled from other states to receive their complimentary bumper sticker that said “My son plays softball”?

Did you ever have a player get so excited that he ran to third base instead of first? And then kept going into left field and eventually into the parking lot and off to the bar, screaming the entire time? Did that ever happen with one of your guys? Was his name George?

No, for you, it is always about the 150 game losing streak, isn’t it? Maybe you never considered the streaks of blood running down our arms and legs as we put our very own bodies in harms way in the spirit of softball? What about the time Zin broke his nose on the fly ball? Remember that?

No, you don’t remember that because you were playing for some other softball team. One that wins games every now and again. So good for you. I’m proud of you. And your accomplishment.

But I’ll tell you this: I won the list serve lottery on the same day I got my notice that the fees are due for another year of softball and I’ll be damned if one of the emails made my heart flutter just a bit and the other made me more paranoid and angry.

I am a winner, but not the kind either of us want me to be. You want me to be the “write up the cute story about your bad softball team” kind of listserve winner and I want to be the ""guy who actually wins softball games"" kind of softball winner.

And now as I wrap up this email it looks like neither of us get what we want.

So there.

After studying (communication design) and working in various places in Europe (all being lovely) I set my sails to North America last summer, packed my bags and moved to Vancouver. Here, they call British Columbia “The most beautiful place on earth”. It’s pretty, don’t get me wrong — but who would ever think they’re entitled to that phrase?

I moved over here to study. After working in the advertising industry for a few years, I felt like taking on new and different challenges. Go a bit more back to a human centred approach. In my opinion, great things happen when you start using design to educate, enlighten and raise people’s interest in certain topics, rather then just to make something for the sake of making pretty things. (Even though that can be fun too).

I’ve always been fascinated by perception, the way our brains work, how we memorise and take in information—which is directly related to my even bigger interest in reading. Digital media has changed all that. We live in a time where distractions abound and never run out. The Internet has had a momentous impact, similar to Gutenberg’s printing press in the fifteenth century, and sparked an information revolution. Information is just a click away and we want as much as possible, as quickly as possible. The so called “linear mind” is now a thing of the past. Reading habits and information processing are changing, with reading skills and comprehension declining simultaneously. The problem is especially apparent with teenage boys all over the world. Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests show that reading comprehension of boys is lower than girls in all 65 countries tested.

So what’s going on? Are books not able to compete to the various interactive, instant-rewarding digital media that surrounds us? If books aren’t able to compete for attention any more, how do they need to evolve? How can we get those kids to dive back into books?

If you feel like sharing any thoughts, advice, or random Björk stories,I would be most delighted to hear from you.

Have a glorious day!

February 2015,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/02/01/improv-is-magic/,"February 2015, 01",Improv is magic,"I'm passionate about a lot of things; music (I'm a classical/contemporary clarinet and bass clarinet player by trade), acting, writing, cooking, the environment, teaching, etc, but for me there is a unifying theory to be found in improv. Improvising music and movement has made me a better and more confident performer, but improvising theatre has made me a better and more confident person.

 Theatre improv (think ""whose line"" or UCB) has within it all of the basic elements that you need to be a good and successful person. You know the ones- saying yes and supporting ideas, always having people's backs, paying attention (really paying attention), finding what's working and doing it again and again, being brave enough to burst into song or dance, or just get up in front of people and feel comfortable and even excited speaking. All of the things that a lot of us feel bad at, as if we somehow missed the all-important day in school where they taught everybody how to talk to each other and not be weird about it and we're never going to catch up because of it. I grew up shy and awkward, and improv has made me feel like a real and whole person- I'm happy on stage, I'm happy pushing my own ideas to a group, I'm happy making small talk with strangers, and I'm happy collaborating with artists from any discipline. It's a huge thing.

If you'd like to try something new, I highly recommend an improv course. You'll start with little, easy exercises- saying ""yes and"" to ideas, maybe playing games where you can only ask questions, alternate saying words with another person, tell a story collectively etc. They all seem little, but they add up to something big, and you'll be amazed at the high you get when it goes well. You'll find yourself responding without censoring yourself, contributing ideas that you can't even remember having, and connecting to your classmates and the characters they create. You might also do some 'long form' things, like playing out scenes and linking them together- this is where the paying attention thing comes in handy! If a course sounds like a bit much, or you don't live near one, try this- say yes to everything (within reason), and then say ""yes and""... add something! You'll have a much more positive day, I promise.

Lastly, if you're a performer of any kind- music, dance, anything, learn to improvise. Just do it. It doesn't matter what discipline you're in or whether you strictly need to be able to improvise (lots of classical musicians would wet themselves if you put them on stage and just said go), you'd be amazed what it can do for your practise. I love using improv (along with other tools) to make help fellow musicians and students feel more at home on stage, and play more expressively, and it can work for you too.

I'd love to hear from any improvising people out there, in any discipline, especially if you like to do interdisciplinary work.

Look out for my hilarious improv troupe, improvable (facebook / improvable), we've got some great gigs coming up in London and Edinburgh!

I teach clarinet and offer performance coaching to any instrument (or ensembles) in London UK- hit me up!

January 2015,31,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/01/31/the-rose-bush/,"January 2015, 31",The Rose Bush,"Growing along a garden gate was a beautiful bush of yellow roses. Every day was sunny and beautiful, and the rose bush blossomed.

As the days passed, she grew big and beautiful delighting in the joy she brought to the people who walked by her gate. The perfume from her yellow buds swept through the neighborhood on the afternoon breeze coaxing smiles from even those of a melancholy nature. Her spirit was optimistic and saw the positive even in a rainy day.

After a time the rose bush became too overgrown. Her limbs heavy with her beautiful buds and their delightful fragrance. But also those shrewd thorns that snag unwary fingers.

So as the afternoon began to wane, the Gardener brought out His pruning shears and began to cut away some of the growth.

The rose bush wept for her lost limbs, the beautiful buds and even those shrewd thorns. For they had been part of her.

As He worked the Gardener whispered in her ear, ""Shhh, my beautiful rose bush. Be brave. For though the pain is sharp right now, one day this pain will make you stronger and more beautiful than ever.""

The moon began to climb across the sky when He finished and left her in the night air with the pieces of her scattered at her feet and her heart broken. While the crickets chirped their part of the night symphony, she mourned what she had just lost, feeling every missing leaf and thorn so keenly that it was hard to breathe.

When the symphony finished and dawn began to break along the horizon, the rose bush thought about what the Gardener had said and what He had promised. With the first rays of the morning sun warming what was left of her, she began to hope.

It was my way of expressing the pain and frustration I felt without explicitly saying what was happening. Infertility is a sensitive subject. At the time I didn’t want to share with anyone outside my husband and immediate family what we were going through. Partly because I didn’t want to broadcast that we were trying to get pregnant. Despite how easy it is to share everything in our lives these days, not everything is meant to be shared with everyone.

Writing has always been my catharsis. Whenever I’m experiencing a particularly difficult time, I find I work through my emotions best when I write about them. It can come in the form of poetry, short story, or letter. Sometimes, I learn about feelings I didn’t realize I had. It doesn’t always happen right away, but eventually I will feel better and have more clarity on my situation.

Shortly after I published the above story on my blog, we were told our chances of conceiving on our own were 25% at best. (Compared to the 85% chance couples without infertility problems have.) We started to make plans with a fertility specialist. And then we found out I was pregnant. Our daughter is now almost two, and I’m pregnant with our second child (due in July). Life is good.

Please don't take someone you love for granted. Forgetting the thrill of those early years is as easy as falling asleep. Don't let it happen. I allowed myself to become unhappy, and I refused to work to understand why, and I utterly failed someone that I loved. I lost the most singular thing I ever had.

That was years and years ago. She's fine now, I think. Most of my friends have learned to forget it, and I am lucky--absurdly lucky!--to once again count myself loved. It took a long time, but I like my life again.

But the dreams about her are the giveaway, still there on way too many nights. I suspect they always will be. It would do no good, and probably quite a lot of bad, to tell this to anyone but internet strangers (hello there).

Maybe someday I will  concoct a story about it all being part of a grander plan. That sounds pretty nice!

For now, please believe me when I tell you that some losses are permanent; that the ability to imagine yourself the hero of your own story is among these; and that there is no reason you must face any of this if you take time to care for yourself and those who love you. Hurting someone else can hurt you more than you might think.

I know, I know: more unsolicited life advice from the Listserve. Sorry. Given the opportunity, it's hard not to use this chance to share the most important thing you know. 

Thanks for your time and for taking this seriously. Now go cheer yourself up, you deserve it. I hear good things about YouTube.

I'm pretty excited to be able to write to all of you. I've been on the Listserve since April 18th 2012. This is the first time I win the lottery.

There are two things I thought about writing when I would win the Listserve lottery: how to introduce yourself to 24 101 strangers and how many of my friends are also on Listserve.

As an introduction, here is something about me.I like to run. When I started training in 2013, it became a real passion. In 2014 I did two half marathons (2h23m and 2h29m). I plan to run three of them this year. I'm on a roll! :-)

To all my friends who just learned I won the Listserve, here is a couple words for them in french: il y en a combien d'entre-vous qui sont inscrit? Je suis curieux de le savoir!

On a closing note. One of my favorite quote comes from the TV show Mad Men: “If you don't like what is being said, change the conversation” - Don Draper

Keep rocking!

When I started my freshman year of high school, making friends was my biggest worry. That had always been difficult for me—I was introverted and awkward. I trudged to classes unaccompanied, ate meals alone, and avoided conversation. A few weeks into the school year, however, everything changed.

I was studying in the library when, all of a sudden, a girl loudly called to me from across the room: “Hey! You in the blue shirt! Don’t I know you from choir?”I looked up, confused. “Um…yeah. I…uh…think so. I’m Adam.”

The girl wasn’t fazed by my uncomfortable reply. Instead, she skipped over to me, introduced herself as Abby, and invited me to join her and some friends in a group planning an act for the school talent show. Taken by surprise, I timidly agreed.

We left immediately for the music building. She skipped. I, somewhat embarrassed by her sprightliness, trailed behind. We found a practice room, and four other singers soon joined us. Hours went by as the group of us attempted to learn the act. Eventually, everyone departed but Abby and me. We abandoned the song-learning pursuit. Instead, Abby pulled a huge binder out of her backpack. “Do you like show tunes?” she asked. I couldn’t contain my excitement. We spent the rest of the afternoon playing through the binder, which was full of Broadway sheet music. I learned that Abby had synesthesia; when she heard notes, she saw corresponding colors. Music was her lifeblood—it was mine too. By dinnertime, we were already wondering aloud how we had managed to live so long without each other. The connection was undeniable, and it only deepened from there.

Over the rest of the year, Abby and I were inseparable. We ate our meals together, studied in the library together, and spent our weekends together. Abby was the first person I completely trusted. She was also the first person to whom I came out as gay. When I told her, I started shaking. She brought me into a long, warm hug. Even now, I think about how safe and happy I felt in that moment. Abby helped me to find the confidence I needed to accept myself for who I was. She taught me not to worry about what other people thought of me, and she taught me to enjoy self-expression.

Unfortunately, Abby and I grew apart as high school went on. Although we stayed acquaintances, we lost the intimate connection that had filled me with so much joy. Homework, romance, and extracurricular pursuits had managed to wedge themselves between us—I have never been able to truly understand how. What I do know is that, when the friendship started to decline, I did nothing to revive it. Because our relationship had started so naturally and spontaneously, I had erroneously assumed that our connection would never weaken. I had forgotten that friendships require the effort of both parties in order to stay strong. And that is one of my biggest regrets: I let our friendship die.

I recently started to reach out to Abby again in the hopes of rekindling our friendship. Hopefully we will be able to reestablish our bonds. It will take some effort, but I know it will be worth it. Friendship, after all, is worth fighting for.

January 2015,27,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/01/27/bar-etiquette/,"January 2015, 27",Bar etiquette,"Hi Listserve!

Like everyone else, I never really expected to win this lottery, but here I am with circa 24K willing recipients.

So what am I going to use my platform for? All GOOD, of course. I'm going to give you some advice on being a better customer in a bar. See, I moonlight as a bartender (I run the Manhattans Project, a little cocktail popup in London (@ManhattansPRJCT)), and I love great customers.

But isn’t the customer's always right? Nope. The customer is never wrong, but they sure as heck aren't as right as they could be. Very few drinkers know their spirits, liqueurs, how to balance a cocktail, what fruit is great that week, and what drinks a bar does best. Your bartender does.

Firstly, stop ordering mojitos.

Let me preface this by saying the mojito can be a glorious drink, but it's my bête noire. On a hot day, made well, it’s really up there. It’s just, mostly, people don’t drink them like that. They order them in a panic at a bar, and the bartender gets some tired mint, some halfway decent rum, a squeeze of lime, some sugar and throws them in a glass with a handful of crushed ice. Then the drink gets topped up with soda and you’re left with something that’s…reliably drinkable, but consistently mediocre.

Too often, it’s ordered by people put off by over pretentious drinks menu, who begrudgingly pay £7. They’ve been put off other classic cocktails by warm, oily martinis and cosmopolitans made with sour mix, so they’ll take this. It’s long enough to feel like good value, and generally inoffensive.

Which brings me on to my second suggestion. Find a bartender you like, trust, and maybe want to bang. That bartender will look after you; they will show you magical new drinks and tell you stories and anecdotes that will make you the life of any party. They probably won't sleep with you. Sorry.

Once you have that bartender, make them work. Talk to them about what you like. Tell them why you've never quite got on with scotch, or gin, or fernet branca. They'll try to persuade you, and sometimes they'll succeed. Other times, you'll learn a bunch about what you like, and that's only a good thing. Ask them what they're drinking at the moment, or what's new in the bar. See if they want to preview you some drinks from the new menu, or test a new concoction on you. They probably do, and your life will be better for it. Just don't order an old fashioned if they're rushed off their feet.

Thirdly, tip. Tip early and often. You've come out for a nice drink. Don't scrimp on this...you'll probably make it back in generous pours, buy backs (when the bartender gets you a shot) and fast service. You'll be welcomed back and you'll get to crash the occasional lock-in at the bar and find out all the gossip bartender confidentiality allows. Bartenders don't make rockstar salaries, and we rely on tips to put the jam on our toast. Look after us, and we'll look after you. This is the hospitality industry, after all.

Finally, don't gender your drinks! Don't ask your bartender for a 'girly' drink, or a 'manly' shot. You look like an ass, and everyone around you thinks you're being sexist. Turns out flavours don't have genders, and your bartender is going to laugh at you for thinking they do.

That's it from me. Enjoy your listserve subs, and next time you have a Manhattan, send me a toast from wherever you are in the world. Thanks for listening!

We were there to stay until the work was done. And this changed everything.What Steve did was different. This was the mid-90’s in Cape Town, South Africa, and I was experiencing for the first time what it meant to be part of a team heading toward success. It’s incredible what a room of people all believing the same thing can achieve together and it felt analogous to the change the entire country was experiencing at that time too.I am still not sure what caused me to start writing down notes about Steve and the people around me, but I did. In the years since that first project I have had the pleasure of working alongside thousands of people across 35 countries and continued to take notes on observed behavior that led to moments of meaning and significance.For all of you kind Listserve people, here’s a glance at a few of the best from over 450 notes captured in the past 20 years about people who helped others, gave hope, achieved success and created something important.It is more important to try and be the best street sweeper in the world than being an average boss. Avoid the Peter Principle.

The more compressed a message is, the further it can travel.

Using an oil tanker for water skiing won’t work. Scaled operating models break speed operating models, and vice versa. Speed can grow to become scaled.

When you’re leading you do not have the option of having a bad day. You have to be excited about what’s happening before others have the propensity to feel the same.

Proximity beats hierarchy every time.

Nobody can change the culture of a group (things people do when no-one is looking). Instead, start something nearby in a new environment and with a different purpose that celebrates success often. People will gravitate towards it by themselves. Success is contagious.

You cannot unpunch someone.

There are only three conditions that cause a person to stall: they don't understand what to do, they disagree with the direction or raw “lizard brain” fear. Have genuine concern and fix the situation, not the person.

Being supported is a satisfier. Helping others is a motivator. Until you’ve helped someone else, you’ve never really helped yourself.

Nose in, hands out. Micro management dents dignity and destroys creativity.

The bigger your role in an organization, the more you need to ask: “what can I do to help you?” Also the quieter your tone and the more deliberate your words should be.

If you have to dive into a sea of sharks, bring fish.

And finally; every person in this world has a story, things they want to do in their life and something they care a lot about. Even the shyest of people can ask, “where are you from?” and “what brought you here?”

What else? What are the best things you’ve seen happen in business or in life that changed everything? I’d love to hear them.I’ve been considering writing a book to capture all of the notes I have so far and adding some additional explanation and examples for each. Is that something you’d be interested in reading?

Thank you for making every day a school day and daring to make a difference.

January 2015,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/01/22/feelings-are-hard/,"January 2015, 22",feelings are hard,"When I was a kid, I didn't have many friends. I didn't talk to many people about how I was doing, or what was going on for me. My childhood wasn't bad (it was actually pretty great), I just never talked about myself. As I got older, it got harder to talk about myself or my feelings. It was even hard to talk about what I wanted.

That's normally not an issue. It didn't matter much if I was happy, sad, or frustrated in math class. It didn't matter if I was excited or ashamed at work. Just do the things and keep moving.

Being able to express feelings only really matters in relationships with people. Unfortunately for me, it turns out that relationships with people are everywhere. Not just romantic relationships, but also friendships and family relationships. Relationships with teachers and coworkers. Even my relationship with myself. Everything seems easier for people who know what they feel, and can talk about it.

I didn't know how to tell people what I was feeling. I barely knew how to tell myself what I was feeling. I couldn't ask for what I wanted. I often couldn't even understand other people's feelings when they were telling them to me straight up. Needless to say I had a string of frustrating romances. How could a romance work for me if I didn't even know how to say what I wanted?

It was almost by accident that I learned about Non-Violent Communication, a method of talking to people about my own feelings and theirs. A friend was taking some classes in it, and I went along. At first it was hard for me to get into. It's a bit hokey; it feels stilted to talk using a formal system. But it helped.

The empathic listening exercises we did really helped me to understand other people when they told me what they felt. I listened to people talk about their feelings, and for the first time really was able to understand that other people are different than me. People are different, and that's awesome. I was able to support people in their sad feelings and celebrate with them in their happy feelings.

Learning to listen empathically was great, but being listened to was world-changing. It's a freeing feeling when someone you've built up trust with over weeks of classes says they're listening to you. At first it was hard to say what I felt. Then it was harder. 

As I started to talk about some things that made me sad, to really say how I felt, my body went cold. I felt dizzy. My hands were freezing and my face was hot. I was shaking and crying. And the people listening didn't hate me or shun me for it. I just got a good hug, and I got to cry about something that mattered to me.

After that it got easier. It's still not easy, but I can talk about it when I'm sad. I can tell people if they bother me, instead of avoiding them completely. I can show people when I'm happy, or when I'm sad, or even when I'm angry.

There's power and freedom in being able to recognize and express your feelings. It's a freedom that's been hard for me to find as a man in American society. It's a power that I didn't even know I had.

I will do the best to encompass his ability to tell stories, and by doing so I will tell a piece of his story.

One of my dad’s favorite tales to tell is the first time I rode a rollercoaster. This love affair began when I was little and my family took a trip to Virginia. All day I had been asking to go on a rollercoaster. It intrigued me the way that they twirled in the air and screams of laughter rang from within. This was something I needed to try for myself, but I was just too short. Finally, we came across “The Big Bad Wolf”. The name sounds far more intimidating than it was, and after further inspection, this was the one. I was just barely tall enough if I stood on my tippy-toes. We made our ascent to the top, whooshing through the ride, spilling out with laughter and screaming. Then, the ride began to go up another hill that was twice as big as before. My eyes began to grow to the size of a silver dollar and I instantly doubted my love affair with rollercoasters. When we reached the summit I remember looking at my dad and saying “Holy $#*%!!!”. We raced down the remaining portion of the track and plummeted to the bottom. When the ride ended, my dad feared what I would say next, but all I said was, “let’s do that again!” And so began my love affair with rollercoasters.

These were the happy days spent with my dad. Days full of abundant smiles, joy, and overwhelming peace. Recently, those bright days began to turn dark and my dad developed a new love affair with alcohol. He quickly became an alcoholic and couldn’t function without first wrapping his arms around a bottle of whiskey. My beautiful, happy family began to come apart at the seams due to my dad’s disease, and there was no way of mending the damage. We continued on without admitting to our fault by putting on a happy face. One day, it became too much. Words were said that should have never been spoken to someone you love and I begged my dad to come back into my life. He had become such an absent figure that I felt as if I had been abandoned and was an orphan. I had lost all hope and doubted I would ever have him back in my life.

December 6th, 2014 my dad went to a rehab facility and it forever changed our lives. He went through a 30-day treatment and began to discover his alcoholism with a clear mind. He remembered the person he used to be back in the bright days and rediscovered his carefree charisma. Day-by-day the man that I used to admire and love returned. Slowly, he became my best friend again and the light began to shine through.

My dad will forever be an alcoholic, but he is consistently fighting and overcoming the disease. He is such an example of redemption, transformation, and never giving up hope. My encouragement to you is that if you or someone you know are fighting this disease or something similar, please seek help. Discover light and the overwhelming peace that can be restored. Never give up on endlessly praying and fighting for something that you believe in, even if it seems overwhelming. I would love to hear your stories and for you to know that you are not alone.

If you plead guilty, I get paid double, and you'll get out of jail.”","“Hi! I'm your lawyer. If you plead guilty, I get paid double, and you'll get out of jail.”

In the USA, if you are criminally charged and too poor to hire a lawyer, then the government is required to provide you with an attorney. The myriad processes vary from state to state, county to county, and even from court to court.

There are two ways that government provides representation to the poor: either a public defender office, or an appointed attorney plan. A public defender might be funded by the state or the county. They will have a support staff, such as secretaries and investigators. Their lawyers are paid salaries, with benefits. They struggle under very large caseloads and long hours. Often, it is difficult for a defendant to be considered poor enough to qualify for their services.

A jurisdiction without any public defender office may use a less expensive appointed attorney system, where attorneys in private practice are assigned to assist poor defendants. Those attorneys are paid a very nominal fee. That fee often doesn't cover gasoline, parking, and dry cleaning. Lawyers participating in appointed attorney systems often rely on doing a volume business, to avoid losing money.Some jurisdictions have few formal requirements for a lawyer to take such cases. The lawyer might not be required to have any secretary or staff. She may not be required to have an office, or malpractice insurance.

The judge of the court may manage the appointments and approve the payments according to the judge's priorities. Those priorities may vary by judge. Some are concerned with justice and good representation. Others focus on attorney availability, quick pleas to move the case, friendship, campaign considerations, etc.

Appointed attorneys in most jurisdictions are not paid until the case is concluded. Payment can be an unvarying fee that may not change depending on the amount or quality of work done, or the result of the case. In one local county, an attorney will be paid the very same $100.00 total fee if he concludes a case instantly by a quick guilty plea, or if he must return to court ten times to get the case dismissed. A jailed defendant's release is routinely promised, in exchange for a “voluntary” plea.

In that same county, there are other formal written rules that double the fee to a lawyer who persuades his client to plead guilty to a felony at the first appearance, and halve that same fee to the lawyer who instead persuades the prosecutor to dismiss the felony. Even a conscientious and zealous advocate must have his advice to his client subconsciously influenced by payment systems that reward an attorney for bad results.

There are too many lawyers. They owe too much money. Many come out of law school owing $150,000.00 or more. There are few jobs available for an average law graduate. They are paid very little, often less than a fast food manager. Lawyers who can't get a job, or are between jobs, may try to make ends meet by taking appointed cases.

Some defendants hire lawyers. Those defendants should remember that lawyers are only required to take one bar exam. They then can then practice nearly all areas of law. Criminal defense, personal injury, probate, divorce, and business law are as dissimilar to each other as podiatry, cardiology, ophthalmology, psychiatry and gynecology. You wouldn't see a proctologist because of a hearing problem. You shouldn't hire your divorce lawyer for your criminal case.

Many states provide specialty certification to lawyers, just as they do to doctors. Hiring a certified criminal defense specialist may be your best bet if faced with criminal charges.

From 14 to 21, I was in a relationship with a person I still consider ""one of the best guys I've ever known."" In that span of 7 years, loving him was all-consuming: from spending everyday together in high school, to following him to college, to finally moving in together. We settled into comfortable. What should’ve been a period of individual growth and self-discovery was instead a catalyst to codependence. We had no interests outside of each other so we continued, year after year, growing older together but not growing up.

Around the 7-year mark, he started asking his engaged friends how they knew they were ready to propose. I knew instantly that he wasn't asking because he was ready, but because after 7 years together… he was trying to shake the feeling that he didn't want to propose to me. He had accepted a truth I was too stubborn (scared?) to face: we weren't right for each other.

When I finally lost him, I went through a process of completely losing myself and I truly did lose a lot...

My moralsMy judgmentMy inhibitionsMy excuses

I tried desperately to shed everything that made me “me” because I never knew a me without “us.” I was safe when I was with him. Without him, I took up climbing, rappelling, scuba diving, skydiving, cliff jumping, backpacking, couch surfing, partying, hiking, drinking, traveling…

I pursued adventures obsessively- partially to distract from the emptiness, but mostly in an attempt to prove that I could be someone… someone interesting… without him. I just didn't know who that was. I searched for myself at the top of mountains. I searched for myself at the bottom of oceans. I even searched for myself at the bottom of many, many, many bottles of tequila. And when I found nothing, I searched again. I climbed. I jumped. I dove. I fell. I did this over and over again secretly hoping someone else would catch me. No one did.

It's been 2 years and I'm just now learning to catch myself. I don't feel the need to prove anything anymore. At 23, I accept that I've done a lot on my own in 2 years- traveled to 14 countries, jumped off the world's highest bungee bridge, brought healthcare to impoverished communities, swam with sharks, completed a Master's degree- none of which I would've done if I had stayed safe or comfortable. I honestly don’t know who I would’ve been if I hadn’t loved him, but I do know that I wouldn’t be who I am today if I hadn’t lost him. I'm making a promise to myself that once I send this out into the world... I'm finally going to let go.

Thank you for being my catharsis.

----------------------------------

In a lot of ways, sending this email in all it's messy, emotional glory felt a lot scarier than jumping off any plane ever did. When I won, I honestly debated sending out a copy of my resume and calling it a day (sorry!! That's the very sad reality of a job-seeking Masters student) but I'm glad this came out. That said, if anyone has a job opening for someone with an MPH in Global Public Health, a 4.0 GPA, in-field healthcare experience around the world (including Europe, Central America, and Africa), and an extensive background in scientific research, teaching, writing, and clinical care -- I'm your girl.

Or if you want to talk about heartbreak or travel or adventure, I'm up for that too.

I have been a part of the Listserve for almost 5 years. There have been several times when I wanted to be chosen. Now I am sitting in the country of Jordan caught totally surprised by the email saying I won. I had always hoped I would be doing something memorable when I got the email. The first draft of this email was very different. Then I heard a story about a Syrian Refugee that I wanted to share.  

A volunteer went to a Syrian family over a year and a half ago. There was a 5 year old boy who had experienced bombing  while fleeing the country. The volunteer tried to get the boy to play but he just stayed catatonic. From then on the volunteer held the boy in his arms every time he visited. This went on for about 6 months. Then the volunteer brought a ball and put it in the boy's hand. Nothing happened till the boy dropped the ball. It didn't bounce but stayed on the ground for a few seconds before shooting across the room. The boy chased after it and started showing emotion for the first time. All it took was love and human affection to work over time. That and the servant willing to share God's love.

As the Syrian conflict gets less coverage in the news, it is easy for the refugees to be forgotten. I am currently working with them in the Middle East. On a personal level, I could urge you to to volunteer to help refugees here in the Middle East or in your own country. I could urge you to give money or pray. What I will ask you to do is not just think about the refugees and move on. 

Now on to me. My name is Micah Jordan. I am currently 20 years old, in my 3rd year of college studying communication and history are small private college in Missouri. But I was born in South Korea, lived there 8 years then Manila Philippines for 8 years. I am called a third culture kid or TCK. If you want to know more google it. Being a TCK has impacted my perspective on the world. I have gotten do so many things like fly an airplane before driving a car. For sake of space I can't elaborate. If you would like to know more please email me. I love talking about my life experiences.

Writing is very difficult you see.  Over 4 years ago I developed what specialists ambiguously call ""overuse syndrome"". Unofficially thoracic outlet syndrome and occupational dystonia, brought on mostly by too much computer use.

I am constant pain with limited ability to do things with my hands, especially in a repetitive fashion.  I can still take care of myself  but anything computer, tablet, or phone related is especially problematic.   I cannot even begin to explain the ways this has negatively affected my career (which I had to give up) and personal life. I can only share some things I learned along the way.

Exercise matters. Movement matters. Nutrition matters.  I grew up thinking that exercise was a lifestyle choice. That movement beyond the basics was optional. Being slim I thought I didn't need to exercise or care about what I ate. That was for losing weight right? Or for people who are into sports.  I was into reading or drawing or spending countless hours on the computer.

Movement is critical for human health though. It just IS.  You can't sit most of the day and expect your body to maintain FULL range of motion, functional alignment and healthy muscle tone.  Your body needs to walk and lift and carry and bend and climb and do a million other things that we don't do in our cubicles.

There are others that explain this way better than I can.  Like Katy Bowman. She's amazing.  I'm halfway through her book Move your DNA. I strongly recommend this to every human being out there.

All computer users should read 'Its Not Carpal Tunnel Syndrome' , also 'Pain Free' by Peter Egoscue.  For any kind of pain 'The Trigger Point Workbook' by Clair Davies.

As far as food goes 'Deep Nutrition' by Dr Cate Shanahan blew my mind.  Also check out 'Latest In Paleo' podcast even if you are not into paleo. Host Angelo Copolla is thoughtful, eloquent and unbiased.  I can't recommend it enough.

I'm excited by the Food Is Free project.  Also Ron Finley of South Central LA deserves a serious shout out.  Google his website and Ted Talk.  We need more people like this.

I wish I had a success story that included how these challenges led to great changes in my life.  How I found an awesome new life path, or cured my ailments and now help others, or even met an amazing guy to start a family with and live happily ever after.

Unfortunately I can say none of those things.   But I keep looking.  And so should you.

If you are in pain don't give up.  Keep trying new things.  And get your body moving, however you can.

I'd love to hear from anyone that has had success dealing with RSI or TOS in particular.If anyone knows of any fantastic physical therapy places..  health retreats..   where can one go to restore alignment and movement and function and strength?   Where can one live amidst nature with an actual real community and grow and build things?   I just want to get better and help others and be a part of something meaningful and exciting.  But I don't know how.  Is that too much to ask for?

PS, this email is made possible by Google speech. Please, people of Google, keep working on ways to make technology more hands free.  Speech recognition helps,  but it needs so much more improvement   The less the human race has to type and hunch over devices the better..  Thank you.

January 2015,14,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/01/14/war-and-peace-and-publishing/,"January 2015, 14",War and Peace and Publishing,"I first saw Heat in December of 1995. During the now-famous diner scene, Pacino’s character tells De Niro’s: “So you never wanted a regular-type life, huh?” To which the latter replies: “What the fuck is that? Barbecues and ball games?” I could relate.

I was a plebe on winter leave from the United States Military Academy, a.k.a. West Point, sometimes colloquially known among disaffected cadets as the South Hudson Institute of Technology. (We like acronyms. You figure it out.) I’m a corporate brat; I’d lived in a parade of bland suburban homes in Chicago, Orlando, and Toronto. I wanted something else. Maybe war, maybe drama, maybe craziness.

As a firstie, I was diagnosed with narcolepsy. This was 1999; the Army gave me my diploma and let me go.

By 2000, I was in Columbia University’s journalism school. In the fall, we watched, incredulous, as Bush-vs.-Gore played out. In the spring, I ended up in a very small seminar, taught by Al Gore. Our first class with him was his first public appearance after conceding the most hotly contested presidential election in U.S. history. Life seemed as bizarre as it could be.

Then 9/11 happened. I’d already left New York for Chicago; I was working in the Sears Tower—the only 100-story building in the country that wasn’t hit by airplanes that day. (Granted, my desk was only on the 6th floor.) We had to evacuate.

When the wars started, I felt guilty that I wasn’t in the Army. I thought I’d abandoned my destiny. I made feeble plans to fly to Kuwait in February of 2003 and tag along as a war correspondent. Nothing came together. In 2004, I interviewed for a position with the C.I.A. I was rejected. I wrote a book I was convinced was the Great American Novel. It didn’t go anywhere.

Around then, I got sober. I also became a Christian pacifist.

Life grew relatively more sedate. I got sick of the corporate world, got fired, worked in food service, and ended up back in the corporate world. I wrote another book, Resistance, about the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Prague in 1942. I shopped it traditionally and got some enthusiastic responses from agents, but nothing happened.

In 2012, my girlfriend got pregnant, and I launched my own book imprint, Tortoise Books. I funded Resistance with a Kickstarter. (If you get a chance, Google “Brennan Resistance Kickstarter.” I’m told it’s a funny video.) My classmates contributed generously, and it succeeded. I launched the book in May, got married in July, and we had a daughter in September.

When the Kickstarter succeeded, I felt like George Bailey at the end of It’s a Wonderful Life.

When my daughter was born…I can’t describe it.

I’m thrilled about independent publishing. During my prior struggles, I’d read The Myth of Sisyphus by Camus. I could relate. My gut told me I wasn’t the only one. When I recruited my first author, the very talented Giano Cromley, it turned out he had a tattoo of Sisyphus rolling the boulder. I’m proud of our books, and of our two new authors (Darrin Doyle and Rachel Slotnick), and of others on the scene: Joseph G. Peterson, Ben Tanzer, et. al.

Still, Tortoise Books isn’t paying the bills. So I’m otherwise living a regular-type-life. Which is perfectly fine. Some of the most mundane moments can be satisfying, if you’re at peace: watching TMZ with my wife, reading to my daughter, seeing my son smile. So to everyone out there, whether you’re contemplating jihad or just scribbling cartoons, all I can say is: peace.

My name is Dan Shipton. I am a father to a wonderful 5 year old boy and the CEO of Change, a small startup based in Des Moines, Iowa. Thanks for reading my contribution to the Listserve project.

For me, 2014 was a shitty, get your teeth knocked in over and over kind of year. I focused most of my attention on saving a marriage that ultimately wasn’t meant to be at the expense of everything else. Basically, my life has been in maintenance mode for longer than I’d like to admit. So when I received the “You’ve Won!” email I literally laughed out loud — are there any worthwhile words I possibly write to 25k strangers?

I had resigned to not write anything, but was gently reminded how I got this far in life by a couple word magnets strung together on the side of a fridge at my office. Those words struck a chord with me today and I want to share them with you: “build to win big”

Building is something I’ve always been good at. Deliberately making the life I wanted for myself (and family). Letting people drift out of my life who I had outgrown and adding new ones in that would encourage me to be a better person. Same philosophy applied to work and the various projects I’ve been a part of. Grow, reinvent, stop doing what isn’t working. I’ve made a lot of personal progress over the last three decades following those rules.

Somewhere in the last few years, that intentional building of my life was slowly replaced by complacency, the status quo and hanging onto things I should let fade. But 2015 will hold a different outcome for myself. Now that you’ve all played a small part in getting me unstuck, it is time to go build to win big. Thanks for listening.

The fragrance of flowery shisha smoke from a nearby coffee shop punctuates the air.  We drink beer and pass around a bottle of whiskey while we wait for Ahmed and Mido to arrive.

Arriving at the stables in the desert, somewhat outside of the city itself, I can see the pyramids in the distance. Their shape blocking out the city lights in perfect triangle cut-outs. The stable master gestures for us to pick out our horses. I pass a few, most backing away from me, before arriving at a majestic looking white mare.We mount and head into the night. Only five minutes out, blackness surrounds us on all sides, save for the dunes and craggy rock glistening in the light of the full moon. We trot slowly for thirty minutes as we move over increasingly inclined terrain. I look back and see the view getting more and more vast behind me. I can see a fire in the distance, men who make camp fire tea for night riders. We dismount and order a tea each, sharp tasting and pungent, complimenting a joint being passed between us.

With hashish and alcohol pumping through my veins, the smell of of a camp fire playing at my nose and the taste of smoky tea still stinging my tongue, I lay back on the the soft sands and stare at the infinite universe laid out before me. I've never seen stars so clearly before. The milky way flows above while I contemplate life and the human condition. I feel at peace. The greatest city in the world to my right, bright and alive. And the pyramids, which I think must be the work of creatures from a far flung galaxy, to my left. Silently, I wax philosophic, challenging old ideals and creating new ones, turning everything I've ever been taught about life on its head. I'm roused from my state by Tariq telling me it's time to head back. Mounted on my horse once more, we canter while I run through the things I've just seen in my mind. We begin to gallop, moving in unison while the wind whips through my hair. My heart is pounding in my throat and I feel alive, my senses sharpening, adrenaline replacing the calm that drugs had brought on. We race, my horse and I, my breathing matching hers. We round a dune and the glory that is Cairo comes into full view. Awe overtakes me. The frigid night air pricks at my skin and I realize that this very moment in time could have been any moment in history. I feel connected to my ancestors. Men and women that although I've never met, I know they saw the same thing that I'm seeing now and I know they too must have a felt a sense of awe while they gazed out over the city of the living, in the middle of the land of the dead. As we pull up to the stables, I look back toward the dunes and the inky sky above. Even now, as I look at the desert calm, the memories are already beginning to fade. Like a dream, the revelations and life changing ideas that had walked across my consciousness only minutes ago are now draining from me and from now until forever will be relegated to my mind's eye. Emerging when least expected, only to fade again like so many fantasies, ideas, dreams and nightmares.

January 2015,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/01/09/stuff-that-endures/,"January 2015, 09",Stuff that endures,"Hi! I'm a white, middle class software developer in London, totally unqualified to offer wisdom or life advice to anyone.

Instead, I'll tell you about something that I've always found interesting: Certain product designs that endure.

Sure, there are simple time-tested designs that will never die -- paper clips, mokka pots, zippers, Bic lighters. I'm intrigued by more complex examples, that develop their own ecosystems, that become icons despite humble roots.

Here's a few I know of. I'm no expert, and have a word limit - apologies if I don't do them justice.

-- Shure SM58: A basic-looking vocal microphone, in a field of fancy specialist devices, that has been in production for almost 50 years. Meant originally for studio recording I think, it's become a go-to workhorse for the live music industry too. Versatile, solid, trustworthy, and pretty cheap. If you've ever seen live music, chances are you've seen one.

There's no magic special feature or technical marvel about it - it's just a good straightforward design, well made.

-- AK-47: (Yeah, guns, I know...meh.) The core design of the AK-47 & derivatives has barely changed in 70 years. They're legendarily robust & reliable. Their endurance is down to the shocking simplicity of the core design. Google it; it's amazing how little there is going on. Parts can be bashed, bent etc and the whole system still functions.

(They're also wildly inaccurate. Source: every video game ever)

-- Toyota Hilux: A pick-up truck family that's popular in the developing world (especially, infamously, in conflict zones) for their near-indestructability. There are probably 40-year-old Hiluxes bouncing happily through harsh offroad conditions all over Africa right now. They're also very customizable and adaptable (most notoriously, into mobile gun platforms :-/ )

I gather Top Gear did a famous set of segments trying – and failing – to break a Hilux. If you can tolerate Jeremy Clarkson, go watch them.

---

And my personal favourite...The Technics SL-1200.

It's a turntable which first came out in the early 1970s. Originally meant as a home hifi turntable, it's definitely not for audiophiles, and was considered middle-of-the-road.

But it gave birth to much of our modern music & culture.

Largely by accident, its technical features (like high-torque direct-drive, good pitch control) along with a few design tweaks in the late 70s (like moving the pitch control to a slider on the top) made this humble home-stereo component a versatile tool for messing around with vinyl in unintended, unexpected ways...

...which, through some pioneers experimenting, gave birth to turntablism: scratching, cutting, sampling, mixing, remixing......which gives us hip-hop.Oh, I wish I had more words to describe just how important that is to shaping our modern cultures.

The SL-1200 (and 1210) inspired and allowed new ways of playing music, blended playing with performing, redefining 'DJ', redefining 'nightclub', shaping the evolution of electronic music, spawning a thousand genres...the wheels of steel literally redefined what we call music.

Even when purpose-built competitors emerged, the SL-1200 endured because of its dependability and consistency. Not bad for a design that barely changed in 30+ years (the digital revolution won, it was discontinued in 2010).

As an icon, It is to hip-hop what the Fender Strat is to Rock.(Or should that be the Gibson Les Paul? Guitar nuts, expand my knowledge :) )

---

Compared to a world of gadgets designed for ""planned obsolescence"", these products' lifespans, impact and resulting icon statuses are pretty inspiring to me.

There are some common themes; robustness and adaptability, skilled engineering where it counts. But the biggest theme that sticks out for me.....Simplicity.

(Some software examples for nerds: unix, vim, http)

Most of my friends are in relationships, either with a spouse, significant other, pillow, or favorite cheese. I have almost always been single, unless you count that time when I was five years old and my Korean friend kissed me in the laundry closet. Honestly, I was at his birthday to eat as much kimchi as I could stand, but he clearly sought out a spicier dish. Now that I am of age, my friends are usually encouraging me to date online or in person, write Hugh Jackman, attend Meetups. Be anything but single. 

My friends decided to buy and set-up my online dating profile. They chose a site where I can propose an activity and then do that with the interested party. My friends insisted on writing my profile and since they paid, a contract followed. You will find one of those dates below.

I write you from a dwindling state of tipsiness and a break from How About We. I pulled a temporary plug on the dating website because I wasn't having much fun seeing the same odd profiles over and over again. Really, you dudes need to make your profile photo a pair of shoes, a banana, or an 85 year young woman? Siphoning through profiles felt stale and I swear I began seeing people from the site while walking around town. After the two month hiatus, I decided I would give it one more go.

Matt listed Muppet Treasure Island as his most watched movie so why not see if he were a muppet or a man? Off to the pool hall we went. Matt shared that he volunteers as a DJ for a local radio station while tending bar at a BBQ joint in my neighborhood. We spoke casually and he did not insist on teaching me how to play pool by grabbing my hand or hip. Already bonus points given my previous experience. I played a measly first game and managed to yell, ""I love not getting balls in holes!"" On any other night, this would have been accompanied by a ""that's what she said"" but I looked down and noticed my left breast hanging out of my bra. 

You see, I wore tight jeans and a decorative white top, but didn't realize that when I was bending over to shoot pool, my left breast kept falling out of my bra. Freeing itself from its cloth cage and creating a third middle breast. Who needs twins when you can have triplets! I was horrified. Every few minutes, I would walk over to the wall, sip some Magners and adjust myself in what I would like to call the nip and tuck. Sink the nine ball. ""Oh, you graduated with a degree in journalism. I studied English down south."" Look down. Nip and tuck. Prematurely sink the eight ball. ""What did you think of Seattle when you visited?"" Look down. Nip and tuck. Note to self, Victoria sucks at keeping a Secret.

Surprisingly, I don't think Matt realized what was going on because he seemed pretty focused on the game. After our third round, we sat down for a minutes to finish our drinks. At this point, I saw Matt blatantly staring at my triplets and I decided to throw on my fleece. We finished our date and before parting ways, he asked me on another. Go figure.

If you want more stories, you can search online for CatholicGelt. Otherwise, I hope to hear from any one of you about embarrassing dates intertwined with comedic self-awareness.

January 2015,07,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/01/07/never-settle-for-hotdogs/,"January 2015, 07",Never Settle for Hotdogs,"Here's my obligatory sentence about being humbled and honored to write to this fine list of subscribers. May I add that I often thought this system was rigged? Many lottery winners seemed intimidatingly poignant and I assumed winners flaked out, forcing the creators to scramble to find excerpts from long-forgotten philosophy textbooks and angsty tumblrs.

Anyway, I now have more faith in the list and am very real and very much from Southern Indiana. My name is Bradley and I want to share with you a sentiment I seem to repeat a lot in my personal and professional life.

My father always enjoyed using analogies when explaining things to me. He always, like the good father he is, prodded me to do bigger and better things. One of my favorite analogies that I tend to share is about dating. When I was in high-school, I always wondered if the girl I was currently dating was ""the one."" I came to my father with this and he immediately asked me if I liked hotdogs. I of course responded that I did and didn't understand how this was pertinent to my question. He then asked me if I liked steak. And, again, I told him I did. He then explained that many people go through life eating and enjoying hotdogs while there is uneaten steak all around us. As cheesy as it sounded, I really began to understand what he was saying and never stopped thinking about it in this manner. I began to second guess every single thing I was doing, hoping it wasn't hotdoggian in nature.

I work as a counselor at Job Corps. For those who aren't familiar, 16-24 year olds from all over the country are given a federally funded scholarship to get their high-school diploma and a trade of some sort. It is very common for 22 year olds to arrive on center with the reading and math ability of a 2nd grader, no concept of money or discipline, and no place to call home. Despite the incredible opportunity, a very large % of students leave the center and go back to living at home, unemployed and uneducated, eating allegorical hotdogs. My job is to beg and plead them not to do so. If they just give the program even 6 months, they could change their lives and future generations' lives. Unfortunately, I lose this argument more than I win it, and I'm a pretty persuasive guy.

I also tend to see my peers marry into loveless relationships. It's what they're used to, what they know. I beg and plead with them to break things off, try some steak! I'm often looked at like some lunatic, because we aren't supposed to tell people to break a loveless relationship, especially when it isn't hurting anybody. As long as there isn't rampant drug activity and physical abuse, we allow our loved ones to commit their lives to soul-sucking monsters. We let our incredibly bright peers stay at a job that is beneath them.

Break up with your awful significant other, go back to school, quit your job, buy a plane ticket, take a risk, and find your steak. As generic as it sounds, this type of mental attitude can change your life and your best friend's.

Please contact me. Tell me your dream, your idea, your issue. I will listen with my comically large ears.

until we find the form that pleases most

and paints a fair reflection.

What I seek in love ain’t love alone;

that is, it’s not enough to love, or to be loved in return,

it is the striving to find a version of me that I’m willing to keep around.

For every person I meet, for every situation I’m in,

there seems to be another kind of “I”,

filling the mould and adapting to this changeable environment.

Nor is it a case of trying to work out WHO I am,

because there just is NO ONE WAY in which I exist.

A multitude of personas, ideologies, desires and aspirations,

all of them webbing a complex weave of existence,

amounting to the sum of all my parts

and becoming “I”.

Instead, it’s about experiencing most every side of this multichotomical state of being,

and deciding which, if any, of these many masks is the most becoming.

I am who I am in the presence of you,

whoever YOU are

or MAY BE when, in the presence of me,

you’ve morphed and warped your skin to suit the colour of this encounter.

So you see, I don't mourn because love is hard to find,

or muster from the twisted roots of crass desire,

but the BLATANT, STARK and NAKED fact that cries a tortured plea

is that you were the only one that made a better me.

In that kind of moments I realise how big my country is - there is a 9722 kilometers distance between us, 8.5h flight, 7h time zones difference. I live in Saint-Petersburg - one of the most beautiful cities ever, my parents live in Vladivostok - also a wonderful and very unique place, close to asian borderland. I am 24 years old russian single girl with a passion to travellings and everything new. To be honest, I didnt have any reasons to move - I bet sometimes you just have feelings like you need to change something. Thats exactly what I had. And I never regret about random things and decisions. Random things - best things. (Btw, you can find some pictures of Russia in my insta - yuushh, I would love to see where do you live aswell!)Thats why lets talk about advertising stuff. Im pretty sure you all experienced that pop-ups things when you browse somewhere in internet for something important. Casino, binary options, datings, games - whatever. Thats what I do for my job. I am a media buyer. The first thing that my friends tell me once I give them a reply about my job is ""Oh my gosh, that was YOU!"", so if you hate me, I understand that :) But I must admit, I really love my job. I work with people from all around the world, its jus like a travel but without moving. If you have any questions regarding it, I will gladly answer.Advertising will stay live as long as at least 1 from 1000, as we say, ""make a conversion"" - register on dating website, install a game, make a deposit in casino. And so is dream. Keep dreaming, and work on making your dreams come true.I will share with you one of my dreams - to visit as many places as its possible. There is no time to stop. While you move, you stay alive.I already got an italian visa, so that will be my next destinaton! Probably I will meet any of you there ;)Bring all the best to 2015 and Happy New Year!

P.S. Happy New Year - ""S Novim Godom"" in russian language. Now you know more about russian than just vodka, dancing bears and cold weather ;)

Leaves bigger than my torso with stems more like branches. They littered the area we had chosen for camp. We had enough firewood to cook dinner on; headlights would have to suffice after that. Iquitos was more than half a day away. We were in the jungle.    Let me make this clear. I love doing crazy shit, but I'm not careless. I truly believe things don't go wrong, just differently than originally planned. Going with the flow, assuming positive intent in people, and trusting the universe has given me some amazing experiences. But sometimes...shit's just crazy.    So, anyway, we're in the Amazon at night, and decide it'd be fun to take out this canoe. At. Night. The water levels were pretty low, and the canoe a bit large for the three of us. Caimans surrounded us with their frog-like croaks. Night monkeys called out nearby.   ""Keep your flashlight low, or the bats will come too close for comfort.""   I think about all vaccines I didn't get as the gossiping mosquitos become a permanent din in my ear. Did I mention how dark it was? Sure, the stars were breathtaking. Whatever. I'd just gotten off a three day cargo ship ride where I saw plenty of stars. Electric eels lived in that water. We kept getting stuck in the muck, using our hands to push off branches, hoping there wasn't a tarantula on them. I sat at the front of the canoe, my headlight guiding us down the narrow path the jungle trees had given us. My hands were shaking when they weren't swatting bugs away from my mouth, eyes, and ears. With only one paddle at our disposal, Alex's exhaustion decided to head back to camp.    Alex and Lindsay were noticeably as excited as I was horrified. Pointing out different critters and shaking the canoe if something begged for a closer look. A few yards away from the dock as we float through lily pads, Alex asks us if we want to see something cool. Of course we do.    ""Turn off your lights.""   Like fairies tucked in for the night, baby fireflies sat in the middle of each pad. Most were yellow and green, but I swear one was red. In that moment, all of the fear left me, and it all became immediately worth every uncomfortable moment.    I go into the new year remembering what it felt like to let go of that fear. To see the beauty and perfection in it. Cuz you know what? It's okay to be scared. But fuck if I'm gonna let it stop me.

January 2015,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/01/03/request-help-on-over-optimization-reward-a-story-from-thailand/,"January 2015, 03",Request: help on over-optimization. Reward: a story from Thailand,"Hey Listserve,

I'm Mark Bao. I'd like to ask for some life advice. And tell you a story.

1. For most of my life, I've been trying to optimize things as much as possible. Optimize the things I'm working on. Make sure that I'm learning exactly the right things, to build the mental structures so I can be different than others. And above all -- make sure I'm working on something that I think will have the most impact on the world -- which right now I think is behavioral science. But lately, such a focus on optimization, and perfectionism, has gotten difficult -- in part because I realize that there's so much uncertainty and I can't predict things, and trying to make sure things work out while not knowing everything has been overwhelming. Has anyone else dealt with this? I'd love to chat with you.

2. I'm starting a group of people who are interested in psychology, thoughtful topics, life-long learning, and understanding things on a deeper level. If you read Farnam Street or Raptitude or Less Wrong or are interested in understanding behavior and improving personal growth, it would be rad to have you in the group! Just shoot me an email. The goal is to have a collaborative discussion among thoughtful people trying to make the world a better place.

And now a story. Northwest Thailand. During my round-the-world trip. T and I decide to take a day hike into a valley, between two mountains, to a waterfall, crossing a river a few times, climbing boulders, walking through idyllic paths through damp forests and brushes teeming with weird bugs we've never seen before.

We get to the waterfall, and eat our sandwiches in victory. 3 hours to sundown - just enough time to get back home before things go dark. But when it does go dark... It gets below zero. If you stayed in the valley, things aren't looking great for you. We had no more food. No water. Hiking in shorts and a t-shirt. No worries, plenty of time to go.

Walking back, T spots an upper trail. I'm thrilled -- I hate backtracking and always like to take new trials. We walk up and see a whole new view of the valley, almost reaching the top of the mountain. But...

""Hey, T?""

""Yeah?""

""Did we lose the trail?""

We look down. What was the trail now was a few leaves on the ground.

""Uh, weird.""

1.5 hours to go before sundown. We tried backtracking, trying to find the leaves on the ground we followed before. It was all shrubs and trees and weird bugs.

Nothing.

1 hour to get out. No trail. Getting dark. No food. No water. And already feeling chilly.

Panic. But after a moment: we remembered we crossed the river at the bottom of the valley. So we thought: well, maybe we should try to get down to the river.

We found a relatively flat incline with some leaves, got on our butts, and slid down the side, getting scratched, bit by bugs, dodging tree trunks, and trying to control ourselves going down.

We didn't know if that would lead to the right place. We didn't know how far we went up and if we had enough time to get down.

But then we caught a glimpse of the river. We got up, jumped over a bunch of boulders, and ran over to the river, ridiculously happy that we made it down. Followed the river for a while, found the path again -- and found our way back, walking back home just as the sun set.

January 2015,02,https://thelistservearchive.com//2015/01/02/hello/,"January 2015, 02",hello!,"Hello! 

I am so very shocked and excited to be writing this Listserve email today, am honored to introduce myself to so many different people. 

My name is Zoe, and I am a 22 year old student from Texas. I also have no idea what to write about in this email. When asking around, my friends gave me some very scattered and varied advice, so I hope you all do not mind a very scattered and varied essay. 

I do not know what career I would like to have. I am currently torn between teaching inner city kids (research Teach for America - their mission statement is wonderful) or to become a social worker and help kids in the foster care system. Kids with issues are my passion, and I am very worried that I will not be a very good worker no matter what my profession is. 

I am currently a waitress, and I suppose the most interesting things that have happened to me while working is multiple people asking me for lap dances (I work at a steakhouse), I have been told that I look like ""the suicide type"" (to this day I am still confused and concerned), and one elderly couple has slapped my hand when I tried to refill their drinks. When that same old couple later asked me to take a picture of their 65th anniversary dinner with their old Kodak camera, I did so, but covered the lense with my middle finger (I am still quite ashamed of my temper). 

My favorite books are A Tree Grows in Brokklyn, Lonesome Dove, The Dollmaker, anything by Steinbeck, Don Quixote, and The Three Musketeers. I am also a huge fan of Pablo Neruda's poetry, and am obsessed with short stories. 

As you can probably tell, I love people; I find them enchanting and endearing, with so much wisdom and love to be shared. If you are interested, I would love to read about your lives! Please feel free to email me stories about your lives, or any advice you might give to a young person struggling to live in this chaotic world, or anything that you might have on your mind. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read emails from Listserve; I respect you all so much for doing that. I hope you all have a lovely new year!

Who exactly is it working for, again? You evaluate me based on where I grew up, where I went to school, where I’ve worked, where I’m working, where I’m living, where I’m moving (or why I’m not moving), what I “want to do with my life,” what I look like on Instagram, what I sound like on Twitter, what I’m listening to on Spotify, who I’m dating (if I’m dating—am I datable?), what I’m eating, drinking, reading, driving, saying, not saying and, goddammit, it’s just too much. And you want it all to look effortless! Heaven forbid I look like I’m trying. You want me on the edge and playing it safe—living like money’s no object and saving like it’s the only object. You want me sensitive and untouchable, hilarious and dead serious, hopeful and cynical, put together and chicly untethered, well-adjusted and restless. And I just can’t cut it. It’s kind of ironic. You’ve started to look a lot more like “God” than you used to. The primary difference is that you’ve got a whole lot more unwritten rules to play by and, let’s be honest, a whole lot less promise. As a result, you are now dead to me, World. And to make this eminently clear to you, I reject your supreme commandment: that I must be myself. I reject this precisely because that is how you keep me climbing your ladder. I’m done climbing.

December 2014,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/12/29/life-list/,"December 2014, 29",Life List,"“The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.” -Eleanor Roosevelt

Many of you are probably familiar with the concept of a ""bucket list,"" a tally of all the things that you want to do and be and see before you die. In the hope that my dance with the bucket is a long way off, I've more optimistically dubbed mine a ""life list."" I've been keeping it since I was 15, with the goal of mesmerizing my future grandchildren with crazy tales of my bizarre and eventful life. Every time the road seems too narrow or my life feels circumscribed, I push all my energy towards achieving one of the items on the list. This year, I checked off ""hug a panda,"" ""learn to saber open a bottle of Champagne,"" and ""eat ramen in Tokyo,"" not to mention some unintentional additions, like ""get paid to write 50 trivia questions about Gilmore Girls"" and ""get made fun of by Brian Boitano.""

My life list, like life itself, will never be completed, and that's OK. If anything, it gets longer every year, and every item checked off seems to grow three new ones, hydra-like, in its place. Some of the items are genuine life skills, some are idle fantasies, and probably far too many of them involve drinking the most delicious drinks possible. But though it may be silly, the list reminds me that the world is open, that some dreams can be small and attainable, that if you don't ask, you don't get. For a little insight into my (admittedly odd) brain, here are 15 items that I'm working on right now. If you think you can help me get closer to achieving any of them, I'd be so grateful.

- Learn to caramelize onions perfectly, every time- Go to a Japanese baseball game, and know all the coordinated cheers- Build a fire without matches or a lighter- Get a kiss from Jon Hamm (I know he's taken—on the cheek is fine)- Sew myself a dress I'm proud to wear in public- Write an article for The New York Times- Wear a Ghostbusters suit with Caitlin Moran- Help a bright, underprivileged kid apply and get into a top college, and counsel and support them through graduation day (and beyond!)- Drink Orval Vert at L'Ange Gardien in Belgium- Get my Certified Cicerone (I'm already a Certified Beer Server, so I'm halfway there)- Sit in the cockpit of a plane with the pilot(s)- Go to the Vanity Fair Oscar party- Be awarded a bottle of Cristal so big that I can't lift it (badass 94-year-old restaurateur Cecilia Chiang inspired this one)- Give $5,000 to the Fistula Foundation

I'm especially hoping you can help me with that last one. An obstetric fistula is an injury sustained in childbirth that renders a woman incontinent. It's easily fixed with surgery, but women in developing countries who go without treatment can suffer for their entire lives, becoming ostracized from their families, communities, and even their own children because they're perceived as smelly or ""unclean."" It's estimated that ongoing problems relating to fistula affect over a million women worldwide. By funding this surgery and training medical professionals in 21 countries, the Fistula Foundation often quite literally gives women their lives back. (For those who like to know where their money is going, CharityNavigator has detailed stats, and has given the Foundation four stars, their highest rating, for the past decade.)

If one-fifth of the Listserve donates just $1, $5,000 should be a piece of cake. I'll get us 1/25th of the way there today with a $200 donation of my own. I would be so grateful if you would consider giving $1 (or more!) to the Fistula Foundation. It takes less than 60 seconds, and you'll have an immeasurable impact on a woman's life.

And if your life list involves anything having to do with food writing, San Francisco, reading more novels, or drinking craft beer, please do reach out. I'm hoping to help other Listservers check off at least 15 items (and hopefully a lot more!) from their own life lists.

Thank you to the Listserve team for this opportunity, and to my beautiful sister, Mackenzie, for always inspiring me to do and be better. I am an incredibly fortunate person, and this experience is a great reminder to approach each day with a little more gratitude for all the abundance I have.

I’m your host Brian Agler, and we’ve got a fantastic show for you today.

What’s happening...

President Obama recently announced that he would begin normalizing relations with Cuba. Analysts say the move will strengthen the airline and hotel industry, but cripple the rickety, old raft industry.

What else, what else…

North Korea has proposed a joint investigation with the United States over the recent Sony hack. The investigation is off to a slow start, as every North Korean lead consists of investigators saying, “Hey, look over there!” and then promptly running in the other direction.

Speaking of cyber attacks…

Staples recently announced that personal data from over 1.2 million shoppers has been stolen. Staples responded saying, “We never saw this coming...mainly because we couldn’t believe 1.2 million people did their last minute Christmas shopping at an office supply store.

Oh, this is great…

Former Florida governor Jeb Bush announced he was forming an exploratory committee to run for president. His platform is all about fiscal responsibility: Cutting taxes, scaling back government spending, and saving money by reusing old “President Bush” stationery that’s been cluttering up the Oval Office.

And finally, here’s something...

Sir Elton John married his longtime partner David Furnish on Saturday. They were pronounced man and Rocket Man.

We’ve got some great guests today, from Mad Men, and the Black Mirror Christmas special, Jon Hamm is here!

He’s an amazing stand-up, and you can catch him every week on Ground Floor, Rory Scovel is here!

And all the way from Brooklyn to play a song off their album, Maia Manu, Bird Courage is here!

That’s The Monologue. We’ve got a great show for you today. Check your inboxes, we’ll be right back.

###

In my spare time, I’m a comedy writer, and for while now I’ve had the idea to start a late-night monologue mailing list. If anything, it would be a great writing exercise.It would also give me a chance to help spread the word about some actors/comedians/musicians I like.

I can’t send any links through the listserve, but I urge you to check out:

Black Mirror (We all know Jon Hamm, of course he’s great)Rory Scovel (I think he’s the funniest, most creative, stand-up working today)Bird Courage (I saw them playing on a subway platform once and they just knocked me out)

Yes, it's spelled that way on purpose, and no, we don't use the character masks anymore.

The troupe has existed for over twenty years, located in Mobile, Alabama, though we'll travel just about anywhere there's a venue.  We perform in an extemporaneous style that starts with a basic script, but each actor adds his or her own touches to the character and story as it develops.  No two performances are the same.

We don't make any money. 

Our proceeds go to charities.  Our previous show (Here Wolf, There Wolf, Everywhere a Werewolf) benefitted the Animal Rescue Foundation of Mobile.

We do make everything else.

We take great pride in building our own costumes, finding or fashioning our own props, reusing or reimagining whatever is available.  We've made beards out of tea leaves, a sarcophagus out of wrapping paper, and a crocodile out of soda bottles. Almost all of our shows are original pieces written by our director, who often gives us a handful of script pages to study while she finishes writing the rest.

And everyone who joins is welcomed like family.

We have all types of people, young and old, in the troupe.  Some people join for a single show, while others stay for years.  For me, the members of Commedia del Arte have become some of my closest friends.  At one point, I drove 6 hours every other weekend to continue attending rehearsal.  I was Wendy in our production of Peter Pan! No distance would have kept me away.

A week ago today, I got married.  (I'm actually on my honeymoon as I write this.) Commedia del Arte was as important a part of my wedding as any family could be.  They wrote and performed an original wedding play for my groom and me, a beautiful wedding gift and a true display of friendship and love.

Please look us up to learn more! Find us through Google or through our Facebook (Commedia del Arte of Mobile). Here you'll find more information and--best of all--hundreds of pictures of our characters and shows.

Thanks and all the best,

December 2014,26,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/12/26/being-an-earthling/,"December 2014, 26",Being an Earthling,"Hello Listservers everywhere!

Firstly, thanks to Listserve HQ friends for the chance to say something to the global community.  Even if it's random choice, it's still an honour to be given the opportunity to write, as well as to read.

For my moment of your time, I'd like to remind you of the first-ever photo, taken from the Moon in 1969, of planet Earth.  What an extraordinary thing that was to see - the view of the home of Earthlings that our neighbours would have, if there were such creatures.  Suddenly the whole, huge, complex, busy and taken-for-granted thing you and I live on and rarely think about, probably, was seen hanging unsupported in dark empty space, looking delicate, fragile even - just a small blue-green empty-looking ball, where in fact all life as we know it started, and still exists.

Being an Earthling is an interesting idea, I believe.  You and I are members of a single human race, and seeing Earth as one entity in that photo - a single atom in a vast, endless universe - suggests that there's much more to link us than to separate us.  I often wonder why we have borders, then; boundaries, frontiers, even countries?  All that naming the bits of the planet we each inhabit does seems more about separating us than seeing how much we have in common.  

Yet isn't it great the way that the Listserve breaks those barriers down?  I could be young, old, any race, gender, colour, creed, rich or poor - but I'm still exactly the same as you - an Earthling.  And seriously, if I have to have a passport, I'd much rather it said Earthling that the name of some country.  Why shouldn't it?  Think of how much the world could change for the better, if the human race shared just one common name: Earthling.  After all, pretty well every Earthling wants the same stuff: home, safety, enough to eat, someone to love, a healthy life, a job, good friends, family.

Maybe if we ditched the competition to be ""better than"" or ""feel superior to"" our neighbours, we could focus on what the real Earth issues are that you and I face - problems of fairness, justice, drinking water, food, rampant capitalism, poverty, finite resources, global pollution, climate change - if you live on Earth you can't ignore these, given that you live on the same planet, breathe the same air, as every other human.  Remember: Earth isn't doomed, but Earthlings might be.  We're perilously close to being as dead as the dinosaurs - the human race gone - if we don't cooperate globally.  

I'm a 62 year old with a great life and am a lucky member of the privileged west.  Most Listservers seem to average 25 or so and are rightly focused on their futures.  I wish you well in yours; I also hope and trust you pay more attention to the ground under your feet than my generation has.  When the oil, the bees, the rivers, the minerals and the crops have all gone - where and how will you live? Your children? It's their planet too - so be clever and be brave: you can help solve Earth's problems, otherwise you and I are doomed.  

If there is any hope for the future of humankind, and the planet it stands on, it lies in the hands, hearts and minds of Earthlings - particularly the young, who are the Earth's future - and their own.  To end optimistically - you're smart, and I trust you'll play your part.

December 2014,25,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/12/25/enjoy/,"December 2014, 25",Enjoy!,"Timing, they say, is all. The Listserve ‘winners’ email awaited my arrival home from a visit to my younger brother in hospital (a double heart bypass, complicated by diabetes). My older brother has Alzheimer’s, and has just been sent home to die. I’m trying to complete the sale of my house but the buyers, a Christian church organisation, are anything but compassionate in their dealings and turning the dream into a nightmare. So, I was feeling rather despondent.

Then I’m chosen to write to thousands of strangers. What a gift, what an opportunity, what a spirit raiser!

Your time’s precious, so I’ll introduce myself and then ask a question.

I was born in a neighbour’s bed, following my father’s death and my mother’s eviction from our home connected to his job. The attending midwife, convinced I’d be born dead, abandoned my mother for ‘a woman up the road whose kid has a chance of being alive, love.’ Later, after a remarriage, our new family ended up living in an old railway carriage, perched on its wheels, in a field on the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea. A magical childhood followed: walking the beach to school, using sea and sand as our playground, standing on the headland watching thunderstorms develop over the waters.

Those who educate us, influence our life choices and should be respected and valued. One teacher was irascible, rigid and easily mocked. But for his negative attitude, I’d have been an architect. Another was bright, attractive, sexy and encouraging: through her I became a storyteller.

Enough of me: for more, type my author name ‘Stuart Aken’ into any search engine. Feel free to connect with me. I love the facility of the web and the net to link complete strangers from all over this amazing planet we inhabit.

So, to my question, which is complex: If you believe in a God (and there are many), is this because you were brought up to do so, because you consider every word of some text to be from that deity, because you ‘feel’ such a belief to be right, or because you have a deep-seated need of such a power?If you don’t believe in any form of deity, is that due to upbringing, consideration of the evidence, or straightforward cynicism?To be fair to you, I’ll express my own view. I suspect that we will never truly know whether or not a God exists. Such a power, by its very nature, must be so far beyond our ability to comprehend as to be inaccessible. I’ve therefore come to the conclusion that the only way to live is to abide by the Golden Rule and to live our lives in a way that will leave the world a better place than when we entered it.

I hope that this short missive finds you at the festive season and that you enjoy the holiday and engage in its spiritual message of peace and goodwill to all.

You can respond to me, should you wish, at the email address below or through the social media I inhabit.

Thank you for your time and attention. And enjoy!

December 2014,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/12/24/meditation/,"December 2014, 24",Meditation,"Hello everyone on The Listserve!

I want to talk about something that I started in my life that is really helping me out to go through a bad moment. That is meditation.

Meditation is a simple activity that you can make almost anywhere and it doesn't cost you a penny. All you have to do is to spare some time for meditating. I am really a beginner but I could feel the benefits of meditating already.

Turn off your phone and start doing that when you will have no interruption, if needed warn people around so they don't disturb. All you have to to is to sit down, comfortably. Keep your spine aligned and focus on your breathe. A few mantras could help you to calm down. Three long Oooooooooooommmmms would do the job.

The thing is focus on your breathe or in the gaps between the thoughts. Meditation is all about trying not to think about anything, but when we are starting, lots of thoughts will surely come. All you have to do is observe those thoughs. Try not to judge and avoid to ""follow"" a thought or dialogue with it.

Imagine the thoughts are like clouds on a blue sky, your goal is to focus on the blue sky.

The thoughs are very important actually, cause they give you really good hints about your condition. All you do is observe. Ok, I thought of it, I thought of that, that made anxious... this is looking at you, and this is important. I call it honest observation.

But remember that the whole practice is to learn how to not follow the clouds, focus on the blue sky. Once you notice that you followed a thought and you are in the middle of a dialogue with it, don't get angry, simply abandon that thought and start focusing again on your breathe.

I understand that the goal of yoga and meditation is to ""be really present"" and that means to be totally aware of our presence, our self, the others, in everything we do, in every moment.

One last thing I have discovered as a beginner in meditation is: Your mind is just a part of your conscience. Your mind is not your whole conscience, your mind is not you.

There's a video that gives real great information, and detailed instructions about how to meditate. It was created by the Indian government to explain to the americans what was meditation. Search youtube for:  ""The Secret Meditation in Hindi""

Cheers!

I finished university in 2012 and migrated to the big smoke, following every other graduate, or so it seemed. I've been lucky enough to surround myself with brilliant and inspiring people at a marketing agency in central London, only now am I getting slightly itchy feet thinking I need to go and make something of myself, in a place outside of here.

London is mad, fast paced and full of incredible little places but I often feel like the adventurous side of me gets sucked up whilst living here. It's so easy to stick in a job I'm so comfortable with, but not doing something I truly love and am passionate about. I'm desperate to travel the world working for an NGO, and completely take me out of my comfort zone. Going to Kenya as a volunteer in 2009, has undoubtedly been the best decision I've ever made - I urge you, implore you even, to jump at any opportunity to go there. The people are just wonderful, and it will get under your skin in the way it has done mine.

So here's hoping that during 2015 I can cross of some of the list below. If any of you thousands of people all around the world find yourselves in London, get in touch! It's a big old world out there.

December 2014,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/12/22/about-strangers/,"December 2014, 22",About strangers,"Hello, strangers!

My name is Yasmim and I’m passionate about traveling. I'm 21 years old and I am proud to say that I already visited 11 countries. My last trip was in august/2013, when I traveled across Europe all by myself. My next stop will be: California and Vegas! yay!

One of the most important things that travelling has taught me is: there are much more good people than bad people in the world. My experience as a lonely traveler shown me that there are much more people willing to help a stranger than you could imagine. Strangers in train stations helped me to carry my luggages; strangers gave me all kind of information that I needed and made my traveling a lot more easier; among several others things. Those strangers helped me without asking for anything in return (except for some beggars in Rome, but that's another story).

In 2012 I was in Lousiana on a job exchange program (I worked in a Wendy's but that's also another story, haha). My friends and I were dying to go to New Orleans to see the Mardi Gras parade (and, of course, the party). However, we didn't have a car and couldn't rent one because of our age... So we decided to ask for a ride on the road. Ok, I know that was a little bit risky (maybe a lot). Anyway, a stranger took us safely to New Orleans and gave us a lot of city tips.

All of my traveling experiences were positives and I do not believe that was a question of luck. Of course, THERE ARE bad people in the world, so you must be careful! But, sometimes, just trust. Like in that Coca-cola advertising: there are reasons to believe! The world still is an horrible place but I guarantee you that’s not as evil as the media show us. Sometimes I have the feeling that we live in a permanent paranoia about safety! Of course we must have some precautions, but we can't stop living because of fear.

So, that’s my advice for you, strangers: put some faith in humanity and don't be afraid of trusting :)

p.s.: do you live in California/Vegas and have any travel tips? Please, email me!p.s. 2: do you live anywhere in the world and have any travel tips? Please, email me!p.s. 3: not exactly related, but If you read portuguese, I truly recommend you to read ""Vacaciones"" by Ana Paula Barbi.p.s. 4: I'm a Listserve member since 2012 so it was REALLY hard to write anything, since I've read a lot of amazing stuff and I couldn't stop thinking that what I had to say wasn't good enough. I spent those 48 hours suffering from anxiety.p.s. 5: I really don't know how to use comma in english.p.s. 6: Like ""Humans of New York"" on Facebook. You won't regret it.p.s. 7: I know those ""life advices"" are kind of boring, but I really wanna write about this. Haha.p.s. 8: ""Beijinho no ombro pro recalque passar longe.""

Many things where suggested to me; how to create a magickal life, my experiences as an apprentice to various people, life experiences,  my passion for my spirituality and many others.  

Then it hit me, appreciation and courage.  My mom and I will always be at odds, we will never truly see eye-to-eye but I appreciate her more then I could ever explain. She went to bat for me many times as a teen, she has pushed my buttons more then she knows, she is there for me and my children pretty much every time I need her and she has complete trust  that she can take whatever life gives her.

As a teen I was always angry with her and now I admire her strength and courage. So mom, thank you.

Dad, I haven't forgotten about you. You're generosity is as deep as the stories I've heard. You're advice always appreciated even though I may not use it, I still keep it around. 

I'm thankful for all your hard work and dedication to family and some of my favorite memories will always be of you letting me help fix the cars and finish the basement, as frustrating as it might of been for you.

Listserve recipients, find your courage and be appreciative. Much love and hope to you all.

December 2014,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/12/19/on-community-organizing-and-the-internet/,"December 2014, 19","On Community, Organizing and the Internet","About 10 years ago a bunch of people who worked on the Internet team of John Kerry’s US presidential campaign got together after the election. It was the first time digital technology played a major role in a campaign and they knew it was the future of politics.

They also knew there was a long road ahead. They founded a scrappy organization, the New Organizing Institute, to define, train and recruit new organizers who could continue to expand and innovate. In 2006, NOI held a small unconference, Rootscamp, to spread the word.

This weekend in Washington, DC that conference is happening again. It’s grown from a gathering that filled a couple of classrooms at a community college in Brooklyn to a weekend that brings together more than a thousand progressive organizers from across the US and the world.

But it’s more than the size of the event that has changed.

I’ve worked in this space all that time. When I began, just after the 2004 elections, it was in its infancy. Few people understood what we did or why we did it. Most people thought if you worked on the Internet team you would fix their computer. We regularly heard people say they “didn’t do the Internet.”

Yet, we knew what it would be. We knew the power of the Internet had the ability to influence every single aspect of the campaigns we worked on. We know it was a tool for change. A way to bring people together. To find common ground. To build power. To make the world a better place.

We also knew we couldn’t do it alone. We needed allies. We needed more of us. We needed the powers-that-be who controlled the budgets and everything else to give a damn and pay attention.

Rootscamp was where we came to figure out how to make that happen.

Yesterday I walked the halls of the Rootscamp2014 that buzzed with energy. There were happy reunions. The opportunity to run into a colleague you worked alongside years back and hadn’t seen lately. Hugs from friends whose lives had taken them away from DC. But most striking was I saw more faces I didn’t recognize than those that I did. I was struck by how far we’d come. How the community we had hoped to create had become a reality. How that collective work had blossomed into a community that was beautifully diverse and inclusive.

It’s given careers to people who had passion and purpose. It’s been a launching pad for companies, nonprofits and campaigns and individuals that work to elect our representatives from school board to president, stop climate change, end gun violence, increase women’s equality, give a voice to the voiceless, and much more. It’s where we want to solve big problems and answer hard questions. It’s a place where we know we are more powerful when we do that together.

Of course, we still have work to do. We continue to strive for more. But we have a place where that happens – a community where we learn from each other and challenge ourselves to be and do better.

If you’ve ever wondered about doing this type of work. if you’ve wanted a way in, I encourage you to google the New Organizing Institute. You could be walking the halls next year alongside us, full of energy and empowered to create change. That would be a beautiful thing.

I’d love to hear how you’ve created a community of your own, challenged the status quo, or followed your bliss.

With gratitude for this community too,

She smiled and exclaimed, “I was ready to welcome you to the United States of America!” I literally LOL-ed! She was the most pleasant soul I’ve ever met...she just had never seen nor met a person with a turban before. Not racist…but maybe a little ignorant. But that’s OK, I am willing to educate and people are willing to learn. That’s what it’s all about.In case you haven’t figured it out yet, I am medical student in California currently enjoying living in Monterey Bay while learning medicine at a community hospital in a nearby city that serves mostly migrant workers. I am at a juncture in my life where I have to decide what field of medicine to enter that will subsequently dictate what my life will look like for the rest of my life. Will I be a surgeon and cut people open and live at the hospital? Will I be a community health doc in a small town that everyone knows on a first name basis? Will I be a radiologist and live in a dark room looking at screens all day and be content with minimal human contact? Will I have to move to another part of the country for my training for anywhere from 3-7 years? Will I come out of medical school with the same drive for community organizing and engagement that I came in with?

I met an amazing woman earlier this year…and I want to spend every moment with her, helping her accomplish her dreams to change the world, and I know she will help me do the same. Her training will also take at least another 5 years as well. What are the chances they will be in the same place?

December 2014,15,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/12/15/all-lives-matter/,"December 2014, 15",All Lives Matter,"Dear Reader,

Black lives matter. These three little words, which are so obviously true, echo the great pain of too many. Parents that lost their beautiful children, brothers and sisters that never get too play together, loved ones brutally ripped apart, little children that will grow up without  one of their parents, and so many more.  I can imagine the pain. And I hand my head in shame. Because justice is denied to too many families. The least we could do is stop those responsible and hold them accountable. Yet even this seems to be too much. With the great majority of cases ignored and the whispers for justice unheard. What do we tell the family of Tamir Rice, Eric Garner and Mike Brown ?

The callous disrespect for human life does not end there. Blackwater's Youngest Victim is one of the most heartbreaking documentaries that I ever saw. It tells the story of  Ali Kinani's death. Ali was a nine-year old boy. He was killed by Blackwater forces in the infamous Nisour Square massacre. They were in no danger and opened fire on innocent by-standers for no apparent reason. Sadly very few people know about this and many other tragedies in the Iraq war.  Cheerleading a war is never hard if you do not face the high price paid.

An other great documentary Dirty Wars starts with the story of The Khataba raid an incident in the War in Afghanistan in which five civilians, including two pregnant women and a teenage girl, were killed by U.S. forces on February 12, 2010. Initially, it was implied that the three women were killed prior to the raid by family members in an honor killing. As part of the cover-up US Special Forces removed bullets from the victims bodies.

In relation to War on Terror, I would like to thank Craig Murray Former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan. He exposed the complicity of the UK-government in torture programs. Which in Uzbekistan includes boiling people alive. No Western leader seem to have a particular problem with this as long as Uzbekistan remains an ally.  ""The British government  does not care how many people they kill abroad as long as it advances them one bit "" -Craig Murray

Now thanks to a Listserve member's excellent advice to ""Do something new! Do not just tell me to love everybody"", I will not tell you what to do. But I will ask you all, to please remember all the innocent victims. Sadly I have no solutions or answers, only the believe that if we come together. Say enough is enough. Say Every live matters.  Something will change. Ultimately it is in your hands, do you quietly accept the injustice ?

""I have seen that it is not man who is impotent in the struggle against evil, but the power of evil that is impotent in the struggle against man. The powerlessness of kindness, of senseless kindness, is the secret of its immortality. It can never by conquered. The more stupid, the more senseless, the more helpless it may seem, the vaster it is. Evil is impotent before it. The prophets, religious teachers, reformers, social and political leaders are impotent before it. This dumb, blind love is man's meaning. Human history is not the battle of good struggling to overcome evil. It is a battle fought by a great evil, struggling to crush a small kernel of human kindness. But if what is human in human beings has not been destroyed even now, then evil will never conquer.""― Vasily Grossman, Life and Fate

December 2014,14,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/12/14/imagine/,"December 2014, 14",Imagine...,"One of my goals in life is to be open-minded and accepting, which can be incredibly hard, but I always try to hear people out. Even if I don’t end up agreeing with them, I usually learn something. Please hear me out.

Remember a time when you were really for or really against something, and someone you heard, or something you read managed to change your mind. An issue about which you had made up your mind, knew how you felt, could argue about forever. If this has never happened to you, I hope it will at some point. It’s a pretty cool experience. For now, try to imagine how or why it could happen.

…got it?

OK, now I’m going to bring up something that many of you probably feel strongly about, and I want to bring up one part of the issue that isn’t often discussed.

Enter: genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) organisms. What you get when you take a gene from one organism and put it into another organism. Sometimes these two organisms are distantly related, and sometimes they’re very closely related.I just want to make one point: not all GMOs are the same.

The thing that ties them together is pretty obvious, namely, that they are genetically modified. If you are against the process of genetic modification, if you fall on the “tinkering with nature is wrong,” side of the fence, then this one common point is very important to you. There’s plenty of writing out there on this part of the issue, so let’s move on.

What makes individual GMOs different from one another is the gene that’s added to the organism. I also think it’s important what the purpose for adding this gene is, who’s doing it, and how and to whom it will be sold or donated. I think the good/bad of a GMO is dependent on these factors, not just the fact that it is a GMO. In light of this fact, it’s frustrating that the national conversation involves grouping all GMOs together and ignoring the differences between what gene has been added to the organism, what it does, and what it’s for. If someone adds a gene to a crop that makes it poisonous to humans or other animals, that could obviously be bad. If someone adds a gene that makes a crop extra nutritious, that could be great. I think this is the nuance we should focus on.

So, my point here is: if you are against herbicide-resistant crops, you don’t have to be against all GMOs. If you’re against all GMOs Monsanto produces, you don’t have to be against all GMOs, because other companies, and also nonprofits and universities, can produce GMOs. If you’re against all patented GMOs, you don’t have to be against all GMOs, because GMOs can be unpatented and donated rather than sold.

There is endless potential for different uses of GMOs, and we’ve seen only a fraction of it so far. I like to think of a possible best-case-type scenario to illustrate this: a nonprofit uses donated funding to develop a GMO crop that solves a major problem; the nonprofit works with the community affected by said problem to tailor the GMO to their needs, then donates the seed for the crop. We don’t hear about many examples like this. But we could. This is why I care and why I chose this subject to share with you all. The widespread, blanket rejection of all GMOs makes innovation difficult. Let’s talk instead about how we can make them better.

This is very easy, just follow this recipe:The lava cake recipe: (for 15-20 cupcake sized lava cakes)200g butter200g dark cooking chocolate200g white sugar5 eggs1 tbs flourNutella

Preheat the oven at 375 F (190 C). (This is IMPORTANT! Never neglect to preheat the oven.)

Melt the chocolate with the butter, and then add the sugar.Add the eggs one by one, and beat the mixture very strongly after each egg addition. The resulting mixture must be perfectly homogeneous. Add the flour last. (Taste it: it should already taste amaaaaazing!)

Pour the mixture in the cupcake cups; fill them up to 3/4.

Now it's time to add the Nutella, to transform this great recipe in an AMAZING Nutella melting heart cake!I usually take two table spoons; I fill one with roughly 1/3 of Nutella and use the second to drop the Nutella in the center of the cake. Once the Nutella drop is in the cake I use one spoon to collect some dough on the side to lightly cover the Nutella drop with some dough.

Now it's time to cook it 20 to 25 minutes at 375 F (190 C).How to know when it's done: First of all it smells delicious. Secondly you can use a knife and stick it on the SIDE (NOT in the MIDDLE) of the cake, it should come out ALMOST dry (yes, the “almost” is very important: if it's too dry that means it's too cooked, but if it's not enough that means it's not done yet). If that can help you feel better: you will most likely fail the cooking the first time. I did failed it a couple time before getting used to how the cake should look like when it's done.

And now enjoy your delicious cakes, and share them! Good cakes are made to be shared!

(Sure this recipe won’t buy you love for life, but it will do so for the next five minutes, so better act quick if you have a favor to ask, or a bad news to announce.)

I will finish this email with a bunch of random thoughts:-My name is Aleth, I am a 24 years old girl (I know: so not obvious from the name), I am French and I moved to Boston in August to pursue a PhD in Chemistry.-This is the first time in my life I’ve ever, ever, EVER win anything. Hopefully this is announcing the beginning of good times to come.-If you ever want to watch a good French TV show because you like French or you want to learn it, watch Spiral (French title is “Engrenages”). Season 4 is available on Netflix, and there’s plenty of ways to find the previous seasons (why the hell are they not on Netflix too?! That’s an amazing show!)-I considered going all cheesy about the persons I love, but I figured you guys don’t care.-I am also always looking for good new fantasy books, and indie bands. So I’ll be happy to hear any suggestions. (Like literally “any”. I listen to a lot of different styles of music)-Let me know how the recipe turned out if you try it. Or shoot me an email if you want to talk about anything else, I always like a good story.-I’ll finish with a joke I actually find very accurate:What do you call somebody who can speak 3 languages?Trilingual2 languages?Bilingual1 language?...American…!

I was in my first year of college, and I saw people flooding my younger cousin’s Facebook page with their sympathies and promises of prayer.  I couldn’t figure out what happened, so I texted my mom.

She called back because my 16-year-old cousin Anna had been diagnosed with cancer, and you don’t simply text that to someone.

My faith became wrapped up in my cousin’s battle with cancer.  It sounds selfish now to think about how much her battle and her pain became entwined with my own faith journey, but it did. When my mom called back six months later to say that Anna was cancer free, I knew God was present in that miracle.

When Mom called back three months after that to say the cancer had returned, I felt myself starting to doubt a little more.  But God had done it before, so he would do it again.  And by now, 1,000,000 people had pledged to pray for Anna, so if God was out there he had surely received the message.

And then Dad sat across from me at a kitchen table and said, “Mom called today to say Anna has passed away.”  As my first real experience with grief crashed over me, I watched the Santa Claus God I had constructed disintegrate before my eyes.  As I yelled at God and fought with him, then decided we simply weren’t on speaking terms, then finally admitted I don’t know if God’s even out there, I found myself drawing strength from a place that had initially challenged my faith: a historical understanding of Jesus, one that sets aside the debate of his divinity to focus on how he helped others.

I became captivated by the idea of radical love.  I saw radical love manifested in Jesus, because that is my upbringing and my heritage, not because Jesus or Christianity has some exclusive hold over those qualities.  Soon that radical love became translated to justice – Jesus reached out to the people marginalized by society.  When I attended a new church convinced that my doubts and my on-again, off-again belief in God were flashing in neon lights above my head, I heard the pastors call Jesus the first social justice worker, and everything clicked.  I didn’t need to check off items from “the list of things you must believe” to be a Christian – I needed to make the world a better place in whatever small ways I could.

Now I study how people talk about social justice.  I’m fascinated by this concept and how people not only come to understand it, but how they choose to act on it.  And I’m really curious to know what you think, too, because when else can I ask approximately 25,000 people about their thoughts on social justice?

These are my questions to you:When did you first hear about social justice?What does social justice mean to you?What is something you do to make the world a better place?

This is my challenge to you:When people prayed for Anna, they tried to pray at 12:12, based on the corresponding verse in Romans.  Now December 12th has become a special day in the life of the 1Million4Anna Foundation created to honor Anna’s beautiful spirit.  So in memory of Anna and all of the inspiring warriors who have brightened our worlds, I would challenge you to brighten a child’s day on December 12th.  Together we will make the world a better place.

Float on, Anna.

We all have that one night/day in our lives which makes us think we learnt something new about ourselves. This is one of those nights which made me more acceptable towards life and how it's up to you to make it or break it.

I was studying communication design in Australia and used to work as a waitress at a small Indian restaurant in Melbourne. After some 3 months of waitressing, I was pretty settled at the place. Used to look forward to meeting new people and have our last meal together with that chilled beer and a late night drive to home.

Sometimes our manager would get orders for catering and he was always short staffed and only hired girls. A lot of times he had to refuse as he didn't want the girls carrying all the heavy stuff and he couldn't leave the restaurant to go do it himself.

Once he got an order for an Indian engagement party where we had to make biryani for some 150 people. It was a big order for someone as small as us. Client wanted someone from the restaurant to serve at the party too. For some reason (maybe because I had a car), my boss chose me. It was a one hour drive, with my car full of biryani (I'm a huge biryani fan!) and me dressed in black, ready to serve families. I was pretty nervous. I was imagining all those judgmental eyes trying to picture how poor my family must be to let me be a waitress at a small Indian restaurant.

When I reached the venue, I realised I had to carry the containers myself since I was the first one to reach. After carrying huge food containers, people started coming in and I was setting up tables, hoping to avoid eye contact because that very moment, I was just a waitress who was dressed in her fav black shirt n black trousers trying to avoid conversations with judgmental Indian families living abroad. I could imagine them calling my dad n telling him how they feel to see his daughter serve other people when she should be out doing something more respectable. My brain wandered to places and what my parents would think of me if they saw me lost like this. While I was in that rotten world, smell of biryani woke me up. As dramatic as it sounds, it was that smell of home and how good food can fix everything in the world, pumped me up.

I uncovered the lids, poured biryani in the serving containers, ran around to find spoons and plates.

Bride's family was very sweet and tried making conversations with me but all in vain. After an hour, I was back to being myself. I had said no to putting on make up as aunties were getting ready just about anywhere they found a mirror or if they spotted me dressed in just black for an Indian engagement.

Soon I was out there like a pro waiter, serving food and even taking feedback from everybody and I was comfortable in my skin. I don't know how exactly it happened but now I'm glad it did as its important to go through the awkward moments just so you can appreciate the non-awkward moments. Strange is good.

And as it turns out, the client family came the next day to thank me for helping them serve, gave a gift n asked for one more event later. I had left the country by then :)

Anything from the heart, works.

Do share some of your awkward yet learning moments, would be happy to know you better.

December 2014,10,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/12/10/remembering-montana/,"December 2014, 10",Remembering Montana,"I miss Montana.

In 2009, I was just about to finish my dissertation and I had accepted my first job – a tenure-track position at a small liberal arts college in Montana.  I was moving to Montana from Chicago, and I was excited – but also apprehensive.  My anxiety came from a few places.  First, just the idea of starting the job itself – being the one in charge, and standing in front of a room of students who wanted me to have the answers – was fairly terrifying.  Then, there was the more immediate anxiety of leaving my wife behind in Chicago.  She had one year left in her grad program, so I was headed out West on my own.  And then, there was concern about Montana itself.  I had visited the campus for my interview, and I fell in love with the college and the town.  But, a visit was one thing, living there another.  While I was not a Chicago native, I knew I loved the city tremendously and just didn’t know how I would function anywhere else – especially someplace so much less urban.

When I packed up and headed out, my dad traveled with me.  We stopped at Mount Rushmore and we drove through the Badlands.  We followed a semi through a reservation, and it was the darkest night either of us had ever seen.  And with every mile, I realize now, I was slowly falling in love with the mountain West.

Montana is spectacular:  raw and wild.  Drive just a few minutes out of town, and there simply are no people.  Just amazing mountain views everywhere you turn.   I took a float down the river with some friends, and fished for the first time.  I was terrible at it, but I had a blast.  We were out too late, and I remember sitting in the raft, looking up, and seeing the Milky Way for the first time in a very long time.  I visited the state and national parks often, and regularly took long drives just to explore.  I was never, ever disappointed and often awe-struck.

 The people were just as fascinating as the scenery:  my neighbor was an artist, a potter, but also a carpenter and a Western ware model.  People brought small children to bars.  People were polite and friendly and everything was casual.   I still miss the local brewery.

Even the things that were hard about Montana I remember fondly.  Even the cold.  It was cold there like I had never personally experienced before.  I used to plug in my engine block warmer on the coldest nights.  I remember one day it was so cold my car frosted on the inside as I drove to work, even after sitting and warming for a few minutes.  It felt like, in some small way, me versus the elements.  It was an adventure.

I miss other places.  I still miss Chicago something horrible.  I miss my hometown, and the place I went to college.  But none of those places got under my skin and into my bones quite as fast as Montana.

Work took me away from Montana, and I haven’t been back in a few years.   My wife and I have a small child now, and planning travel isn’t always easy.  But I know, deep down, that I can’t not go back to Montana.

I am a 28 year-old guy from the Dominican Republic, (a nice place in the Caribbean) and I want to talk to you about a hobby I started last year. Have you ever heard about Postcrossing? When was the last time you received a postcard?  When was the last time you sent a postcard?

Well, Postcrossing is a nice Project that allows you to “send a postcard and received a postcard back from a random person in the world”.  More than a hobby I found this project as a way to learn about other cultures; every postcard I received has its own story, its own mystic.

How it works?

The first step is to register on the Postcrossing site (You can google it: Postcrossing). Then you would be able to request to send a postcard. The website will display (and send you an email) with the address of another member and a Postcard ID (e.g.: US-786). You then mail a postcard to that member.

The member receives the postcard and registers it using the Postcard ID that is on the postcard. At this point, you are eligible to receive a postcard from another user. You are now in line for the next person that requests to send a postcard. Where the postcard comes from is a surprise!

You can have up to 5 postcards traveling at any single time. Every time one of the postcards you send is registered, you can request another address. The number of postcards allowed to travel at any single time goes up the more postcards you send!

A simple request...

I’d like to hear from you guys, would you mind sending me a postcard from where you are?

Tell me something about you, what’s your hobby? What do you do?

“in societies or individuals, a condition of instability resulting from a breakdown of standards and values or from a lack of purpose or ideals.”

In “The Abolition of Man” and elsewhere, C.S. Lewis predicted that this would be the trajectory of a society that repudiates objective values. Here are some quotes, what do you think?

""Human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and can't really get rid of it.""

""A great many of those who 'debunk' traditional...values have in the background values of their own which they believe to be immune from the debunking process.""

“You cannot go on 'explaining away' for ever: you will find that you have explained explanation itself away. You cannot go on 'seeing through' things for ever. The whole point of seeing through something is to see something through it. To “see through” all things is the same as not to see.”

""If nothing is self-evident, nothing can be proved. Similarly if nothing is obligatory for its own sake, nothing is obligatory at all.""

""If naturalism were true then all thoughts whatever would be wholly the result of irrational causes...it cuts its own throat.""

“In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful.”

""A creature revolting against a creator is revolting against the source of his own powers--including even his power to revolt...It is like the scent of a flower trying to destroy the flower.""

Albert Camus writes about our beloved Sisyphus in his essay, The Myth of Sisyphus, but turns Sisyphus' monotonous and rather tragic punishment into something beautiful. He says that the struggle itself is enough to fill a man's heart. He concludes the essay with: ""One must imagine Sisyphus happy."" This is, by far, one of my favorite quotes. You can read more about The Myth of Sisyphus on Wikipedia. However, The Myth of Sisyphus is not my favorite Wikipedia page. My favorite Wikipedia page is called ""List of potato dishes"" and I plan on making every single dish on that list eventually before I die.

December 2014,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/12/06/no-subject/,"December 2014, 06",[no subject],"Growing up, my parents fought and argued a lot. This fighting extended to families on both sides. I rarely saw any expression of love amongst the grownups. The funny thing is though, I remember not feeling anything. I wasn’t necessarily upset; I was just so good at shutting off that part of my life. However, at times it would get extreme. This one time, my mother decided that she can't take life with my Dad anymore and she simply wanted to die. She said that she would do this by starving herself as any other means would be sinful. I remember begging her to eat after watching her starve for a day or two. I didn't get why in the world she would do something like that back then. I understand now though. She didn't want to die, she loved us too much. She loved me even more. She really needed her husband to care. She was getting sick and frail. The new business they had opened was consuming her health and she was turning into skin and bone working day and night. Her already fragile health was deteriorating right in front of our eyes. My Dad was a workaholic, very well respected medical professional in the community, but did not have it in him to understand my mother's pain. Most nights he'd stay out at night drinking and smoking and numerous times my mom has had to go out looking for him in the bars/streets. She's my hero for pulling through all of that and for having successfully ingrained the importance of family in my Dad's head. She is so strong. I wonder sometimes if I should have spoken up and told her to leave him, but times were different back then and I was in denial about any of what was happening. I started thinking about what happened during my childhood a lot more recently. I needed to dig deeper to explain to myself why I was not like my friends. I was never insecure about anything growing up. I looked good enough for me, I did great in school and I had no trouble making friends. I wasn't caring at all though, especially to people who were not immediately related to me or very close to me. Showing care felt like undressing a burn where the gauze would stay stuck to the wound while you try to remove it. It was very painful, It felt physically impossible to do, I couldn't even fake it. It's not like that anymore though. After several toxic relationships where the men were never really with me or cared really all that much about me, which made me crazy mad of course and led to fights which felt like home, I  finally figured it out. Once I made the connection, I was reborn. I cared, in fact I cared enormously. I cared about everyone. It didn't matter whether I knew them or not. I cared about them and I cared about their story. It's a much better world to live in when we care about eachother:)

This process led to so many good things in my life. One of which was finding the man of my dreams. I can't imagine life without him. I have a great relationship with my family and friends I've gotten to know during my journey. I'm not all better, but knowing the root of my problems has helped me to actively fight it and do better. I do not have the greatest health condition. I've inherited my mother's systemic disease and got another life long condition as well that gives me pain all the time. I rarely focus on it though, which is why I don't tell people about it. I focus on how to manage it so as to improve my life.

Write to me! I hope this glimpse of my journey was a bit interesting to some of you.

December 2014,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/12/05/sunrise-beach/,"December 2014, 05",Sunrise Beach,"There are many stories about being in a rock band that you don’t hear. Not the stories of groupies in the green room, or creative differences that lead to brawls in the studio, or snorting cocaine off the mixing desk - those stories are well recorded, and are becoming a tired cliché. Here are a couple of my thoughts on playing in a band.

I live in Australia, on the Sunshine Coast. I've been making music since I was 12. This year my band released our first three music videos.

The last one to be released is my favourite, and I shot it all in one day in the city. I was working in a restaurant (yes, we’re all still working part-time, paying the bills) with a French girl, Camille, and she had one of those faces that just begs to be on film. We took a day off and drove down to the closest city, Brisbane, with my brother, who sings on the track.

The problem was, I had absolutely no idea what I was going to shoot.

Somehow, by the end of the day, I had a drive full of footage, most of it shot with little idea in mind how I’d use it, and within a few days I’d edited it into a satisfying and unified collection of images. They had no logical story, but they connected with the song’s themes - the prismatic experience of life in the world coupled with a deep sense of yearning.

DECIDING ON A BAND NAMETortuous. You sit around for days, cycling through random words and phrases until they become meaningless sounds, filling your mouth like over-chewed cud. Every band name you think is even slightly good you find via internet is already taken. “Bored of Directors? Really? Somebody already named their band that!? Eventually we all gave up and decided that naming the band after where we were currently living was actually a genius idea. Luckily, we were living at Sunrise Beach at the time.

TOURING WITH BROTHERS WHO ALSO HAPPEN TO BE BAND MATESEventually, one of you will snap. Cooped up in a car driving through endless Australian country towns (Australia is a bloody big country!), before you know it, the smallest thing will break you, and being brothers, there is no filter on what you will say.

“I hate it when you eat strawberries! The smell fills the car! You’re constantly eating over-ripe fruit, and I know you’re only doing it to annoy me.”

“STOP breathing through your nose so loudly!”

GUITAR LEADS ARE THE BANE OF YOUR EXISTENCESomehow, no matter what you do, no matter how expensive the leads you buy, you always end up with a black tangle that takes far too long to untie at the end of a gig. When do we get roadies, please?

ESOTERIC THOUGHTS ON MUSICMusic is like a glue that connects people invisibly. Sound is the fundamental vibration from which everything else arises. In Hindu philosophy, the universe was created by the sound Om, and the Bible says “In the beginning was the Word”. Think about how music in a movie heightens emotions dramatically, or how a whole crowd of people can connect through a song being played. This is what I’ve always been interested in creating: music with emotional resonance, music that has the power to forge connections.

Thanks for reading. If you’re interested in seeing the music video that I talked about making, it’s called Red Placard, and my band is called Sunrise Beach.

Why am I not replying to Robbie directly, rather than posting to thelist? I thought it would be fun to introduce a little publicconversation over the list itself.

I have a background (Ph. D.) in moral philosophy. Coincidentally, theday I won TheListServe lottery was also my last day at work beforeretiring. I retired early, in part so I could devote more time andenergy to ""doing good"". I read Peter Singer  in the early 1980s andhave been a supporter of Oxfam America or similar organizations forover 30 years. However, while I am an effective altruist veteran, Ihave my doubts.

About three years ago, I decided to pick an issue and a location tosee if I could gain a more local and better informed perspective abouta particular problem. I picked malaria and western Kenya. Back then Ithought malaria was the do-gooder's low hanging fruit. Malaria seemedlike a simple problem.  If people are protected from mosquitoes, theywon't contract malaria. So hand out bed nets for $10 a net and save achild's life.

Unfortunately, fighting malaria is not so simple. Bed nets seem to behelping in some marginal areas, but at least in western Kenya, wherethe parasite is endemic, Kenya's long-term bed net program is notwinning the war on malaria. The nets make sleeping more uncomfortableby hindering air circulation, require maintenance when torn, andretreatment when the ""long-lasting"" insecticide wears off.

Several years ago, Bill and Melinda Gates, Ray Chambers, and othersstarted a global campaign to eliminate virtually all deaths frommalaria by 2015. Most professionals who work in the field thought thegoal was wildly unrealistic. Unfortunately, the pessimists were right.The deadline is almost here and we are not even close. Now Gates ishoping to eliminate malaria in his lifetime. I am not abandoning thefight against malaria as a worthwhile pursuit. The problem stillfascinates me, but I no longer think it is an easy one to solve.

At first it seems rational to think in terms of ""maximizing"" good. Ifyou want to do good and you can do more good with the same amount ofmoney, then you ought to opt for the choice that does the most good.That is fine in principle. However, I wonder if the uncertainties ofdoing good call for more moral humility. If Gates and others had aless ambitious goal, would they have succeeded?

What about the rest of us?  Many people just want to do some good, notthe most good they can. Aiming for the most good can seem arrogant ornaive. What if you have more passion about a cause with which you havea personal connection? Will your commitment be greater and longerlasting if you pursue that cause rather than follow therecommendations of WiseGiving?

I would love to hear from others who are interested in effectivealtruism or malaria.

Assuming (rather optimistically) that every Listservian will spend two minutes reading this, that's 813 hours of collective human time, or about twenty 40-hour work weeks.

What would you devote yourself to if you had almost half a year of working time?

I wish that people - e.g. the creators of silly apps, or people at work who schedule meetings for way more people than necessary - thought more about the opportunity costs of time.  With this in mind, thank you for your sacred time.

Without further ado, let me serve you with a list (so sorry, I just had to) that I hope will make this time worth it for you:

One word: ""Sonder"" - look up its definition on the website ""Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.""

One quotation: from Kurt Vonnegut, “We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.”

One poem: ""The Jabberwocky” by Lewis Carroll.  Language is a strange thing.

One book: ""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy.  I finished it while sitting in a high school hallway at a debate tournament, and had to wipe away tears when my opponent and judge arrived.

One speech: David Foster Wallace's ""This Is Water"" should be required reading / listening at least once a year.

One concept: Fundamental Attribution Error - basically (and I'm oversimplifying) a scientific explanation of the advice to ""be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.""

One film: Interstellar.  You know a movie has engaged you when you're still listening to the soundtrack and thinking about its ideas weeks later.  One thought that it's prompted, in a roundabout way, is that any sort of recorded communication is time travel, albeit in only one direction - you're conveying your current thoughts to someone at a different time.  A dramatic example of this would be a book written by a long-dead author, getting a glimpse into a mind that hasn't existed for years.  I guess this email would be a less extreme example, since this will be sent a day after I submit it.

One habit: journaling, which I've recently re-started.  Look up the article ""How Keeping a Diary Can Surprise You"" in the New York Times - you'll thank yourself later for journaling.

One painting: “Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bumblebee around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening” by Salvador Dali.  Capture your dreams in your journal, along with those fringe, semi-conscious thoughts you have as you're drifting in the zone between wakefulness and sleep.

One band: Typhoon.  They blow me out of the water with every track (but seriously, this group makes amazing music).

One preachy puzzle (easy to solve with the aid of the Internet, and therein lies the irony): 01001000 01110101 01101101 01100001 01101110 01110011 00100000 01100001 01110010 01100101 00100000 01101101 01101111 01110010 01100101 00100000 01110100 01101000 01100001 01101110 00100000 01100100 01100001 01110100 01100001

One question: What's an idea you have for improving life - not ambitious or earth-shattering, but trivial or everyday?  For example, I've thought that if walls had rounded or diagonal edges instead of corners, there would be so many fewer awkward near-collisions of people in or around buildings.

One shout-out: Happy early birthday, sis!

One post-script: I love you, dearest.

I'm just kidding ;) I don't want to give any advice for your life. Everyone should do what they want as long as it doesn't harm others.

I am a 24 year-old Math and Economics student at University of Dortmund, Germany and I really don't know what to write. So I just wanted to say „Thank you“. First of all thank you to The Listserve and its members for this interesting project. I love to read about other peoples lifes and stories in such an authentic way. I am also very thankful for my life. I don't believe in God but I think you can be thankful anyway. I am lucky to have loving family and friends that are healthy and love me for who I am. For me, the most important thing ist to know that you're being loved by someone.

After an unhealthy relationship and one year of being single I found the perfect girl last summer. We met at a party and made out quite quickly (there was alcohol). Two days later we met again and discovered how many things we have in common. From that day on, we saw each other every day and really fell in love. I often think about how unlikely it was for exactly the two of us to meet at that party, kiss and later discover all these similarities. She thinks it was fate but I am more the coincidence-type.

Speaking of coincidence... When I was notified that i had won The Listserve lottery I felt very lucky at first. But then I was wondering if I really was lucky or if the time period i am subscribed to The Listserve was just long enough for this to be likely to happen. Because I am only subscribed for a few months now, I know there was much luck going on, but I was interested in the probabilities anyway. So I worked out a formula where you can calculate the probability of winning in a time period of your choice. Here are some results:

The probabilty you win

-tomorrow: 0.004%-within the next month: 0.13%-within the next year: 1.32%-within the next 10000 days: 10.08%

Assumptions: The growth rate continues to be 25 subscribers per day and you can't win twice (otherwise the probabilities would be a little bit lower).

So I indeed was very lucky to win The Listserve lottery.

I'll be on vacation in Thailand and Cambodia in Feburary and if you know anything exciting/interesting to see/do there besides the main tourist stuff (Bangkok, Angkor Wat) I'd be happy to hear it :). Also my girlfriend and I want to take a short trip within Europe for New Year's and we don't know where to go yet. It could be something crowded and exciting or something quiet and romantic. Feel free to send me suggestions or anything else you want to say.

I wish you all the best!

JustusDortmund, Germany

P.S. The formula I used (I'm sorry if I made any major mistakes):sum from i=1 to n over: [ 100/(23432 – i + 25*i) ]n: number of days you want to look aheadi: counting variable23432: people who didn't win yet (minus 1 winner a day, plus 25 new subscribers a day)

All the probabilities may be a bit higher because i didn't consider the case when someone doesn't write an E-Mail and someone new is chosen. A good approximation up to a year that is easier to calculate is:

(100*n) / (23432 + 24*n)"

I’m only 55.”  Saint Peter checks his book. “Actually, you’re late – we added up your billable hours and you’re 110 years old”. Lawyers, eh?

I used to be a lawyer. For nearly 6 years, first in Amsterdam, then in London.

On a holiday I was reading the 4 Hour Work Week when I jumped up and yelled at my (by then frightened) girlfriend: I’ve made a mistake, being a lawyer is not SCALABLE, aaargh!

I made a bold plan to come into work the next week, quit, get my hands on an Aston Martin, start a better version of Facebook and execute various other killer plans. I was going to live the dream.

But as you may have guessed, a couple of years later, I was still at the law firm. A seed had been planted though and I made a decision to actually quit, for real this time!

Looking back, the hardest part was walking into my boss’ office to tell him. We got along really well and I was afraid it would disappoint him somehow.

It actually took three attempts before I finally walked in. On the first two, I pussied out and decided to make a blank copy on the copy machine right outside his office.

My goodbye email to the rest of the firm was leaked – you can find it by searching “Binsbergen Resignation Letter” – and I was free to do what I wanted.

Now I’m building a legal startup called “Lexoo”. We help businesses get fixed quotes from multiple UK lawyers, all working on a low overhead basis (if you google “Lexoo” you can find out more).

So far it’s working out. It’s nice not to wear a suit. Our investors are great guys. And a large bunch of customers are using our service. Turns out that companies reaaaally hate overpaying on legal work, so we’re solving a problem.

What about you guys? Any funny, crazy or disturbing lawyer stories? I wrote a free entrepreneur’s guide with insider’s tips and tricks on how to deal with lawyers (google: “Lexoo book”). I’d love to update it with your stories!

I’ll end with a Woody Allen quote that always makes me smile:

“Some men are heterosexual and some men are bisexual and some men don’t think about sex at all, you know, they become lawyers.”

Find me on twitter or send me an e-mail, I would love to hear from you!

January 2014: I quit my excruciating job and packed my bags to move to San Francisco from New York. I miss NYC every single day, it really is a place you should live in atleast once in your life, it will change your life forever (maybe for good, maybe for bad)

February 2014: I parked myself at a friend's place and decided to go travel (ofcourse) and went to South East Asia (ofcourse) for a few months. I am so thankful for amazing friends!

May 2014: Came back and fun serendipitous things that usually are reserved for more fortunate started happening to me!

July 2014: I was convinced I would move to India unless I found a job, I found a fantastic job

August 2014: I was convinced I would quit my new job and move to India unless I met someone special, I met someone VERY special; I might be in love with him :)

October 2014: Found a fantastic apartment in SAN FRANCISCO! Rental market here is worse than NYC incase you were wondering! It’s more of a supply/ demand thing, I get it!

November 2014: My very close friend decided to move to LA so now I am wondering if I should push my luck and threaten fate that I'd move to India unless I won a multi-million $ lottery ha!

Anyway, I started a new chapter in my life this year. Love, life and a great apartment! Does a girl need more in San Francisco? Yes, yes she does. I could use a great taco. If you are from here or have been here and have suggestions for delicious tacos (or food in general), please let me know! I promise to add it to my list for the taco crawl and let you know how I liked it. I like crawls. If you live in NYC please go to Taqueria LES on Orchard St. Get the carnitas taco. It will blow your mind.

That's all I have today. No advice from me, I wouldn't be very good at it if I tried. Its Thanksgiving time and I'll spare y'll the mundane but I will say please be thankful for what you have, you are definitely more fortunate than most if you have a laptop where you are reading this email. Threaten fate every so often, sometimes it surprises you!

Have a lovely Thanksgiving and a wonderful Christmas!!

Love,Avani (Avni is how you pronounce it, means Earth! Isn't that cool? My parents are the best!)

PS: I want to start a microfinance organization someday and also a school where kids especially women get education for free. If you have ideas, stories, experiences with either please email me! Especially if you tried and failed! Not to undermine the successes, but failures end up getting better life experiences..

PPS: I hate Uber. Look up the recent slew of insanities by the company and their drivers. As a woman I find the company's culture abhorrent. What are your thoughts about the company? If you don't have an opinion, I say form one. Let me know. I love hearing different perspectives and often change mine. I accept that I know very little.

Love,

November 2014,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/11/29/a-hoptimist-telling-nonsense/,"November 2014, 29",a hoptimist telling nonsense,"Hi @ all out there!

When I received the notification that I've won ""The Listserve lottery"" I was sitting on the train’s floor on my way to work. My non-dog-dog (too tiny for being a dog too smart for being a cat) was sitting on my lap licking a specific spot on my trousers. And I was deleting thousands of spam mails, almost falling asleep and trying to keep my eyes open (I almost deleted the notification).

I’ve lost my job and there are – three days, 8 hours per days – 24 hours left. I’ve been working there since I’ve left school and started the 10th year with the 2nd of November. I got told on 12thAugust -  one day after I returned to work after I had to stay at home cause of a knee injury - that I’m fired. My boss asked me for an appointment, and I asked him if I was in troubles. “No, nothing special… just a 15 min-talk” was his answer. When I got told on the other day I started laughing at him and congratulated him for having the stones to do so. He looked at me as I’m a moon calf and yes I’m.

I don’t talk much about myself, but here – dear strangers – are some facts:

## I’m weird and crazy and not very tall. I’m a student, photographer, graphic designer, illustrator,… creative person. I was silly enough working there for 9 years, part-time studying and full-time working. I’m sometimes pusillanimous and sheepish but also stubborn as a mule and I’ve started to like the person I am just in that specific moment, when I started laughing at my soon-2-be-ex-boss.## I got told from my father – and yeah, your parents should be telling you that you are the smartest and most awesome child in the world – that I’m crazy, dumb and so on for 25 years. The last time I’ve talked to him (the day before he moved out and the day before my parents got divorced) he yelled some really bad things at me and I started laughing and congratulated him for not having the stones to accept me as the person I’m.## I really hate my eldest brother, cause he did some really bad stuff to me. I’ve never told all of it to anybody and for years I was persuading myself, that it has been my fault. To be honest I don’t really hate him, I just don’t take care of him anymore and started to take care of myself.## My grandpa was more like my father than my father was. He was an awesome person and when he passed away in September 2010, some of my family-members thought I didn’t sorrow. But we had some really long talk in May 2010 and it was also the moment, when he said good-bye to me. After this day he was not the same anymore, he didn’t even recognize his wife and I was everyone – his daughter, his wife, old friends etc. Cause of this awesome person I’m studying and trying to do things I really want to do. Thx.## I have Aim. Not only an aim – I really have many. But I’ve Aim – aka Amy, non-dog-dog. And the reason I got her, was cause I needed something to take care of, as it was a tough time for me and I didn’t take care of myself. It was after my parent’s divorce, my grandpa’s death and accepting, that it wasn’t my fault, what happened when I was younger.

So as you can see, I’m not in the position in giving you some good advices for your life. I’m not the right person in telling you how you’ve to live your life.

I’m a “hoptimist” - a hopeful optimist.And I’m a hoptimist all time.

My friend is working in Kurdish republic and I know what’s going on there.Someone I know is working in Mali – (the Ebola virus epidemic around Mali has led to thousands of deaths).A friend of mine – who always wanted to have children – has got told, that she suffers from cervival cancer some weeks ago.…

I’m not the right person in giving you some good advices. I’m just trying to give my best and to change the world in some (good/better/acceptable/wonderful/awesome) way.

I’m not a genius and I won’t find the global solution for every problem out there.I’m trying to give my best – trying to make good graphic design (and not to accept bad one) to make our world a little more beautiful. I’m photographing to record (social) wrongs and bloom sides. I’m photographing and illustrating to make things visual. I’m trying to raise my voice whenever something bad happens.

I believe that we all can change the world in some way. And we all together can change it to a better place for everybody.

I’m a hoptimist.And I started to believe in myself in August when I started to do what I want. I’m working together with my friend (who is the world’s best photographer – just had to mention that) – and although that was something I didn’t thought it would work - we already completed some nice joint projects since August. Music Posters, CI for start-ups, …

As we all know that a Listserve-mail without advices wouldn’t work or be right some random advices for you:

Believe in yourself - do some cool stuff - let’s do something together - drink more coffee – let’s help each other – read more books (the real books) – if you own a pet, cuddle it – if you own a dog one extra cuddle for it – kiss your friend more often – tell persons you love that you do so more often – do what you want, it will make you happy – lets swap some work – tell me something – write me a letter or a mail or just tell me to f* off – read the sandman-comics – listen to good music – if you have to, fart in the public – do something special in your spare time – don’t let the world end in a disaster – raise your voice against wrongs – Bananas make one constipated – if you are afraid, eat more bananas – watch some good films (really good ones) – insert some random advices here.

Greets and so

Any recommendations for how I should celebrate?Second: What books, music, or movies do you lend to others?

When I walk into a bookstore or a library, I get an instant feeling of lightness. The smell of the books, the quiet movement of people, the light filtering in through the windows and skylights. The overwhelming visual stimulation of color, shapes, and sizes, bookshelves placed end to end, filling the space everywhere you look. It’s a feeling of sheer possibility, of weight lifting.I get a similar feeling when I walk into a museum or a movie theater, knowing I am about to discover something- something curious, something interesting, something awesome. Delicious.

I’ve tried to write my own stories before, to participate. I get about 3 chapters in and give up. I love creating worlds and characters, but plotting a story? I don’t want that responsibility- to put in the hard work or make agonizing decisions. I’m content to consume the stories told by others and feel a sense of vicarious victory when things work out just so, to marvel at the cleverness of the creators.

I love the escapism of science fiction and fantasy, of adventure and romance, for adults and young adults alike. Stories have such impact- the alternate lives, careers, and realities I can experience through someone else’s imagination result in endless curiosity and child-like joy. Even re-reading stories I know and love can instantly improve a bad day as I cease to exist for a few hours.

Yes, consuming stories is satisfying.And sharing stories is, as well.

I love physical books, DVDs, CDs, etc, because I can lend them out to friends and colleagues. Yes, I want them to find something new and amazing, but it’s also partly selfish-this extends the story for me since I now get to re-experience the joy of discovery through their progress, laughing and cringing and remembering all over again.

To that effect, and for you, here are the stories I lend out, recommend, and often revisit myself:

-Stray, by Andrea K Host. “I walked into adventure and adventure has given me blisters.”-The Thief, by Megan Whalen Turner.-All of Tamora Pierce’s Tortall series of books, particularly the Protector of the Small quadrology-The Emperor’s Soul, by Brandon Sanderson, a modern and satisfying fairy tale-Star Wars X-Wing series, by Michael A Stackpole and Aaron Allston, adventure and fun-Ender’s Game and Ender’s Shadow, by Orson Scott Card-The Philadelphia Story with Cary Grant, Kathryn Hepburn, and Jimmy Stewart-Stranger than Fiction with Will Farrell, charming and overlooked-Fred Astaire “Isn’t This a Lovely Day”-The Ink Spots “Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall”-The Avett Brothers “Kickdrum Heart”-The Features “Idea of Growing Old”-Yellow Ostrich “I think U are great”-Rufus Wainwright “Want Two” Album-Typhoon’s “White Lighter” Album-Cold War Kid’s “Robbers & Cowards” Album-“Things Could be Worse” The Tragedy Series by Benjamin Dewey-Visit Austin, in Central Texas, between March 23 and April 23. The temperature is still crisp, the bluebonnets are everywhere, the grass practically glows, and it overwhelming feels of Spring and wellbeing. Check out the Bob Bullock Texas State History Museum while you are there.

I’d love to hear back if you check these out. That’s the point!

Thanks, and Gig ‘Em, Aggies,

November 2014,27,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/11/27/living-with-a-prankster/,"November 2014, 27",Living with a Prankster,"Hey Listserve,

I'll start with a little bit about myself. I'm 25, live in Santa Monica, California, and work as an Actor/Producer/YouTuber. For those of you that live in the US or Canada, you may know my father, Howie Mandel, from shows such as Deal or No Deal and America's Got Talent. He's a comedian and I'll say I've had a very interesting childhood growing up.

I want to share a funny Joke my dad played on me when I was in 5th grade. I noticed one day that there was a slight lump on the center of my chest. My parents were worried and took me to the Doctor. After the visit the doctor told my parents that it was nothing to worry about and it was just a small harmless extra bone. My dad convinced the doctor to play a joke with him and tell me it's something else. My dad explained that what I have is a ""boner."" Of course being the young immature boy I was, I laughed. He explained that although it sounds funny, the word actually referenced a growth off another bone which in turn gave meaning to the derogatory term. Made sense to me. He said I probably shouldn't do Physical education at school. The next day I went to class and before we began, I raised my hand in front of the rest of the students and said ""I can't do class today because I have a boner."" Everyone laughed and I was sent to the office. I tried to explain its a real medical condition, but she called my mom. When she told my mom, I could hear her on the other side yell ""Howie!"" My dad had to make a formal apology to the school and I was completely embarrassed.

I hope you enjoyed that father son experience I went through and gave you a good laugh.

November 2014,26,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/11/26/what-is-effective-altruism/,"November 2014, 26",What is effective altruism?,"Hey!

I want to make the world a better place, and do so in the most effective way possible. This approach is known as “effective altruism” and this email is a short introduction.

Let's say you have some money that you want to donate to charity. That's great, but how do you decide which charity to donate to? Here are a couple of options:

Charity A: will save 1 life with your donationCharity B: will save 1000 lives with your donation

Is it a hard choice? I don't think so, and this isn't a hypothetical question.

It turns out that charities vary wildly in their effectiveness. Even for a given cause, like stopping the spread of HIV, some charities will literally do 1000x more good with your money than others.

How do you figure out which are the most effective charities? It's a hard problem, but luckily there are a number of people who spend their time figuring this out for you. GiveWell and Giving What We Can do extensive research into how much good charities can do, publishing their results online.

A specific example of an effective charity is the Against Malaria Foundation, which distributes insecticide treated nets to protect against malarial infections. Another is Deworm The World, which works to prevent and cure parasitic worms in children. These tropical diseases can be extremely easy and cheap to cure, often costing just a few dollars.

There's a growing movement, called ""effective altruism,"" around this approach to doing good. Identify the most effective ways to improve the world, then go and do those things. This can be applied to donations, volunteering, or even career choice. Members of the effective altruism community have pledged to donate hundreds of millions of dollars to the best causes over their lifetimes.

If any of this has sparked your interest, do one of the following:

- Talk to me! I’m happy to chat, just reply to this email!

- Visit GiveWell’s website to see their charity recommendations.

- Watch Peter Singer's recent TED talk about effective altruism (google it).

I could tell you why but I just need a break. A quick nap. Some time to sleep or a marathon of The Wire.

I’d love to read a book. I’m reading the Woodcutters right now. It’s great. Or it would be great if I had more time to read. I am graduating in six months. People ask me what I am doing after graduation. I should know. I am told that I really should know. But I have not a clue. I don’t think about it nearly as much as they seem to think I do. I only think about the future when I am reminded that I have one.

This isn’t meant to be some philosophical discussion. I am not particularly philosophical. That was one of the reasons my boyfriend broke up with me. I do not think about the deep questions in life. It’s only been a month. I am still bitter. I don’t miss him or at least I don’t feel as though my heart is broken. I think about him throughout the days. I think of Us. Or well, the Us that used to exist. I guess now we’re just him and me.

I cried in the park for two hours last week. Strangers stared and I made eye contact. They looked uncomfortable being caught with their curiosity. Why is this girl crying? More importantly why not? I am not ashamed to cry. I cry often. I like crying.

I am having a hard time.

I am an exceptional quitter. I am so good at quitting that I have given motivational speeches about quitting. My talent in quitting comes from the second grade when I quit football. The cold Saturday mornings and my shyness did not create an environment conducive for football stardom. My parents encouraged my talent.

As I’ve gotten older, quitting has gotten harder. Suddenly, I face responsibilities and feelings of “I signed up for this.” How do I quit? Can I quit? Turns out you can always quit. Most notably, I quit my summer internship a few months ago.

Quitting has no bearing on who I am. I may be a quitter but I am also pretty freakin’ awesome.

I forgive myself for crying in the park, for being sad, for being confused. In 21 years, I have not made many friends. The kinda friends where I think hey you! You human being, I like you, spend time with me. I forgive myself for not having made those friends.

I forgive myself for all the times that I have quit and all the times that I will in the future. I forgive myself for being broken up with.

I don’t have any particular advice as I am not very wise nor have I had something insane happen to me. I once found $100 on the sidewalk so I do have that going for me. Maybe life isn’t so bad.

Send me something. I promise I will read it. Maybe not immediately but probably immediately. It can be a sentence, a poem, or your 50,000-word harry potter fanfic.

And as I am currently writing this I'm still a little out of sorts, so I apologize if some of this doesn't quite make sense.

As to why I was getting surgery I was going in for my second corneal transplant. I had one done a few months ago and my body decided to reject it. While there are someways of reversing it those methods didn't work. So here I am sitting in a hospital while my eye is tearing up like mad and can't see well out of my other eye listening to cooking shows cause it's ten o'clock at night and nothing is good on.

I know for a large majority of the world you wake up turn over and are able to see your clock or your phone or significant other and don't give two thoughts about it. Those are the things I would love to be able to do. I would love to be able to read a standard print book without it giving me a headache. I normally give up within about twenty minutes. I would like not be so nervous going into the DMV to get my license renewed for fear that I would fail the vision screening. The day I moved into my dorm I had to put in night lights in all the hallways of our apartment so I wouldn't trip over my own two feet in the dark. My roommate a few days later while she was a little drunk asked me if I was afraid of the dark. I would love for my sister not be afraid of getting into a car with me. Not because I'm technically a bad driver, `cause she worried I won't see something and we'll end up in an accident.

I'm not ashamed of having this disease. I will easily and gladly tell people about it. But there somethings that when you have perfect or a corrected sight are hard to explain. Some people wish for money and better job. I wish that my vision wasn't as bad as it is. Before the surgery, I was 20/400 uncorrected and corrected I am 20/120. Legally blind is 20/200 corrected. I'm nearly there. I wholeheartedly believe that my vision will get better after this. That's what I'm holding on to.

So as a final word please get an eye exam regularly. It may seem silly if you feel like you're seeing fine but there are many problems that a regular doctor won't be able to see like a optometrist can. Also please become a donor. You can't say you would accept a donation if you were sick and in the same breathe say that you're not a donor. It doesn't work that way. If you believe that you have health conditions that would make it so that your organs wouldn't be viable there are many different ways for the medical and scientific community to use them. There are also ways to make so you only donate certain parts if that's your decision. Even if you choose not to become an organ donor, there are many other types of donation ranging from blood to bone marrow that could save someones life. Please do give it some deep thought.

I wish you all the best of luck.

Ancient Egypt was one of the first cultures to develop medicine in a sense that we would recognize today. Egyptian medicine even influenced many great Greek physicians, like the father of medicine, Hippocrates. In the Odyssey, Homer remarks that ""In Egypt, the men are more skilled in medicine than any of human kind.""

Despite their advanced medicine for the times, there was a disease for which no cure was known. Even the symptoms seemed baffling, but a diagnosis was a certain death sentence. The Egyptians called it a ""too great emptying of the urine"". Indian physicians referred to it as ""honey urine"", since the diagnosed's urine would attract ants. In the Middle Ages it would come to be known as ""pissing evil"". But it was the Greeks who coined the term that stuck: ""diabetes"" or ""to pass through"".

Unfortunately, none of these ancient civilizations came up with a method for managing the disease. In fact, we have to skip way ahead to 1921 before a breakthrough happens. Two Canadian researchers, Frederick Grant Banting and Charles Herbert Best, discover that by injecting insulin produced by the pancreases of healthy dogs into diabetic dogs, the diabetic dogs' conditions improved. They realized that without functioning insulin, the body's blood glucose levels would keep rising until they reached a fatal range. This huge step forward has allowed millions to manage the disease.

Type 1 diabetes is a specific form of the disease where the body's immune system attacks the pancreas, rendering it unable to supply the body with the insulin it needs. While type 2 diabetes (most often caused by obesity and lack of physical activity) can be treated with eating well, exercising, and maintaining a healthy weight, type 1 cannot. So type 1 diabetics must use insulin from another source. Originally this insulin came from animals, but synthetic insulin was developed in the early 1960s.

Since these breakthroughs, the methods for checking your blood glucose level and administering insulin has come a very long way. Continuous glucose monitors can be inserted under the skin and worn to collect a blood sugar reading every five minutes. Insulin pumps deliver insulin 24/7 to more closely mimic insulin administration of a working pancreas. However, the treatment of the disease is far from perfect. Due to miscalculations, a diabetic's blood sugar can easily reach less than ideal levels. Bodies develop bruises and knots from injections and pump sites. Fingers become calloused from years of blood glucose checking.

In order to raise money for type 1 diabetes research outreach, my amazing friends are embracing their bodies (pancreas included) for a 2015 calendar featuring tasteful nude photos of 13 vibrant models, all of whom have type one diabetes. Some have had it for the majority of their lives. All proceeds for this calendar are going to diabetes organizations. If you'd like to buy a calendar, or just find more info about the project, check out their website (but be warned, there are some racy photos on the site). Just google ""T1D Exposed"".

When I was thirteen, I was visiting my grandparents and passing a lot of time in the public library in their Portland, Oregon neighborhood.  My grandfather was very sick; the atmosphere in my grandparents apartment was tense and mournful, and I was happy to spend as many hours as possible out of the house. I'm a lazy reader and usually turn to familiar books to comfort myself when I'm feeling low, but most of the books I knew well had been checked out, so I found myself browsing through fantasy and science fiction titles for books I hadn't yet read.

I don't have a precise memory of coming across Ursula K. Le Guin's ""A Wizard of Earthsea,"" but I'm certain the endpaper maps of the Archipelago, the island-world of Earthsea, captured my attention right away (maps are endlessly seductive.)  I hoped, I think, that the story inside would be similar in mood and feeling to C.S. Lewis's Narnia books, or to ""The Hobbit."" 

What I found instead was very different:  there were certainly the trappings of adventure. ""A Wizard of Earthsea"" is a story of magic, and danger, of a young wizard who attends a school for spell casters, a terrible shadowy being, dragons, evil enchanters, and lots of sailing.  But it is also a story about pride and humility, about the precarious balance between human desires and the natural world.  And about being and not-being.  It unsettled and surprised me -- it was melancholy and strange, utterly memorable but elusive in the way that none of the other works of fantasy I had encountered were. 

I finished ""A Wizard of Earthsea"" within a couple of days, and immediately picked up ""The Tombs of Atuan,""  the story of a girl taken from her family and made the priestess of a deathly religion, and how she gains her freedom.  It was even shadowier and more troubling than the first book, and it stayed with me all the more after my grandfather died, during that same visit.

Since that time I've read more of Ursula Le Guin's fiction: all of the remaining Earthsea books (""The Farthest Shore,"" ""Tehanu"", ""The Other Wind"" and ""Tales of Earthsea"") as well as her books ""The Left Hand of Darkness"" and ""The Dispossessed,"" which are works of science fiction,  but which focus far more on people and their relationships -- and on ideas -- than on any of the usual themes and ideas one associates with SF.  It's difficult to describe the experience -- especially considered in total -- that reading Le Guin's work imparts, but anyone who's had an encounter with one or more of her books will know what I mean.

""The Left Hand of Darkness"" is a story about (among other things) about a people whose gender is not determinate, but which changes in response to their situation.  It was the first book that I ever read that offered me a glimpse of how constructed and totalizing our ideas about ""male"" and ""female"" are.  ""The Dispossessed"" is a similarly eye-opening treatment of ideas about freedom, property, and how we make our societies. 

Thisis hardly an exhaustive list of her books, but these are (perhaps) her most essential ones. Sometimes I think the only magic that could exist would have to be of the sort Le Guin has written into being.  If you haven't read any of her books, I hope you'll pick one up.  Write me if you do. Thanks for reading.

Isis (yes her name is Isis but she had it 3 years before the terrorists did) is four years old, and Xyana is two.  My wife and I are not related to them in any way shape or form. We have just had the great fortune of knowing them since Isis was 3 months old and Xyana's birth.  In my 45 years of life I have not experienced anything better than the pureness and perfection of a child.  Watching as they learn to walk and talk are great but it is the smaller things that really amaze me.  I especially remember the time I first noticed Isis, who knew how to count for quiet some time, learned that each marshmallow she counted was represented by an actual number.  Before that, any group of 5 things could have been counted as 3, 8 or even 10.  It was so cool to see her count 5 of them over and over, each represented by its own number.  She finally understood!  Once when Xyana had done something mean to Isis while we were driving somewhere, my wife was scolding her.  Her reply after a short time was “can you guys be quiet up there, I’m trying to sleep.  They used to spend the night 3 or 4 times a week but now live 10 hours away.  It is not easy to have phone conversations with small children but we manage (mostly due to my wife who is a better communicator than I).  It is extremely difficult to be separated from them.  It feels as if part of me is missing.  I have kept a journal of them since their birth.  It chronicles the things they have learned, the funny things they say and do, and things we have done and shared together.  It will be a gift to them one day.  I love reading through it.  Words paint a much better and clearer picture than a photo does.  It is nice to relive those times in my head.

Things I like (besides Isis and Xyana).Laughing, talk radio, Rice-A-Roni, pizza, Chinese food, potato’s in any form except raw, pie, macaroni and cheese, licorice, and my cholesterol and blood pressure medication.  Food is defiantly my drug of choice.

I am overweight by about 30 pounds.  Loosing weight is very hard for me.  I go up and down between 230 and 250.  I quit smoking 15 years ago and found it to be very easy to do so.  I have never had a craving.  Really, I never have.  But food is a whole other ballgame.

I hope one day to live close to my girls again so if anyone in or near the western part of Michigan’s upper peninsula needs a hard working honest man, please let me know.

My favorite emails are the ones that tell something about that persons life, the least are those that offer advice.  My favorites, in the order I received them have been from:

Here are ten ideas I try to practice as often as possible. I always believe we all have better days ahead of us.

1. Call your parents once a week and tell them you love them. If not your folks, call someone you love. Never underestimate the power of your voice expressing affection upon someone.

2. Live below your means and work to save at least 20% of your salary. Set up automatic withdrawals to a separate account. Maximize your retirement contributions. It is never to late to start saving and yes, every penny does count.

3. Little habits make all the difference in life: Stretch & Touch your toes in the shower every day. Brush your teeth. Put your fork down between bites.

4. Do something nice for someone once a day. The cumulative effect of random acts of kindness are worth striving towards.

5. Eat less meat, processed foods, and exercise more. Little changes will always add up.

6. Read more - just not on electronic devices. There’s beauty in focusing some time to shutting off all distractions and reading a book.

7. Music - Make more music, or listen to more Classical, Jazz, and ambient music. All great genres to help meditate.

8. Never stop learning: Learn something new every day. Read something different, draw something, cook something new.

9. Be Optimistic. Before you say or do something, think. Take your time, choose your words carefully, and always be optimistic. This time will never come again, make it count.

10. Save a life - adopt a pet. You may find that your pet may be the one saving your life.

Hope some of these ideals resonate with you all.

Miraculously enough I won. I am going to share with you a select few responses that my peers and I had!""Appreciate those around you, whether they are loved ones, friends or just acquaintances, and just for a moment, acknowledge what they mean to you.

""Everything that I could say and everything I should say has left my mind. I am lost in a sea of mediocre thoughts and yet I am still asked to talk to more people than I ever had before. I believe that this in itself can be a lesson to me and maybe to some of you. But it is interesting in the two different ways you may look at it. On one hand maybe I should have been more prepared, ready  to address this many people at once. So that I could been seen as intelligent, professional, and have my thoughts respected. Yet without this preparation the experience is entirely different. This frantic search to find something worthwhile to say. It makes me feel a rush of many different emotions, the excitement of being encountered by this new situation, the nervousness of failing, and the joy of having it finished. In the end it gives me a respect for words which I did not have before. A want to pick and choose every word with love and care."" - Connor S

""A world in which everyone loved themselves would make more room to love other people fully. Right now, most have negative views towards themselves and in turn project it onto others. If everyone could love themselves, we could spread so much more positivity. I think everyone would be happier."" -Kylie C

""We are trained to always be rushing to the next thing. Our schedules fill up too quickly and we end up having to pick what we have time for and what we don’t. Take a quick break from life.  Put down the smartphone and go someplace where there is no evidence of human civilization. Experience the beauty of something untouched by man.

November 2014,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/11/18/the-good-stuff/,"November 2014, 18",The Good Stuff,"Here’s the thing. I don’t know much, really, about anything. Still trying to figure so much out and I turned thirty this year, which felt big. I’ve always been in love with stories- on film, on TV, in books, music, photographs, canvas… I think our art showcases the best and worst in us and that always moves me. Beyond that there’s not much I can say for certain.

What I do know about is people. I’ll give you a couple reasons why.I’m the colour of a roasted peanut, ‘café con leche’ in Spain. My mother’s side of the fam is Jamaican. A few generations up our family tree is a slave who fell in love with a Scottish landowner who loved her right back, building a home on his land for them and their family. My father’s side is Puerto Rican and my grandmother insists there’s native Taino on her mother’s side while my grandfather was mostly of (the conquering) Spanish descent. The point is this- where we’re supposed to hate sometimes we love and pretty soon nature reclaims the building prejudice is housed in- the vines grow until the cement cracks and the glass disintegrates, leaving nothing but a frame for life to grow, take root, flower and bloom in.

My parents divorced soon after I learned to walk. They both remarried and divorced again- one was a peaceful negotiation, division and sharing of responsibilities and assets. The other was sprawling, vicious warfare that left a crater with an irradiated zone in the middle of my teenage years. Not an unusual story, just a painful one.I grew up in the USA during the summer with my father and Ireland for the rest of the year with my mother, visiting my grandmother on a hill in the Puerto Rican countryside or lingering over curry goat with my Jamaican grandmother and her church music in her house in Long Island, getting ready for the house to be filled with drinks and reggae when aunts, uncles and cousins came pouring in later.

What I’ve picked up from my family history past and present is how we’re all the same. We all seem to be recipes that require the same ingredients: home, safety, food, water, love… (music, books, movies and art I would argue too but that’s just me)Having had a front seat to three divorces I can also say that you love someone by listening without judgement, by accepting that everyone is just a person prone to mistakes- lover, parent, sibling or friend. Trying to be kind and trying to understand changes everything, for everyone.  It’s hard work because we’re all a work in progress. Sometimes I work in a library and I’ve seen how some people crave kindness like a person parched. There’s no reason it should be that way.

Anyway, after panicking about being picked, I thought I’d share this. Hope you all have enough to make life happy. Thanks for all the stories. Keep ‘em coming. Drop me a line and let me know what moves you.

For me, it’s playing music loud, a good book to hand and maybe a movie later. Cooking good food, loved ones and maybe the odd adventure. The sea. Sunshine. Forests. Mischief and silliness. Writing. Podcasts. You know- the good stuff. Everything else is gravy.

Be well :) xx

November 2014,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/11/16/tango/,"November 2014, 16",Tango!,"Dear fellow Listservians,

What a joy and honour to write to all of you today! (no pressure)l'll show you a glimpse of a deep life passion: traditional Argentine Tango.

At age 19 I heard Piazzolla's music for the first time. Tango, I was told. It was so beautiful that it brought me to tears. The thought of dancing to this touching music was extremely attractive - but hey, there's no point in starting to learn to dance when you're an adult, right? All this difficult, profound stuff like Ballet, Flamenco, Tango is an art and to make something out of that, you should begin at a very young age, when the body and the soul can still be moulded...

So for a long time, I thought that Tango was my Grand Missed Opportunity in life and that I - rooted in Northern Europe - should definitely reincarnate in Buenos Aires instead of in Holland next time ;-)

How wrong I was!

I had my first Tango lesson at age 34 and I dance for 7 years now. It is fantastic.

Argentine Tango originates at the Rio de La Plata (Buenos Aires, Montevideo) around 1900.

Although the appearance seems quite traditional, it is still a young dance and in constant development up till today. It's danced all over the world. However, it is also a kind of hidden sub culture and a secret community if you're not into it.

It's all based on walking-together and pure improvisation. Much more than steps, you learn about a system of movement and a posture, about stretching and relaxing your body (and your mind...) at the same time. About how to interpret music and rythm in a very personal way. You learn about a close embrace with a dance partner and about subtle communication through body language.

Tango is also and especially a social activity.

We go out to Milongas ('tango discos') and dance with different partners. Every joy, every sorrow and even every dull moment can be expressed in Tango. The music is carrying us through, when 20, 50 or 180 couples are sharing a dancefloor together and moving in lanes like on a highway, creating a common flow.

We are 20 or 80 years old. We dance together. We're female, male, hetero, gay, transgender and of any skin colour. Tall or petite, fast or slow, skinny or heavy. Full of energy or dreamy and easy -  wearing our best dresses or our favourite jeans.  You can be extrovert or introvert, macho or soft or both. We dance together. In an open or close embrace, sharing a heartbeat. We are the truth of ourselves when we dance.

In Tango there is always music, movement, oxytocine (a happy hormone) and the prettiest shoes you've ever seen. There are many friends and fellow dancers to meet, at local or exotic far-away Milongas. The dance is about connection, intimacy, awareness, physical contact and concentration, all immersed in music. There are many broken or healed hearts on the floor. The moment is ours, life is ours, again and again, dance after dance, night after night…

So if you like or need a plan B in life, put on a smile, look for Tango lessons and find your way to the Milongas. A truly fascinating world of music, dance and connection is there to be found!

For the picture: I'm female, Dutch, 40, divorced, a dedicated high school teacher, a student at university (again), a fanatic book reader and a happy Argentine Tango dancer.

I hope you're having a glorious day today :-)

Take care out there -

My name is Erin, I’m 33 years old, and originally from Kansas, USA. (Rock Chalk Jayhawk!) Despite the unfortunate current political landscape of my state, I have to say it was a pretty nice place to grow up and most definitely has the best sunsets of any place I’ve ever seen (no trees or hills has to be good for something, am I right?!).

Anyhow, now I live in Brooklyn, New York and currently work as a trauma therapist at a domestic violence agency.  Unfortunately, domestic violence continues to be an extremely prevalent social problem across all races and classes, and is not well understood in our society. In my clinical work, I am most interested in the complex, yet subtle ways that trauma is transmitted inter-generationally. I think that if we can better understand this dynamic on a larger scale it can help prevent future generations from repeating pain from the past. If you have any thoughts on this, I am all ears!

As a human being interacting with other human beings in this world, I have noticed that when we are suffering, feeling sadness, anger, or completely alone, even though it feels scary, it is often when we open up and make ourselves most vulnerable to express that pain to another that we find the deepest of human connections and healing. On the other hand, sometimes you just need to hide under the covers and watch reruns of Cheers (still so hilarious and has the best theme song ever) with a bottle of wine till it all starts to feel better. I think there is a balance somewhere...

Finally, I'd like to give a shout out to my friend Nichol, who introduced me to the Listserve, who is one of the best human beings I know, and who is a great friend. He is also an amazing writer and drink-orderer. I owe him about a bazillion rum punches.

As I’m a game developer by trade and a general creative-type, I figured what finer way than to develop a game. A few minutes ago, I did just that.Materials:

- stack of index cards (or multiple sheets of paper)

- pens/pencils (at least one for each player)

- players (4-8, probably)

Directions:

- each player should take a card and write down the name of a fictional person. leave lots of room, and pass it to their left.

- each player takes the card they receive and writes down a sentence or two of public knowledge about the name on the card, and passes it to their left.

- each player takes the card they receive, and writes down (on the back) a sentence or two of a deep dark secret involving the name on the card, and after folding it to hide the secret, passes to their left.

- the card you receive is now your identity for the remainder of the evening. Your goal is to uncover all the other players secrets, while hiding your own.

Tips:- the secret works best if it’s something that would ruin the character completely if it were to be revealed- intertwined secrets can be especially fun if it’s something that involves another character, and recall you’ve seen two names before you write the secret for the third- remember that at least one person knows your secret from the moment you start the game, because they wrote it down- get into character as much as you can. You’ll feel silly at first, but it’s WAY more fun.- it can be interesting to establish prior knowledge and setting before you start creating the cards, such as: all characters are trapped in a bomb shelter together; or they’re kids spending the night in a haunted mansion on a dare; or The Inspector won’t let anyone leave until he figures out who murdered The Victim

Have fun!

November 2014,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/11/13/ai/,"November 2014, 13",AI,"Even the very basic first steps into Artificial Intelligence fascinate me. From the weird unknown world of film where AI is perceived as something extraordinarily difficult to the very realistic use of if in our everyday life thought Siri or Google Now. At this moment I am taking a course in it at my local university and would like to tell you a little about what it is.

AI is the process of understanding of how people think on a fundamental level. Instead of trying to figure out how each individual neuron in your brain works, AI tries to generalized this by think computationally. An easy way of understanding this, is as The Wright Brothers, they didn't look at birds and try to model every single bone, muscle and feather; instead they tried to understand the general basic such as aerodynamics and how to get a similar effect using everyday materials.

Most of the time when you think you apply some kind of a computational scheme, for example if you are trying to find your car keys, you know that they are usually either in your pocket or on the table. So the next logical step would be to check your pocket, if you do not find anything then that means that they are on a table. This is done automatically by your brain without you realising most of the time. If we scale this problem up, to say going grocery shopping, then it become a lot more difficult: what products to buy, at which supermarket(better quality, closer location, cheaper prices), how to carry them home(on car or by foot, limiting the amount of groceries you are able to buy). This becomes such a complex task that we have to individually dedicate our time to thinking about this, it doesn't happen automatically(although sometime it does, such as a simple milk run). Most of what AI does is try to solve these similar problems using our modern computers. They have an input of the different variables and elements, such as possible groceries, possible stores, store information, etc; and then they calculate the most efficient and best way to shop. The more variables that are present the better the choice becomes but at the same time the more difficult it is to calculate. This kind of AI is used in many Voice recognition systems, they have a set amount of words and phrases that they know and then they try to listen for when you tell them one of them.

AI has an incredibly wide application in our modern world, it could be used to model efficient food transportation routes, it could provide the least congested city street using smart traffic lights, it could provide incredible realistic gaming scenarios and it already provide fairly good voice recognition.

This is just a little peek at what AI is, if you are interested read the book called 'Thinking as Computation' it covers the examples I have here as well as many others.

Now little about me, I am Pranoti, originally from India currently studying in Stuttgart, Germany.

Life lessons: Move to a different continent if you want to find the real you. It is super hard at the beginning but trust me, it gets better!Follow your dreams but always have a back up plan.To get through good or bad times, look in the mirror and smile. :)

Need your thoughts!I love my job but I want to start something on the side. Like selling paintings, making boxes. Your ideas are always welcome! 

I want to go backpacking and know nothing about me. Instead of reading blogs online I would like to know from You, your suggestions, tips, experiences! I start from scratch so tell me everything! :D

November 2014,10,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/11/10/a-lesson-in-futility-one-act-dramatization/,"November 2014, 10",A Lesson in Futility (One-Act Dramatization),"According to Handbags, the legendary (depending on who you ask) pub-quiz team, if you’re not sure what to write, just jot down ‘Frank Lampard’. I was tempted to go with that, and only that, but for a joke that six people would get, none of whom subscribe to this list, it seemed a waste. Instead, a pointless story!

Once upon a time (roughly five weeks ago), there was a little boy (34-year-old man) whose birthday was fast approaching. His mother, off in distant lands (like…40 minutes away), sent by post (texted) an inquiry regarding his wishes for celebrating the occasion.

“I will not have you sully the day with crass commercialism,” the boy insisted.

“Fine. You’re getting a gift card,” came the reply. He thought to protest, but after conferring with numerous moms, he learned the futility of asking for nothing.

“Look…maybe knit me a sweater? A tacky one, with red and white stripes? Maybe a Southampton (SECOND PLACE OMIGOSH) crest on the chest?”Silence followed.

When the day arrived, the boy met his family for a birthday meal (it was one heck of a brunch, with crepes and everything). Pleasantries were bandied about, birthday cards distributed, dessert munched (and immediately regretted (thighs, butts, the usual complaints)). Though the anticipation was great, the boy saved the card from his mother for last. The others were read quickly, and he was pleased to note that all had respected his wishes to make the day about quality time, not cheapened by thoughtless plastic ‘gifts’. Then, one card remained.

The boy looked to his mother, the sealed card in his trembling hands. She grinned. Not the sort of grin that says, “Today, we celebrate the anniversary of my son’s birth.” A grin that said, “Hey, remember that time you jokingly asked for a 32,256-piece jigsaw puzzle for Christmas, a puzzle so large that it comes with a handcart so you can transport it, a monstrosity so monstrous that you'd have to move into a larger house if you ever hope to assemble it, and then I totally bought it for you? Enjoy your card, sucker.”

Slowly, the boy slid a finger under the flap of the envelope, and gently pried the flap free of that glue strip thing, the one that tastes absolutely awful but is always there. He peered inside, not daring to actually remove the contents. A normal birthday card. But…inside the card…she wouldn’t…

The grin sharpened. “There. Go buy yourself some yarn and knit your own damn sweater”.

The boy, now in possession of a gift card good for up to $50 worth of yarn, needles and other knitting supplies from a specialty shop, fumed in his seat. He shot (figurative) daggers from his eyes into the leftover crumbs of his quiche. “She will not get the better of me…not on my birthday.”

So…uh…yeah. Now I knit. Because I can call a bluff, too. Granted, I’m starting with a scarf, because a custom sweater probably isn’t the most encouraging way to start the hobby. You know what makes watching a Cincinnati Bengals game less stressful? Dealing with the agony of finding a missed stitch from eight rows ago, that’s what. Dalton keeps passing to defenders? Whatever, I just found some twisted loops that are going to cost me 20 minutes. I spent the earlier part of this evening figuring out how to tink and frog. Decided on a full-on frog, removing an entire white stripe from a Saints (SERIOUSLY…SECOND) classic design, and almost ruined two Sundays’ work. There will be a scar on the edge.

Fact: My mom is hilarious

In reference to Anathema's song ""Shroud of False"" which begins with "" We are just a moment in time"".It's just a moment, we are just a moment, and you are just a moment in Time, so make it a happy moment :)

Whenever I wish a happy birthday to someone, I wish him/her plenty of ""happy moments"", they can be minutes and they can be seconds, but they are happy, you feel you are happy during these moments, you should cherrish them. They are really important in making your day a better day, your week a better week and your life a better one :)

Listen to your favourite songs often, and Share them with someone you like.Dance with people you don't even know and feel that you communicate somehow with your moves. It's strange and funny at the same time :DEat your favourite dishes often, eat chocolate daily, drink your favourite beer often!Watch a movie you like a lot and that you didn't watch for a long time!Help each other! Be there when someone needs you! Feel as if you were in his/her position! Make a change whatever slight change it can be, but make things different!Enjoy your days to the fullest, and surround yourself with people you love, with people to whom you do matter, with people that can make you happy!Make efforts to reach your goals, sacrifice is worth it when you would like to achieve something! REALLY WORTH IT!! You would feel so grateful to yourself and so thrilled for having made something important!Be grateful to people! Be thankful to life!Speak your mind and tell things as they are in your mind, be natural spontaneous!If ever someone bothers you by saying something he/she shouldn't have said, don't pay attention, skip it and think of something else. Not worth it!Listen to music very often, music is important, music is beautiful, and music is eloquent! Music can trenscend your soul and your body! Music is powerful!!

Life is not about having or possessing things, it's about being someone and leaving a trace for the others.

These are not pieces of advice but these are the things I tell myself very often in order to become a better version of myself.

You are maybe telling yourself that I am a happy girl and that I don't have problems.FALSE! We all do have our problems but life is too short to focus only on the negative!

Thank you Cyrine namouri for letting me know about LISTSERVE :D You are an awesome woman, you are a fabulous and true friend and you are a beautiful human being :) <3

Just to finish; I am from Tunisia :) My name is Cheima or Sheima which means virtue.

Talking about Time, moments and days, listen to Explosions in The Sky- Remember me as a time of Day. It's really beautiful :)

Oh and one last thing: Try to travel as much as you can afford to, you don't know how much impact seeing people from different backgrounds can have on your soul! I mean like deep impact on you as a human being! And come to Tunisia if ever you travel :D

Drop me an email where you tell me your notion of happiness in one word or one sentence :D I would be happy to answer, and to read it!

See ya :D somewhere, somehow ..

My name is Holly and I’m a sophomore at Sweet Briar College in Virginia (USA), but I’m originally from Western Massachusetts. First things first, if you’ve never thought about a women’s college-do it! I wasn’t looking for one but I fell in love with SBC the second I stepped on campus. If you’re interested email me, I work in admissions!

This past weekend I had my heart broken. Last year I got a grant to go do mission work and research in Burkina Faso over winter break 2015 but with everything going on over there it isn’t looking good. Ever since my school participated in Operation Christmas Child when I was in 5th grade I’ve been in love with the country. Maybe it’s selfish, but I am so angry that this is going on RIGHT NOW. Ugh, maybe things will get better by January, I’ll take any prayers and crossed fingers!

I want to be a clinical psychologist when I “grow up”. Any tips on getting into a PhD program? I’m nervous already. I’m sort of a perfectionist but I’m afraid I won’t get in anywhere, even though I still have time.

I LOVE dance. I’ve done ballet since I was five, I’ll never be a professional but I love everything about it. I’m actually writing a paper on the origins of ballet right now. If you love it as much as I do, let’s talk! Any and every type of dance interests me.  Tell me your stories, your memories of dancing; ballet, folk dancing, dancing around your living room. There is nothing I am more passionate about than dance.

I’m definitely a feminist but Cinderella is my favorite. Is anyone else in love with Disney? Also I love watching Disney World proposals on youtube J

I’m studying abroad in Sevilla next year and I’m so excited! Any tips or must dos? Also, has anyone raised bilingual children? I’m interested in language acquisition from a psychological perspective and would love to hear stories. Does anyone know any psychology professors at La Universidad de Sevilla? I’d love to work in a lab when I’m over there.

PSA: College age boys/men: I’m not the only one frustrated with this whole “talking” garbage, right? I want to go on dates (I don’t mind splitting the bill!!) and dress up for someone. I feel like both cell phone technology and hook-up culture has destroyed dating. I don’t want to be expected to be constantly texting someone one, I have things to do during the week. I am in such a relationship rut and I can’t seem to do anything about it. Wanna go back to when dating was a thing? Please tell me I’m not the only one!

Names! I love them. If you had to name a baby boy and girl right now, what would you name them? Why? What are your favorite names? Do you like your name? I’m currently in love with Hypatia Pearl and Tucker Atlas.

I ran my first half marathon in October. 1.5 years ago I couldn’t run a mile. I promise you can do anything and everything!!

I think Carrie Underwood and Sam Hunt are perfection.

If any of this interests you I’d love to talk!

Stay Beautiful!!

Love and Lollies,

November 2014,07,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/11/07/pondering-paradoxes/,"November 2014, 07",Pondering paradoxes,"Initial excitement slowly dissipated into agony over what I, an 18-year-old college student, could possibly contribute to your life. As the generous 48-hour period faded, disparate ideas tumbled in my mind, colliding but never forming coherent connections - until I realized the purpose of this golden 48-hour opportunity is not to be didactic, but to offer my organic approach to life.

Annual traditions. Weekly obligations. The daily commute to work. All quite common occurrences at throughout my 18 years. Yet what keeps these seemingly repetitive events from being stale, boring, and taken for granted is that each time the calender rolls around, they have served as checkpoints for my intellectual, spiritual, and emotional growth. We often value the last concert, or last meal with a friend, as moments to reflect, but what about all the intermediate experiences that could serve even more nuanced purposes and affect how we continue to see these experiences?

Many indelible memories and experiences point to a certain paradox that I’ve gained a deeper understanding of every year: repetition of similar events illuminates contrast and change.

1. Harmonizing with friends while we wait for the train; peering behind heavy, velvet curtains before a concert - both mellow but blissful details of my friendship with choir friends. Perhaps the most meaningful memories are the repeated ones: singing on the same concert stage, in the same dress, with the same people, provides opportunity to consider what HAS changed and highlights how I have developed a deeper friendship with these people, more love for my choir, and more appreciation for music.

2. Peeling a fleshy Costa Rican mango, feeling the warm juice trickle down my cheeks and leave sticky squiggles on my face as I crinkle my nose and sink into my chair after a long day of building and teaching - every high-schooler at my Christian high school embarks on a service trip every spring, where where year after year, we cultivate a deeper, more Christ-like mentality for service. As we served others until exhaustion, we became more sensitized to not our own contribution, but the sacrificial acts of those teachers who taught us that service is valuable, even if our sacrifices go unrecognized.

3. As I walk down the now all-too-familiar quad of my college, I suddenly considered the drastic difference between the girl who stood there five months ago, super uncertain about whether to commit to the school, and the girl who now uses the contrast between that uncertainty and her present love for the school to deeply appreciate the introspection she underwent to arrive at the best decision she’s made thus far in her life. I pull out a voice recording from when I visited the college five months ago, my indecisive voice sounding so foreign because of the many heartbreaking and heartwarming events that occurred between the voice of the girl I hear through my phone and the voice of the girl who now is able to tell others confidently where God wants her to be for the next four years. And every time I walk through this quad, I’m reminded of His provision and guidance - reminders I’ll relive every time I walk through this quad and promises I’ll need to hold onto tenaciously for future moments of uncertainty and struggle.

From formal events such as returning to the same concert stage, to overlooked events such as walking down a certain road, many experiences have the potential to illuminate the contrast between our former and present selves and highlight our growth in ways both tangible and intangible.

May you revel in the fulfilling satisfaction of expanding your mind to understand yourself deeper, and expanding your soul to find deeper joy in treating every moment as a transformative privilege.

What have been meaningful repetitions in your life?

On a completely unrelated note, I’ve started a project assessing the correlation between one’s gender, age, ethnicity, and Love Language preference, and you lovely Listservians are the perfect audience to address! If you’d like to partake in this study, just email me, I’ll email the survey and the results to everyone who indicates interest.

November 2014,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/11/06/how-life-happened-for-me/,"November 2014, 06",How Life Happened For Me,"One of the best pieces of advice that ever jumped off the page for me: Let go of your personal history.

At first it seemed like a tough pill to swallow: wait! what? where are you going with that? I earned that, dammit.

But it was only in that moment when I realized that the very things, all along, I would’ve liked to have done without, I clung to like a badge of honor.

So which one was it? Do I want it, or not.

Could I really be me without some of those very hurtful, harmful and even horrifying things?

I spent much of my life trying to make “victim” cool or chic. It’s what I was. The cards I was dealt, so why not make the best of ‘em, right?

With some special mental calculator, I had worked out the math: the world owed me. And I was willing to wait. And wait.

I was jaded, and perhaps rightfully so. I’d been the sole witness to my mother’s murder. I was only in kindergarten when I testified against my father. Even after his conviction, he continued to deny what I’d seen with my own two eyes. I was eight when he finally led authorities to her body and came clean of his crime. We had all only just begun to move on.

And move on we did, eventually. But not without the scars that color your attitude, your relationships, your perspective.

It had its upsides; I won’t lie. I grew up with my grandmother, which as you can imagine, was a lot of dessert. In high school I was fun and popular, but I could also get down with the dark emo kids, writing poetry, and cutting in the closet after school. Self medication was a big plus; I made a sport of it. Winning on all accounts.

But the Bandaids never stayed put. The gaping wounds never sealed. They still oozed anger and resentment and tears of aching grief.

I was thirty when I read those words: Let go of your personal history. Years of relationships tainted by mistrust, jealousy and fear of abandonment proved that there was absolutely nothing chic about playing victim.

I was ready to let go. To accept. To be grateful even.

No longer did I believe that all this had happened to me. I finally understood that it had happened for me.

They were my cards, yes, but whose to say whether they were good or bad. They just were.

And looking back, I’m pretty darn proud of how I played them. Even in ignorance, I did my best.

That was six years ago now, when I let go. No meltdowns since or need for self medication. I kid you not, I have yet to have a bad day since. I have my moments, yes. Those triggers still hit when I want to spill my guts say one more time to justify those feelings I’m no stranger to, but I don’t. I won’t.

It’s just a story. I remind myself. It’s just a useless story.

Besides, I’m too busy these days trying to figure out just what it is I owe the world.

In gratitude,

kat hurley

Everything depends on this: it is the only question. So as not to be conquered by the conquered territory in which you lead your life, so as not to feel the horrible weight of inertia wrecking your will and bending you to the ground, so as not to spend a single night more wondering what there is to do or how to connect with your neighbors and countrymen, you must make secret plans without respite. Plan for adventure, plan for pleasure, plan do pandemonium, as you wish; but plan, lay plans constantly. 

And when you come to, on the steps of the presidential palace, in the green grass beside the highway, in your cell's gloomy solitude, your secret plan finished or foiled, ask your comrades, as your cellmates, ask the wind, the waves, the stars, the sea, ask everything that ponders, everything that wanders, everything that sings, everything that stings- ask them what time it is; and your comrades, your cellmates, the wind, the waves, the stars, the sea all will answer: ""It is time for a new secret plan. So as not to be the martyred slave of routine, plan adventure, plan pleasure, plan pandemonium, as you wish; but plan, plan secretly and without respite."" *

The Goat Farm is an experimental hybrid business model inspired by economic/innovation theories of population density and diversity of disciplines. This place is a magical nugget in the middle of a blooming metropolitan city.

We are a for profit arts center with a model designed to attract a dense collection of forward-thinking ventures. We recognize that consistent vanguard arts programming creates a progressive “Center of Gravity” brand for many of Atlanta's thought leaders and their ventures. We have a myriad of tenants -- ranging from a nanotechnology lab, blacksmith shop, cloud/mobile application architecture developers, fashion designers, industrial product designers, engineers, game theorists, architects, non-profits, and much more. We also produce nearly 150 programs annually in classical & contemporary music, traditional and experimental theater, film screenings, literary programs, contemporary dance,  contemporary performance, art exhibitions, workshops, seminars & panel discussions.

We believe that pattern-breaking leads to new thinking and new thinking leads to unorthodox problem solving. Interacting with other creatives outside of your discipline can catalyze pattern-breaking and get you looking in new directions.

We have current goals to create density and revitalize the underused parts of downtown without causing harmful displacement and gentrification.  We aspire for idea capital to stay in Atlanta.

And we're not the only ones championing this city! Atlanta is an intricate fabric threaded with a colorful culture full of top universities, civic innovation, creative start-ups, and fried food. Google Andre 3000's recent interview on NPR's Fresh Air about Outkast's roots and how you can get away with things in Atlanta/the South that you couldn't elsewhere.

Ok, maybe I have had almost 3 years to prepare for this but still, what the hell do I write?!I can't write amazing emails like the other people, my gramm,,a;*r and my $ρ€ℓℓɨɲǥ is horrifying. I'm a pretty uninteresting 22 year old white brit!

Sometimes when I would get the Listserve I would think to myself what I would write if I was chosen and the answer to this question has been changing. If I was chosen back when I signed up I would have written about how horrible it was being unemployed, how my entry into the adult world was rather miserable, how horrible it felt to be constantly rejected by company’s and struggling to see where you might be in a few years.A few months later if I was chosen I would have written about finally getting a job, albeit a temporary one, how things were finally looking up somewhat.Fast forward a year and I would have probably written something pretty similar about yet again having a temporary job with an end date rapidly approaching and knowing unemployment was about the return again.

They would have been pretty depressing and miserable Listserves to say the least, you guys are lucky.

A few months later I would have written a pretty positive email about how I was finally going to wake up and get moving. Literally. How I was determined to get a job and also to lose weight.8 months later I would have written a pretty classic Listserve email that’s super positive and happy, talking about the fact that finally being In a permanent job was such a relief and also how I had managed to go from obese to ""healthy weight"" in less than a year by losing 150 pounds.Now almost 12 months later I’m writing this. Time is pretty funny, a lot can change in a really short amount of time, or very little can. I'm still in that job, it's not great but it's a job and I'm happy. Work is crap, but people are good (I promise I’m not a caveman). Things could be better, but things could be worse and you need to fight for happiness sometimes. Life is unpredictable, which is very much a blessing and a curse. Wait a second, am I writing a Listserve about time?! What is this? Doctor Who? Life is a blessing and a curse?! What? You're not writing a screenplay here.But back to the main issue,what on earth am I meant to write in my Listserve? Wait a second, I got this. How about writing my Listserve about not knowing what to write in my Listserve?

How beautifully meta.

October 2014,31,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/10/31/swans-and-other-stories/,"October 2014, 31",swans and other stories,"Once I saw a swan crash land onto/into the road in Dublin. It was along the quays and the Liffey was very high and black, and hey, it was an easy mistake to make, man. It tumbled and stood up, seemingly unharmed, and then strutted in the middle of the road, hissing at anyone who thought there might be something funny about the situation. Swan was not happy. A man got out of his car and attempted to herd it out of the road. Swan was having none of it. And then, man just got behind swan, picked swan up and flung swan over the wall into the river. I cried with laughter. Just a regular Thursday morning in Dublin. Later that night I saw David O' Doherty do his comedy thing. He mentioned swans enough (twice) in his act that I thought this would be a Great and Amazing story to tell him as he signed a CD for my friend far away (Hi Hannah!). It was not. Rapid word vomit, still cringing.

I live in Edinburgh now. Trying to weasel my way into the book world. In fact, I have a feeling somehow that I found the listserve through Neil Gaiman, maybe he mentioned it in his blog. Thanks Neil. You'd do a better job of writing this. If you're a fan of his or even if you're not you should go see him in Tasmania this January. Hobart is great. MONA is great. MOFO is also pretty great but getting real expensive. Even if I still lived there I couldn't afford to go. Also if you live in Tassie you should check out my friend's bands -The Dead Maggies and Mouldy Porpoise, because they are great and so is she and I miss her.

the toast is the best thing on the internet and Mallory Ortberg is a goddess.

My sisters are amazing. They are much cooler and infinitely more fabulous than me. They'd definitely also call me a sap for writing that.

this stream of consciousness has been brought to you by tiredness

Charlie Byrne's in Galway is a helluva bookshop.

I put sriracha on everything. But especially eggs. It's a delicious treat, swearsies.

October 2014,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/10/29/my-social-anxiety/,"October 2014, 29",My social anxiety,"I suffer from moderate to severe social anxiety along with waves of severe depression. I try not to allow my mental illness define me, but I do not hide it from those around me, since it is a part of who I am. I can almost remember the day when I stopped wanting to go to stores or visit friends. Don’t get me wrong, I was never the most social kid. Yet, before I was 19, I had a few friends and went out on Friday nights. Then one summer, I stopped calling people and began to be content being within the four walls of my home. There was nothing that had happened, there was no traumatic incident. The outside world suddenly became scary and unknown.

Now, some years later, I am a university student trying to make my way out of school. My boyfriend is working very hard to convince me that I deserve to think of myself as an equal to my peers and deserve to be treated as such. University was not what I expected. I have to spend a lot more time arguing with professors then I thought I would. I have been granted accommodations from the university, such as a quiet room to write exams, but a lot of my professors seem to think these accommodations are not necessary. I am often told that my illness is inconvenient. I know, but I am trying to convince them (and myself) that I am worth it.

I would just like to thank those who helped me when I didn't think I deserved it. People like my boyfriend, and my current close friends, are the reason I am  alive today. Though everyday, I still need to make the choice to get out of bed and it still takes all the energy that I have, I am glad I am around to make that decision.

Under this context, do you think our society would look magical and god-like to someone from 1764? Consider the evidence:- We can communicate instantly with anybody around the world (cell phones)- We can learn (almost) anything from home (Internet)- We can get from one place to another in the world quickly and safely- We can carry most of our wealth with us and make transactions everywhere (credit cards)- We have instant access to (almost) every piece of art, entertainment and debate (Internet again)- Many other things: Microwaves, online translation, wireless everything, flying cars (ok, maybe not!)

If you think its possible we look a little god-like to our time-traveller, let me ask you the next question: Do you feel like a god? Why not?

Maybe we are at a great moment in human history but are too busy trying to make sense of the noise to appreciate it.

PS: If you ever wondered how to survive were you to be transported more than 230 years into the past (and who doesn't) my answer would be: invent the hot air balloon. It's probably the simplest and most useful piece of technology not invented by then.

Sometimes, I feel my life is not as exciting as I thought it would be when I was 12. I try to mitigate that feeling by going on little adventures with calculated risks.

With your suggestions, I'd like to make a bucket list of uncommon, odd, curious spots for myself to visit, one day. Of course, the best ones are free.

Send me a quick note with an idea of what I could put on my list.If you've already been to your singular point of interest, took a picture and feel like sharing it with the rest of the pack, please do so! Use the hashtag #SophiesWorldWonders on Instagram. Don't forget to let us know where it is.

Here are some examples... As you can see, it doesn't have to be super fancy:

- I took the picture I posted on Instagram this week. It's a historic sign in New Hampshire, off route 3 near Lincoln, about ""The Betty and Barney Hill Incident"". It's funny because it's super official, but the sign talks about how Betty and Barney have been abducted by aliens.

- In Montreal, there's a place on Ste Catherine street where the Princess Theater used to be. The Great Houdini got punched in the belly there, backstage, by a McGill student, and died a couple of days later of a ruptured appendix. The building is gone, but someone draw a Houdini graffiti in the alley. Most Montrealers don't know about how one of them killed a legend.

- In London, UK, off the Strand, on the side of a building, you can see a Roman bath through the basement window. There's an outside switch to turn the light on. That's it. A peek of a Roman bath through a dirty window full of algae. With a light switch.

- On the island of Brac, in Croatia, a pine tree is growing on the roof of a chapel.

- There's a half-day hike in the Appalachians called ""Indian Head"". The view on top is stunning. When you get back, stop by the waterfall to pretend you are in Jurassic Park.

Thanks in advance.

They say we should gradually surrender the things of our youth as we age but I can’t help but rail against that notion as I see her struggling to feed herself, to even say hello.

A relic of the past, she stares at me with wide eyes.

With so much wisdom and experience contained in one person, I ask the question I had been meaning to ask for a while now. She had been married to my Grandfather for over 50 years until he passed.

‘What’s the key to a successful marriage?’

Unable to name her brothers and sisters just a few moments before, I expect a confused, disjointed response.

She turns her attention to me with a hawk-like focus and steely states ‘Listen to each other. Always listen to each other.’

In a moment, like the conversation had never happened, she’s back wondering what’s for dinner that night.

I’m thankful I listened._____________________________________

In six months I’ll be walking down the aisle to my best friend.

If you’re married, engaged, in a relationship, or single, I would be more than honored to hear what you have to say about what you believe creates a successful marriage.

For our wedding, I will incorporate your advice at our wedding tables- featuring your first name and your location.

I’m grateful for your time and for your unique insight!

We look forward to hearing from you!

I can’t speak for every 18-year-old on the planet, but I think this is a funny age. You are just old enough to know how young you really are, you are full of idealistic thoughts that you sheepishly acknowledge as maybe just a bit too idealistic. You still feel like a child parading in adult’s clothing. You recognize that you probably don’t know all that much.

So here’s my question for the community - what did you wish you could tell yourself when you were 18? It can be life advice. It can be a story. It can be a baking recipe.

I don’t know all that much, but I’d like to learn.

October 2014,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/10/24/hello-gorgeous/,"October 2014, 24",Hello GORGEOUS!,"What is UP Listserver's?!

I live in NYC, so I will keep this brief and to the point.  I understand that time is money, and Your time is valuable.  What do You do with this precious commodity? I was once on an interview and that was the only real ""interview"" question I was asked, he said ""What can you say is your biggest accomplishment in your 25 years of life?""  I sat there, and millions of answers rushed to my head and raced to the tip of my tongue, and before I could reason with myself and give a million dollar answer, I replied ""helping people"".

I didn't always believe this, and it wasn't until I was 18 and had tried to fill a void in my soul with too many pointless things, and failed.  My life drastically changed for the better when I realised that it was not a ""what"" that could fill my void, but a ""who"".

Instead of going to college when I graduated highschool, I took an opportunity to travel the world.  I joined an organization that sent me to Africa, Southeast Asia, South America, and live in Perth, Australia for 2 years. I did all of this traveling, while [most] everyone else my age was in college partying, for 4 years.  I'm not saying I am better than them, if I had been at college I would have definitely been a beer pong queen [I now blame my lacking skills in this game on this fact].  Out of all the beautiful places I lived in and visited, the highlight is the people I met and hopefully helped.  I could have been living a comfortable life in the Tri-State Area, but instead I was able to see how majority of the world lives ; with not enough food or clean water, sleeping on garbage heaps in slums, etc. etc.  Seeing and experiencing different cultures popped my New Jersey bubble, and opened my eyes to how vast this world is, how invaluable people are.

The greatest accomplishment I have in my 25 years of life, started the moment I became a real Christian and actually started living for others and not just myself . The ""who"" was Jesus Christ, and my void began to not seem so hopeless anymore, the million dollar question finally seeming to have an answer, I had found hope. That same opportunity is available for You as well.

See, I truly believe that You, AMAZING You, were made for a specific purpose and unique design; and until You figure out what that is, or at least skim the surface, You will feel that void.  You know what I'm talking about, that inexplicable void; that part of You that no amount of money or drugs or relationships, even.. coffee [gasp], will ever fill.  So what are You waiting for, answer the question for yourself.  If You don't like what You come up with, change it. And if you change it several times, and still don't like it, email me and I'll help. ;D

4 practical applications after reading this:

1] Find Your purpose in this life, help people, put others before Your own desires, look up Youth With A Mission [YWAM] it's the incredible organization I called home for 4 years.

2] Look up Hillsong Church, their music is incredible! I am going to the conference tonight in Madison Square Garden #NoOtherName, #hoLLA.

3] Take the ""Now, Discover Your Strengths"" assessment.  Buy the book, take the quiz online, just take it!! Focus on Your strengths, and not Your weaknesses, and email me Your results! My first strength is ""Positivity"", I will definitely be able to help You get enthusiastic about Your results.

4] Find an Esthetician and get a facial!

It’s a true story. Maybe. But more importantly, I hope it grabbed your attention or made you laugh. This timeless joke reminds me of an old school Mark Twain quote:

“Life is short, break the rules, forgive quickly, kiss slowly, love truly, laugh uncontrollably, and never regret anything that made you smile.”

I think there’s more to the quote, but you get the gist of it. Life is too short. If you can’t find something to laugh about every day, try harder. It’s out there. Don't take things so seriously. There's more to life than work. Find a healthy balance, and spend more time with your friends and family, and laugh with them. Uncontrollably. That's what ultimately matters in the long haul.

Shoot me an email back describing something that makes you laugh everyday and how you find a healthy work/life balance. Mine is slipping and could use some fresh new perspective and ideas. Or just say hello and where you're from. Would love to hear from you.

Today at work (in a restaurant) I had a guest with a coupon for two free meals. She was by herself and asked if the other free meal could ""go to the next person who looks like they could use it"".

It's little things. Little things like a free meal, holding the door, smiling at a stranger that make the biggest difference. There's so much wrong in this world. So much scary out there that sometimes we've become so guarded that we forget that were not the only thing that matters.

It doesn't matter that you're a successful business man, or a single mother, or homeless. We all need to be there for each other or else what is our life worth?

So I challenge you. All of you. Do something nice. Pay for the next cars order, smile, have fun, be nice, and for God's sake tip your bartender.

Hoping for many replies with wonderful deeds.

Hello all,

I don't want to rub it in too much but I WON! I'm thrilled to be writing to you all today and considering the amount of people on Listserve, I never dreamed to win. Consequently, I don't have anything prepared so off the top of my head here we go!

I consider myself lucky, I was born in the US whereas my parents emigrated here from the Philippines and have all the luxuries they dreamed of having as children. I appreciate their hard work and their tenacity to provide a better future for their children. On a visit I recently had, I saw where they grew up, a family of ten in each side of my family growing up in houses smaller than the one I live in now, poorly paved roads where they walked miles to school to educate themselves and the general poverty of the area; it was humbling. One thing however they weren't lacking in was their spirit. Everywhere I went, I saw happy faces and laughter teems of children running around having a blast. I happily joined in and it was one of the best times of my life, I can see why, despite growing up in that state, they remain so happy and communal. On random trips, to various places, my mom will somehow find the one Filipino person besides us and they get along like they've known each other all their lives. It encouraged me to reach out and make friends of my own in a similar manner in the college club I'm in, Circle K.

Circle K, (also a gas station/convenience store here in the US. No affiliation) is a volunteer/social club that's very active here in the US and other countries worldwide. Its a great place to meet people and as a college student, a way to help out your community in your free time. I helped out on various projects county wide from Habitat for Humanity, CicLaVia (A great bike day if you're ever in LA, they take major streets and close them down except for bike traffic, it's awesome but I digress) Make a Wish foundation, and other charities. I met wonderful people, lifelong friends and I got to participate in once in a lifetime events. I held the rope for the hand for a giant inflatable Elmo during the Hollywood Christmas parade, I got to meet future Mayor of LA Eric Garcetti at a Hollywood fundraiser event we volunteered at, and we seem to turn up in places that other people normally can't get into. It is a blast and I do encourage the college bound of you and the college...umm...already in college people to join Circle K or some form of community service. It's all sorts of awesome.

Living in LA is also awesome, in the aforementioned paragraphs, (wow this is actually getting quite long) I get to go to places and experience great things. LA has a somewhat bad reputation of smog, crime and traffic, but you get past that, then you have a plethora of things to do, Chantry Falls is a great hiking trip with a natural rock slide, Downtown Pasadena a foodies delight. Hollywood and Highland for the shopping, Hollywood Walk of Fame and Graumans Chinese Theater. You also have miles upon miles of beaches to visit, each one with it's own culture and ambiance. If any of you ever visit LA, contact me and I'll set you up with a personalized list of places to visit. (I'm a massive foodie, I've gone to tons of food places here)

As is with Listserve tradition, I'll leave with a quote,

""Beauty that dies the soonest has the longest life. Because it cannot keep itself for a day we keep it in our hearts. Because it can have existence only in memory, we give it immortality there""

I hope this all finds you well and if you Google my name, you kinda just find me. So feel free to drop me a line.

It's never a bad time to be reminded that people (and the things we make) are awesome, and that we live on/with an ornately fabulous planet, right?  

Never underestimate the power of going for a walk. Don't forget to look around, the details in the everyday can be the most surprising. As Ed Hutchins once said, ""nothing never happens"".

Travel. I especially recommend Oaxaca, Mexico for it's astounding botanical, cultural, ethnic, and culinary diversity. When you can't travel you can explore the world vicariously with Fun for Louis (on youtube).

For a master course in the wonder of the everyday (with a focus on the built environment), listen to 99% Invisible. For a similarly masterful treatment of everyday humanity, try 'Death, Sex, and Money'. These podcasts have managed to make my commute something I look forward to. 

If you are the kind of person who can read while traveling (unlike me) and you love great science writing (like me), here are some books I love and revisit: Bonk -- Mary Roach, The Ghost Map -- Steven Johnson, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks -- Rebecca Skloot, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat -- Oliver Sacks. I also LOVE The History of the World in 100 Objects by director of the British Museum Neil MacGregor -- it has short chapters, great pictures, and I learned so much. Who knew that the Vikings had trading posts in Iran!?! 

Making things yourself is another great invigorator. I like to paint, but cooking/eating is what I do (and think about) every day. Here are some delicious, simple, seasonal favorites: delicata squash (it tastes like candy! you can eat the skin!), Marcella Hazan's Chickpea soup (4 cheap ingredients, vegan, deeply warming and hearty), and pickled beets (a great entry-level pickling project, try roasting first for extra sweetness). 

Last, a potpourri of click-ables that reliably lift me out of low points: The Secret of Kells, Brene Brown's first TED talk, Paul Simon's Concert in the Park (1991), Talking Heads (Sand in the Vaseline), Allen Toussaint (Songbook), The National (Boxer, Trouble Will Find Me), Cat Power (Jukebox), Solange (True), Flight of the Conchords ('I'm not crying', 'Feel Inside'), bzzzpeekDOTcom (kids from around the world answer questions like 'what does a frog say?'), thingsfittingperfectlyintothings.tumblr.

October 2014,17,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/10/17/do-we-really-need-gender/,"October 2014, 17",Do we really need gender?,"A school-teacher friend recently asked me what issue I thought would be most transformative for future generations, and I didn’t hesitate before answering. As much as I want young people to get a grasp on climate change or income inequality, I think the biggest generational shift already underway has to do with our concept of gender. And that’s a wonderful thing.

As awareness of transgendered individuals grows, the rigid idea of gender as unchangeable and defined by one’s genitals is quickly collapsing. The speed that public opinion on LGBTQ issues is changing also shows that young people are much more accepting towards diverse gender identities and expressions.

But in the adult world, we’re far from gender equality. In the U.S., only in the past hundred years have women begun to achieve the same legal rights as men (though due to gender discrimination, they’re still highly underrepresented at the highest levels of politics and business, and even in the same careers, they only earn 78 cents for every dollar earned by men).

So I ask you to think critically when you make gendered assumptions, and question why we cling to this male/female division. At a deeper level, do we really need words like “man” and “woman”? If men and women can truly achieve whatever they want—follow any passion in their personal life or career—then what is the purpose of identifying someone's gender by calling them “he” or “she”? What vital information do these words tell us, beyond describing certain sex organs?

Up through the present, gendered language has enforced restrictive guidelines for how people should live their lives. Visit the aisles of any major toy store, and you’ll notice boys’ and girls’ toys are sharply divided: Girls can have pink, housework, and the arts; boys get cars, sports, and science. Social norms may be changing, but profit motives are not.

Some argue that language doesn’t affect reality, but studies have repeatedly shown that female-gendered words create a negative bias—from the usernames on comment threads to those at the tops of resumes. Calling a someone a ""girl"" isn't just about pointing out her vagina, but about grouping her into a class of people assumed to share personality traits and life paths. And in America, by and large, those traits are deemed lesser.

What is gender if not the most acceptable form of stereotyping? Perhaps in our lifetimes we will adopt a new neutral term to refer to individuals (as Swedish preschools have begun to do), or simply start using the more equitable “they.”

Until then, some thoughts for you to ponder: Why must we know a baby’s gender even before it is born? Why do we let advertisers tell our children what toys each gender can play with? Why is the U.S. one of the few developed countries without paid parental leave? Why aren’t all bathrooms gender-neutral? Why does the idea of taking a woman’s last name make most men angry? Why are laws restricting the reproductive rights of women mostly enacted by men?

Be kind to one another, and please VOTE on November 4th.

October 2014,15,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/10/15/about-streets-poetry-and-mathematics/,"October 2014, 15","About streets, poetry and mathematics","Hi everybody,

Last Thursday, Patrick Modiano received the Nobel Prize for Literature, but I would like to talk about another french writer whose work fascinates me: Jacques Roubaud. Mathematician, member of the Oulipo, he devoted his life to the study and production of poetry, he composed only by walking, without taking notes, memorizing the verses until he could write them down. ""The Great Fire of London"" is his masterpiece, he describes a mysterious ""project"" partly autobiographical, on a light tone, often funny and moving, in a complex structure full of Oulipian constraints. He manages to make us guess what may be the depth of literature, poetry and mathematics by organizing his knowledge and feelings in a story with ""interpolations"" and ""bifurcations"". If you love the game of go, the Grail cycle, troubadours, Japan, memory theories, libraries or literary games you should like these books. The first three «branches» have been translated into English as ""The Great Fire of London,"" ""The Loop"" and ""Mathematics:"".

About mathematics, here is a conjecture of mine (I didn't find its description anywhere else):The number 28 is the only number that can be written as a sum of the first n integers (1+2+3+4+5+6+7), m first primes (2+3+5+7+11) and p first non-primes (1+4+6+8+9). I was not able to prove it (I suspect it to be related to the Riemann hypothesis).

Some time ago, I had the idea of searching connections between the names of intersecting streets around me. I stumbled upon interesting stories, starting with those linking ""Lugeol"" street, where I live, and ""Lacanau"" street which crosses it. It happens that both streets have a relation with San Francisco:Lacanau is a seaside resort near Bordeaux, it hosts the annual Lacanau Pro, the first international professional surfing competition to be born on French soil. Gabriel Medina won the 2011 edition at only 17 years and a few months later he triumphed at the San Francisco Rip Curl Pro Search.Lugeol street is named after Dr. Lugeol, a doctor appreciated for his liberal ideas and his generosity. In 1856, he declared the birth of Clodomir Largarde of father unknown. It turns out that the mother was actually married and gave her maiden name to avoid a scandal: her husband, Urbain Balmigère, had left Bordeaux to San Francisco for at least 3 years and has since disappeared. I guess Balmigère gave in to the lure of the gold rush, but I do not know what became of him. Do any of you living in San Francisco have heard of the name Balmigère ?

A game : get outside, sit on a public bench or any other suitable place and note what you see or what the atmosphere inspires you, it can be as short as a koan. Send me the text accompanied by the name of the place where you did the observation. If you allow me to publish it, I will place your contributions on a google map.

A bench in Bordeaux (44.837055, -0.571995)There are many pigeons here. Half a dozen children are running towards them, laughing, to make them fly, and then move away until the birds come back. Indeed they are returning, landing in a rustle of wings, in a wave that flows back again at the arrival of the children...""So what happens in this book?"" says the young mother to her son on the bench next to me, when I'm about to open my own. It makes me wonder if 'humans readings books on a bench' is as typical as pigeons coming and going...

Have a nice day!

That quote is probably one of the driving factors as to why I recently left my job of 7 years, moving to a new city to start over.  If you go through life never taking risks, you’re going to end up with a lot of regret.

Life doesn’t happen when you’re standing still.  And while I loved my previous job, I was stuck in my comfort zone.  I wasn’t growing or learning, I could do my job on autopilot.  I wanted a challenge, and I needed a change.  I needed to prove to myself that I could do this.  I needed to prove to myself what others had told me.  That I owed the world more than what I was doing.  That I had more offer.

Have I proven that to myself yet?  No.  Not even close.  But I know I will.  And I won’t give up.  I’ll always keep improving and growing and learning.  That’s my challenge to you.  If you’re in your comfort zone, living in a bubble, get out of it.  Whether you sell everything you own and travel the world, or just move to another city, get out there and do it.

I just got a new job that I’m really excited about.  It’s the start of a wonderful career with a lot of opportunity to grow.  My previous job was a learning experience, but I didn’t have any room to move up.  I wasn’t okay with reaching my glass ceiling at the age of 30.  So, I quit.  I packed up everything I own, moving it all into a storage facility in the DFW area.  In the meantime, I’m living with a roommate on a temporary basis.

Regardless of what happens, that leap of faith was something I needed.  Never doubt yourself.  You have the same chance as everyone else in life to make things happen.  Go after your dreams.  No one said it was going to be easy, but reinventing yourself can be one of the greatest things you ever do.  Each day, week, month, and year, I will get better.

To be completely open and honest with you, I was terrified to do this.  A little over a year ago, I lost my mom after she fought a courageous battle with cancer.  Just four months after her diagnosis, I lost my best friend.  I didn’t want to take a step in any direction without being able to share it with her.  Good news or bad, she was always the first person I called.  She was my rock in life, now she’s my angel.  I know she’s watching over me smiling, happy to see my success, bravery, and newfound zeal for life.

You never stop the grieving process, you just learn to live differently.  Life will never be the same as it was when I had my beautiful, smiling mother here on earth.  It’s just different.  We can be happy knowing that our loved ones are no longer suffering.  There’s no more pain, no more hospitals, no more cancer.  Yes, I lost my mom way too young, and I’ll never know the reason.  But I owe it to her, and to myself, to stay strong and keep going.

I’m looking forward to this new chapter in my life.  I encourage you all to evaluate where you are, ultimately doing what’s going to really make you happy.  Reach out if you want, I’d love to hear your own stories and experiences.

I’ve been thinking about why it is that your email each day means so much to me. The best I’ve come up with is that back in the old days, before tweets and tags and status updates, we’d have had a lot more opportunities to strike up conversation with each other. You know, face to face. You’d have told me your yarn, I’d have shared mine.

I feel like the Listserve is the closest we get to that now – an unmediated insight into each other’s lives.

Keep on sharing. I like hearing you tell me your ideas and experiences, your adventures, victories and defeats, your hopes and despairs, weaving our collective story.

The stories we tell ourselves are important. As individuals, as communities, as societies. How and who we want to be matters. This weekend just gone, hundreds of thousands of people around the world took to the streets to tell the story of our ability to shape a better future. I took part in London. People from all walks of life, marching together against climate change. I often feel powerless reading the newspaper and watching the news. But walking together with others, knowing there were multitudes of other people out there sharing the same vision, made me feel powerful individually and to believe in our power collectively.

Too often we’re taught that we have to accept the world as it is. That the structures and systems of our society, our economy, our politics are unchangeable.

This is not so. Apart from the laws of physics, we create just about everything else. Our world can be the world that we want it to be. It’s time to stop being afraid.

On which note.

Here where I live, in London, BP sponsor the Tate Gallery, one of the UK’s best known art institutions. The Tate Gallery has refused to reveal how much exactly they receive from BP (anything to do with an ex-CEO of BP chair the Tate’s Board of Trustees?) but every day the Tate scrubs BP’s public image clean, soiling the integrity of the arts for a negligible amount of money. While BP feed our addiction to fossil fuels and fuel the climate crisis.

But seeing nearly a million people march, I know it won’t be long until oil companies are obsolete. A blip on history, as archaic as the fossil fuels they depend on.

Were you on the march? Drop me a line and say hi. Next time maybe we can march together.

October 2014,12,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/10/12/the-beatles-had-it-right/,"October 2014, 12",The Beatles had it right....,"One of the most important, inspirational, and meaningful sayings I live by is: ""all you need is love”. I am  24 and a recent half graduated university student. I’m obsessed with chocolate and my favourite book is “Brave New World”. I've experienced many terrible and many beautiful things in the past few years. However I have been fortunate enough to experience falling in love...two and a half times...I say two and a half because two people I know I love and the half…well you’ll see.

The first love was extraordinary. We were together for about a year and a half. He taught me many things that in turn allowed me to grow tremendously as a person. He was also there for me throughout my hardest years of life. During 2011, over the span of 6 months, 5 young people I know passed away. I was a complete fucking wreck and naturally this weakened the progression of a healthy relationship. A few years after these tragedies, and the inevitable crumble of this relationship, I was reminiscing about my former love. I wondered: why the fuck did things turn out this way...? I will never forget what my Mum (I love my Mum...probably much more than she even knows) said to me: ""It wasn't meant to be and that's ok! You know why? Because just by him being present he was doing so much good for you. He was there for you through those difficult moments. He helped you get through that terrible time and that was the purpose for him being a part of your life...to help you.""  - Thank you first love; I don't know if I ever said that to you...

The second love... We met a few years ago during what I like to refer to as the most ridiculous cake incident I've ever been a part of. Picture a two person cake fight amongst a 50 person booze filled slop show birthday party. The cake fight ended with us two cake-covered people cleaning ourselves up and during the process flooding a bathroom using a bidet. Naturally we headed out to the ""hottest"" nightclub with cake bits still crusted all over...we ended the night with ... well I'll leave that to your imagination. I was fortunate to spend the rest of the year getting into many other crazy shenanigans with him. Sadly he graduated and headed to the other side of the country. However a few months later, during the adult version of Disneyland: Shambhala Music Festival, (in Salmo BC...if you get a chance go...it's truly life changing) our paths crossed again. As time has it things came to an end and we both returned to our separate lives...Although not before spending one more week together.

The half love is interesting. We met at the beginning of this past summer. I can whole heartedly tell each one of you that I have never in my life experienced a stronger connection with a stranger....ever. We met briefly and months later we met again... coincidentally at another music festival. Every time we saw each other it was as though a strong cosmic energy pulled us together. It was some magical. I distinctly remember a moment where we gazed into each others eyes for a solid 30 seconds....that's a feat...try it with someone sometime; it's a wonderful feeling. Afterwards we continuously seemed to see each other in odd places around the city. It was nice, however, I soon left the city on soul pilgrimage across the country.... yet not before finding out he too would be at this year’s Shambhala Music Festival.

I travelled around the states and Canada en route to Beautiful BC. When I arrived ""home"" I had a very odd feeling that half love would not be in attendance. I was right...actually a friend had purchased his ticket last minute. The universe is interesting in these regards because guess which love was there? Love number two. It was the first time we had seen each other in a year...and it was beautiful. Everything between us fell right back into place. Following the festival we were fortunate to be able to spend yet another week together. When he left I could barely speak…all I could muster up were copious amounts of tears.

It is so important to share love and appreciation with people. Love is the most beautiful part of life. I want you to know that no matter what or where you are there is love in your life. Love can be found in the Earth's energy, within yourself, in the smile of a stranger, the embrace of someone special, and even in the most painful of situations. Trust that the universe has the best path for you…so follow your heart and follow your feet!

I would definitely be interested in hearing your stories of love, helpful tips on grieving, meditation advice, places to do yoga, and any advice on how to make it in Event and Promotion Marketing!

To each of you I send a bit of loving energy and I hope that you will always tell them how you feel <3

October 2014,11,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/10/11/i-can-see-you-through-this-telescope/,"October 2014, 11",I Can See You Through This Telescope,"Back in the day, astronomers didn't know if there were galaxies in the universe other than the Milky Way.

They could see blobs of stuff in the sky that looked like potential galaxies, but that could also be clouds of gas and dust on the edges of our own Milky Way. How to determine which they were? What was the true nature of these 'nebulae'?

On one side, enter Harlow Shapley. Shapley pointed out that it’s difficult to distinguish nearby, dim objects from distant, bright ones. But given how (relatively) small and bright these nebulae looked to us, if they were distant and comprised their own galaxies, they'd have to be INSANEly bright and far away to appear as they did to earthbound observers. Plus, astronomers had observed a nova in Andromeda that was brighter than the entire rest of the nebula combined-if Andromeda was a whole galaxy, what phenomenon had released so much energy so quickly?

Shapley’s opponent was Heber Curtis. Curtis believed that the nebulae were 'island universes' of their own, basing his opinion on the fact that the spectra of light from these blobs were indistinguishable from the spectrum of the Milky Way (whereas individual types of stars have their own distinct spectra). Not to mention, contemporary theorists were beginning to propose a spiral structure for the Milky Way, just like those of the mysterious nebulae.

In 1920, Curtis and Shapley had a Great Debate in Washington DC. Each scientist presented his arguments, but the debate ended in a draw.

But wait! Several years previously, an astronomer named Henrietta Leavitt (who, breaking gender barriers at Harvard, became one of the greatest researchers of her time) had discovered a relationship between period and brightness for Cepheid variable stars.

Variable stars are what they sound like: stars that vary in brightness over time, waxing and waning in the amount of light they emit. The period of a variable star is simply the length of time between one luminosity peak and the next.

Leavitt discovered that there was a fixed correlation between the inherent brightness of Cepheids, and their periods: brighter stars took longer to go through their full cycle of waning and waxing. Leavitt's groundbreaking research paved the way for the resolution of the Great Debate.

In 1924, (and stay with me, we’re almost done) a young man named Edwin Hubble used the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson, California to locate Cepheid stars within nebulae.

Because Leavitt had shown a relationship between Cepheids' periods and intrinsic brightness, and because Hubble could now measure the period of stars in nebulae directly, he could determine how luminous the Cepheids in the nebulae really were.

From there, it was a short step to settling the Great Debate. If we know how bright something is, and we know how bright it looks to us, we can tell how far away it is-resolving Shapley's dilemma of distinguishing close faint things from far bright ones.

As you (hopefully) know, our galaxy is not the only one in the universe. Hubble’s calculations demonstrated that the nebulae were so far away, they had to comprise their own separate galaxies.

Shapley wasn't all wrong: nebula-like 'globular clusters' do exist within the Milky Way, and the 'super'nova that had gone off in Andromeda WAS an unusual phenomenon.

But these facts weren't obvious at the time. Arriving at a less-wrong picture of the our universe took hard work and careful analysis. Today scientists estimate that the universe is billions of light-years across, but it's worth reflecting that a century ago, most people thought the Milky Way was pretty much it.

Partly for the sake of learning and what it teaches me about me, but also because of the creativity that learning new things breeds.  I like Coursera, Udacity and EdX courses because I am good at working to deadlines and I don't get motivated by badges or accumulating points. I'd recommend Geoffrey Hinton's Coursera course on Neural Networks for Machine Learning!

The common theme among the things I like to learn about is 'emergent behaviour' - when lots of simple systems interact to create complex behaviours. I like ants, slime mould and the brain where lots of simple biological systems interact to create complex outcomes. Ants for example are the most successful living insects and developed farming, both agricultural (fungus gardens) and animal husbandry (aphids and mealy bugs) millions of years before humans - that's right! Ants! I like cellular automata and Conway's Game of Life in particular as well as machine learning and AI. 

Look some of them up and maybe you'll be as amazed as I was.

I also get to apply some of this because I work as a VC in London. I recently started using twitter and enjoy it. So if you want to get in touch tweet me :) @simonpking

October 2014,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/10/09/pale-blue-dot/,"October 2014, 09",Pale Blue Dot,"One of my father's earliest memories is running towards his home, terrified that it had washed away after a monsoon thunderstorm rolled in. He was outside with his older sister collecting drinking water from a nearby well. My grandfather had recently moved the entire family across the new border after the Partition of India in 1947. Lacking basic amenities and accommodation, their first house was built with mud: soil, silt, and clay.

One of my mother’s fondest childhood memory is falling asleep on the rooftop of her house listening to Punjabi songs under the moonlight. She loved the sound and rhythm of the language and wished to learn, but it was of little use in her village. My grandmother would tell her it was a distraction and she should focus on her studies instead. However, my mother has a endless passion for learning and taught herself the basics of the language.

Six decades later my father is an entrepreneur working in Africa and South Asia after spending a career as an Engineer and my mother is as an English-Punjabi interpreter working for the Courts, Refugee Board, Lawyers, Doctors etc. after spending a career as a High-school Teacher.

Now, in their retirement years, though they refuse to retire, both of them use smartphones and tablets and communicate by Email, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Their journey has taken them from reading books under a kerosene lamp to reading books on a tiny device that was simply unimaginable during their childhood.

The world changes at an incredible pace and I can only wonder how different everyday life will be a few decades from now.

At the same time it is extremely unfortunate that too many people have been not been given or have been denied the opportunity to progress and better their quality of life.

I don’t have a solution for this but I wish we, as a society, put more emphasis on enabling education for all and inspiring a passion for learning in everyone because I firmly believe that no learning is ever wasted.

October 2014,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/10/08/a-dream-deferred-works-out-better-sometimes/,"October 2014, 08",A dream deferred works out better sometimes,"With all due respect to the brilliant Langston Hughes poem about racial and economic inequality, in other contexts a dream deferred isn’t always so bad. This is a story about bottling up something you are so passionate about that you might not be ready for in an earlier time in your life, only to revisit it years later to satisfying ends.

Throughout middle and high school, I studied flute. Most of the music I was interested in was composed and played on trumpets, pianos, saxophones, trombones, but not so much flutes. So I drew my ear training and inspiration from the greats that played other instruments. It’s the usual suspects for a teenage jazz fan - Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, Charlie Parker. I also listened to flute players like Herbie Mann and Yusef Lateef, but their recordings were few and far between.

When I got competent enough to improvise, I’d have all of these licks in my head that I’d memorize from the greats - Parker's fluttery runs that would make your heart leap out of your chest, Monk’s inexplicably dissonant but melodic passages, dark, brassy riffs from Miles. But when I tried to replicate them on the flute, they’d sound incredibly corny. The notes were right, the feeling in my head was right, but what it sounded like coming out of the instrument was all wrong. Saccharine. It’s not what I wanted to sound like.

I don’t know why I stopped playing the flute in high school. In my back-narrative, it’s because I could never get it to sound like what I wanted to sound like, but it could have just has easily been because of the social stigma of a dude playing jazz flute in his mid-teens in a city and a school that’s not really about that kind of music. Or maybe I just got into girls and that was that. Whatever the reason, I stopped playing flute and didn’t pick up another instrument for over 20 years.

Then on my 39th birthday I remembered that I’d always wanted to play the trumpet, but was always worried I wouldn’t be able to pick it up. It had seemed like such a different instrument, and so hard to make so many notes out of just three keys. I can’t say that I’d consciously thought about it much in the intervening years, but for whatever reason I’d long since put it away as something I’d just never do.

On that day as the notion emerged in my mind, all of the worries and concerns suddenly evaporated. Who cares if I’ll never be good? Who cares if I try it and then decide that it’s really not for me? Why the fuck not? If I can just learn *how* to play enough so that I can decide if it’s something I enjoy doing, then it will have been worth it.

I bought myself a beautifully restored trumpet from 1947, and have been taking lessons for the past 4 months. And I love it. Just the ability to produce a clear, resonant tone is its own reward and continues to give me a thrill. With no pressure on myself to be great or even good, practicing is a pleasure. I now routinely pack for business trips differently so that I can bring my horn with me. Making small, incremental progress is incredibly rewarding. Whereas it once would have been tedious to spend long stretches of time just focused on exercises and sound production rather than playing songs, it now feels like a gift.

I’ve got more to say on this, but for now I’ll just leave you with these 600ish words and this thought: it’s totally fine to leave some passions alone until you’re really ready to take them on.

October 2014,07,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/10/07/learning-to-disappear/,"October 2014, 07",Learning to disappear,"I work in an Italian university.If Italy is Hell, the Italian university is the vestibule of Hell, as described by Dante Alighieri in the Canto III of his Inferno.  The vestibule of Hell is the place of the Uncommitted, “those/ Who lived withouten infamy or praise”. Dante's poetic justice sentences them to an endless race after a blank banner.

In 2012 Harvard yearly operating expenses were 44% of the yearly state funding of all the Italian universities. We are becoming poorer and poorer. In such a predicament, Italian professors must not only research and teach: they are also forced to spend their time in a lot of administrative and managerial work. Their overwork is  paid with promises – with the promise of blank banners called academic honors. Our government is curtailing our budgets and our academic freedom [1], our country is lingering in an unending crisis, financial and, above all, moral and political. Yet, the game of tenures remains the same, even if it has become so directed by external standards that it has nothing to do with science any longer.

Our government is evaluating our research by asking us: how many articles did you publish? Did you publish them in high impact journals? How many times were they cited?

It is not necessary to bore you with “googleable” technicalities like the serial prices crisis, the growing power of a few academic publishing oligarchs and the open access publishing movement. The major outcome is that we are accustoming to the idea that it is possible to evaluate research, to hire and to fire researchers, through standards established outside the scientific public sphere, by political and market powers. It has already happened – more violently - in the past: the accusers of Socrates were three well-meaning democrats; Galileo Galilei's main accuser was a saintly cardinal. Now we all see them as the villains of the story: how will our well-meaning bureaucrats and economists be judged, tomorrow?  What will the future generations think of our good-natured uncommitted professor and scholars that keep on racing after their blank banners?

Trying to live a committed life in a world of Uncommitted is hard. Maybe my vestibule of Hell is  my personal delusion – maybe it would be better to limit my horizon to my self-interest. Or maybe not. Dante's point of view - the point of view of a fictional afterlife - is a thought experiment, helping us to consider ourselves from the outside. Our self-interest filling the horizon of your life will die with us. Our memory, our footprint on the world, however, will last: how would you judge your footprint after your self-interest is gone? How would you judge yourself?

Everyone of us has been taught to appear. But the time of our appearance is short. Learning to disappear in a meaningful way is a more challenging  task.

Before the cameras rolled, I took a walk with the farmer to inspect the crops. The soil in that part of the world is white and fine - like beach sand. I was amazed that anything grew in it, let alone bulbous aubergines and lush lettuces that were fit for the finest food stores in the world.

She explained to me that her job was not to farm the crops, but to simply take care of the soil. To make sure it is healthy, full of nutrients and regularly rested.

Good crops, she explained, are just the byproducts of happy soil.

As we talked, she spotted something unusual in the distance. She bolted towards it and triumphantly lifted the largest pumpkin I had ever seen. It was growing wildly in the sand amongst the lettuces. The beachy desert sand on her farm had become a fertile hotbed. Whatever seed fell on it just sprouted effortlessly.

It dawned on me recently that everyone of us is farming. No matter what your occupation, you’re growing crops. Your soil is your life. The people you come across. Your family. Friends. Coworkers.

Many of us abuse the soil to grow as many crops as quickly as we can. But a select few understand that what we get back is simply the byproduct of a life well lived.

I am in no position to tell anyone how to take care of their soil, but I have a feeling that being kind, respectful and empathetic to everyone you encounter would be a good start.

The universe is just a big black void filled with atoms filled with voids that operates on a strict set of physical laws. It cares not for our ideas of justice. The oceans crash on the beach in the dead of night just as they do during an awe inspiring sunset.

Good things happen. Bad things happen. In the end all we can be sure of is that the phyiscal laws of nature dictates that good soil will yield great crops. Perhaps that is what all the religions and philosophies are trying to get at with their own versions of ‘reaping what you’re sowing.’

The kindness and respect and empathy you show today might not come back to you tomorrow. But perhaps - in a summer to come - you too will find a giant pumpkin in your lettuces.

I hope to learn so much academically and personally, even if I am a bit scared. Below is a letter to myself then, of what I wish to achieve, work through, and experience in the next four years.

Dear Future Hanna,

Right now you plan to study computer science with a minor in women's studies, then go on to get a master's in library science in order to become a librarian. I don't see you changing your mind as you love books and believe in the power of public libraries. I only hope you are able to find work in a community you love. 

Where are you living? Seattle still, or elsewhere? Where have you decided to get your Master's Degree? I hope it's somewhere back east or the southwest. Have you visited any other countries? What did you learn? How is the family; Dad, with his alcoholism, Jess with a job or college, Katie halfway through high school, and is mom still living in Rogue River? What do you regret not doing?

I hope you keep your wonder for nature and enjoyment of geeky things. I do hope however, that you learn better patience and to not be so anxious.  I hope you feel more belonging at SPU than you did at Rogue River High School, and have the courage to branch out of your comfort zone. I hope you make wonderful friends and maybe even fall in love. I hope you learn to better forgive and be vulnerable. I hope you read some wonderful books and attend a few concerts. Stay thankful, optimistic, and independent. Don't forget to make a few mistakes (but learn from them).

Treat yourself and others gently (especially Mom).

With love,

Currently I’m pre-med, and I sell perfume.

I’ve also been diagnosed with severe bipolar type I with psychotic features, been manic for 2 years, been psychotic for 4 and a half months, spent 9 weeks in the mental hospital, been disabled twice - once for physical and once for mental illness - had three endocrine disorders, and beaten cancer.

*******

I was listening to an interview on NPR with a man who is a double lower-limb amputee.  People, including his interviewer, have a tendency to be awed when people with disabilities leave their houses and do productive and sometimes wonderful things.  On the one hand, I think disability can be motivating: it can teach great empathy, and it gives the stubborn something to prove.  On the other, what is the other choice?  You can either choose to be disabled and suffer in isolation, or you can choose to use a thing you love to overcome it.

*******

Maybe I’m just too stubborn to die.

*******People tell me how brave I am for fighting cancer.  Cancer has great PR, but the hardest thing I’ve done is overcome mental illness.

When you have cancer, mostly all you do is show up: the doctor’s tell you what to do and where to be and you go and they manage the rigors of treatment. Meanwhile, you are surrounded by the support of those around you, labeled a fighter or a warrior or a survivor, and you fight the battle with those you love around you.

When you have mental illness, you have guidance – which is often limited – from your doctors, you manage most of the rigors of your treatment – including figuring out what is going to save your own life – on your own.  Meanwhile, you can’t tell anyone about your disease – and, if you do, you risk being yelled at, ostracized, judged, beaten, spat upon, abused, and raped. (Many of those have happened to me.)  Your treatment, if you end up in the hospital, may include practices that the UN calls torture.

*******

Never feel guilt after a suicide.  You couldn’t have stopped it.  At least there is no more pain.

*******Go for a walk outside every day.  Take some vitamins.  Lay down and take some big, deep breaths.  Take your meds.  Try DBT.  Try CBT.  Learn your triggers.  Get enough sleep.  Trust your doctors.  Talk to your doctors.  Don’t lie to your therapist.  Find acceptance.  Find peace.  Find what gives you joy.  Find a reason to fight.  Find a reason to live.

I've always thought of what I would write if I ever had the opportunity but of course now my mind is blank.

So I've decide to write about three things that are important in my life at the moment.

1. Music: Music has always been a huge part of my life. I've never been the type of person to say what I'm feeling or what is on my mind but I feel I can express my feelings through music.Here is some good music I've been into lately and favorites that I've always loved:OctaHate by Ryn WeaverOblivion by BastilleThe Mother We Share by CHVRCHESEd SheeranMayday ParadeThe City and Girls by The 1975

2.Samantha: I see the love of my life this week after being apart from her for almost two months. Many people roll their eyes or look at me in disbelief when I tell them that I've found ""the one"" at 22 years old. I can honestly say that I have. When I was 18 I had a relationship with someone that I was so sure of being the one. I was certain that they were possibly the person I could spend the rest of my life with. As time went on things started to change and so did the both of us. She started planning important things in her life and I was just waiting to start mine. Eventually, our relationship ended and I realized so much at this point in my life. I realized that I needed to learn to love myself first and find happiness within myself and not others. Looking back on that time I realized how much I was in love with the idea of us more than the person I was with. Now, in my current relationship I know how it feels to find your better half and be in love with them through every obstacle. She makes me want to be a better person and strive to do well in life. I'd be lost without her and I can't wait to see her.

3. College: Since before I graduated high school I always wanted to go to college and try to further my education. Towards the middle of my senior year after I had applied to Penn State my step mother told me I wouldn't make it. She said that I wasn't made for college and it would be hard for me to succeed. Immediately I became scared and worried that she was right and took a year off after high school to work and practice to get into a music school. I ended up learning a lot about life. Working for a restaurant, retail, and the post office. A year turned into four and I was approaching my one year mark at the post office with a pretty decent pay and hours when I realized I wasn't happy. I didn't want to do this for the rest of my life. So, I decided to go back to college and forget about all my fears. My stepmother and father felt the same exact way as they did when I graduated high school which only fueled my desire to succeed more. Now, I am about a month into my first semester and I'm doing great so far and I plan to graduate with my nursing degree.

Overall, don't let anyone tell you can't do anything because you can do anything with hard work and determination. I know that is cliche but it's true.I would love to get to know any of you and I'm here if anybody needs to talk or vent. It's a tough world out there and sometimes we just need someone to listen.

Feel free to send you favorite song and/or artist to me and I'll return the favor:)

I hope you all have an amazing week!

All schools in the UK must legally provide Religious Education (RE) to its students, this dates back to a time when a huge number of schools providing free education were Church schools. At various times it has been known as Religious Studies or Religious Instruction. In the past it was entirely Christian in nature and taught as fact. Nowadays it must be predominantly Christian and also reflect other beliefs prevalent in the local area. For this reason there is no National Curriculum, instead in each Local Authority (LA) area a council (SACRE) is formed of local teachers and leaders of local religious organisations as well as representatives of the Church of England to decide what students in their area should study between ages 4-14 (whilst they could advise up to 18 in my experience they instead advocate taking an approved exam course at this stage). SACREs can include Humanist representatives and many (all?) SACREs recommend teaching about atheism and reasons for non-belief as well as taking a critical approach to religion as the students mature. Since under this government many schools have become academies and are therefore freed from their LA they are freed of following SACRE guidance, but they would have to justify major changes to the syllabus. Faith schools are free to only teach about their religion.

Government guidance says the purpose of RE is 'spiritual, moral, social and cultural development'  'personal development and well-being' and 'community cohesion' - no small task!

The Problems RE Faces

- In (non-faith) schools it is often the lowest priority. Primary school teaching is often poor, with the teachers reluctant to tackle a subject they feel they know little about and that has the potential to offend. In Secondary schools it is often given to non-specialist teachers. PSHE and Citizenship are shoe-horned into it, and GCSE courses are expected to be delivered in half the time given to other subjects.

- There is no academic subject called RE. An Ofsted report last year said RE was confused about what it was trying to achieve. The curriculum is decided by, and the subject is taught by, a mixture of theists, atheists, theologians, priests, philosophers and sociologists. If we could decide what the subject is we could decide how to teach and assess it (or even if it can/should be assessed).

- There is little public understanding of the need for the subject. Public perception is often that it has not moved on from the days of RS/RI. There are particularly low results for the white working classes - the group least likely to be religiously affiliated.

- Education Secretaries do little to help the image of modern RE by sending editions of the KJV to every school (Gove) or by being a vocally conservative Christian (Morgan).

- The leeway given to faith schools (including redacting exam papers) undermines the work done in other schools.

I am out of words to mention more issues, let alone attempt solutions. I hope this was informative and feel free to e-mail if you'd like to talk about any of it further.

September 2014,30,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/09/30/random-sic-bullets/,"September 2014, 30",Random [sic] Bullets,"Listserve winners are supposed to avoid cliches. Here are some haphazard (random means something else) things you won't hear just anywhere.

Google ""learn acbl"". This will show you how to learn to play bridge (the greatest card game of all). You'll thank me once you turn 80.

There are two kinds of friends: those who are friends when you need them, and those who are friends when convenient. I don't judge, since I think each kind is valuable. I do think it's important to distinguish between them.

Spend as much as you can on your reading glasses. Seriously, get the most attractive frames in the world. Then, each time you wear them, you won't think ""I can't believe I need reading glasses!"".

Understand apologies (particularly if you want a long, happy marriage). In particular, this is an apology:

    I shouldn't have done what I did. I am sorry. I know better now. It won't happen again. How can I make things better?

This is NOT an apology:

    I am sorry if anything I said might have upset you.

This is SOOOO not an apology:

    I'm wrong and I'm sorry. Keep in mind that everything I did is EXACTLY what I should have done and, faced with the same circumstances, I would do exactly the same thing. Again and again, forever, but I do apologize.

Star Trek II is the best movie ever.

So yoga...

Do pullups. My wife's cousin build his house with a three story rope in the center. If you ever meet this guy, he'll insist you won't be able to climb it. Be ready.

I have no kids. My best friend has four. I think this is perfect for each of us. He gets to rationalize his suffering, telling me I'll die alone. I get to sit down with some snacks and spend an hour listening to him complain about parenting so I don't feel like I've missed anything. It would be a little better if I didn't live 2,500 miles from my niece, but that's nitpicking.

A 600 word limit is strict. You can't even play with the font to cheat...

The human brain is wired for gratification. That's basically what gratification means, I guess. Studies show that lots of little goodies make you happier, overall, than one big one (think several vacations vs. a big house) because we adapt to luxury, quickly.

Similarly, anticipation is underrated. I always choose 10 day shipping from Amazon because it stretches out the anticipation, increasing my overall satisfaction. Strange but true.

Watch The Mighty Boosh.

When you're about to click send, check the ""to"" and ""cc"" lines. Again.

Really, check again...

Math Stuff:

George Box said ""Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful."" Keep that in mind with Big Data, Climate Change, Evolution, Particle Physics, etc. A model that describes reality is great, even if quarks are just mathematical constructs.

Read about Bayesian inference on wikipedia. It's popular now, so it's worth understanding. Make sure you understand how someone got a prior distribution before you believe their conclusions.

Read about linear regression on wikipedia. Anscombe's quartet is counter intuitive. Why? Because three of them don't meet the assumptions of the model. There, I said it...

In particular, google ""standardized fruit regression"".

Google banach-tarski-non-paradox. Mathematicians may tell you they can prove ""you can cut a baseball into pieces, and re-assemble it into a basketball."" Blah, blah. They don't understand the definition of the word ""can"".

The more someone insists they know the answer to the Monty Hall problem, the more annoying they are. They are just as wrong either way, though. This applies to me, too.

September 2014,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/09/29/the-joy-of-languages-advice/,"September 2014, 29",The Joy of Languages & Advice,"I speak more than 8 languages. But that wasn't obvious at all from the start. My parents don't know any foreign language and my first contact with another language was at high school. Classes were not particularly effective either - how could they be, with 45 minutes of speaking time divided between 25 students and a teacher?! I got C's and D's mostly. Until I discovered the internet. I found that I really wanted to be able to talk to people from all around the world.

German (my native language) didn't get me very far. English helped me make friends in the UK, Canada, USA and even as far as Australia. It was tempting to stop there, but I noticed that most of my contacts still came from Western countries and I didn't hear many voices from poorer parts of the world. Learning French, I suddenly had more contacts in many parts of Africa and the Middle East, where French is the language of higher education. Spanish opened up South America for me. Esperanto gave me a lot of opportunities to travel (google my name and ""How Esperanto changed my life"" if curious). Chinese provided amazing insights, since they basically have their own internet, just as large as ours but with different trending topics, different petitions, right down to different memes. A whole new world at my fingertips. Besides, speaking English in China I was seen as a walking wallet, while speaking Chinese earned me real friends and an unforgettable trip.

I love languages, I just had to try them outside the classroom. Classrooms are boring, real life is fun.

MY TOP 3 TIPS FOR YOU:

1. Look for the fun. Too many people think that language-learning won't ""stick"" unless they're bored. The opposite is the case. If you're having fun hanging out with foreign friends or reading cartoons, that's when you'll learn a lot, because the brain is relaxed.

2. Aim to spend 10 minutes studying languages every day. If you're tired, just watch ""funniest Spanish ads"" or whatever on Youtube for your 10 minutes, sing along to a song or read a newspaper article online. If you're more awake, study a course or learn some vocabulary. To increase your chances of studying every day, find stuff to do while commuting, cleaning or on lunch break, for example listening to podcasts or using a mobile app. Variety is the spice of life (and learning). Whenever you managed to do 10 minutes of study, mark the day in your calendar and don't break the chain!

3. Use any opportunity to apply what you learned. As soon as you know how to say ""Hello. How are you?"", start using those words with restaurant staff or other local native speakers. You can also find language exchange partners online.

For more tips, google ""LearnLangs"" (my blog). There are also other polyglot blogs, Youtube channels and forums giving tips on how to learn languages. Before you invest in an expensive course, check out what kind of high-quality courses are available for free online. I'm creating such a website myself right now, it's called LearnYu and will teach Chinese. At this point, there are so many resources that you can learn any major language for free online.

I'll leave you with something to think about: ""Languages cannot be taught, they can only be learned"". Start learning!

The Internet is the ocean and even the tiniest of pebbles will create ripples. Each Listerv posting is a pebble with ripples that reach many thousands all over the world. The question for us Listservians should be what can we accomplish together to begin to engineer change that does not involve governments or corporations?

My concern for the past six years has been with the ever growing crisis of families and their creatures becoming homeless, including myself and the cats. The cats, Charlie in particular, have not been impressed with my efforts to obtain justice in a clear case of foreclosure fraud by a major bank acting as a trustee for a Mortgage Backed Security (MBS). So, Charlie has made a video “Calling All Cats The Series”. Charlie will shortly be launching a fund raising campaign called Saving Our Humans........another pebble!

We are all faced with challenges and difficulties in our lives so how can we help each other and save ourselves, the creatures and our still beautiful planet?

If you live in the USA and you know of some family that needs help to avoid becoming homeless please e-mail Charlie through me at the e-mail below. If you want to help Charlie and his human (me) please e-mail me and I will let you know how.

On June the 11th, my boyfriend and I were offered jobs in Belize.  The catch....they needed us there on July 10th.

We had 29 days to divest ourselves of our home and a very large portion of our stuff and things.  We never really considered ourselves particularly acquisitive or consumerist but my 37 years and his 42 years of accumulation added up rapidly.

As we had only a general idea of where we would be living when we arrived in a country we had never before visited, we didn't really know what we would need.  But we did know that customs duty would have to be paid on anything we brought.  So things had to go.  The furniture was returned to my great-grandmother's country home for the most part or sold.  The bulk of our clothes went to the goodwill (I wasn't going to need my ""lawyer clothes"" thank goodness). Our crystal, silver, china and art were parceled out among our closest friends so that they might have the enjoyment of it rather than it sitting in a box in a storage unit. In the end, we managed to reduce three thousand square feet (plus an attic & a basement) of goods and chattels to 149 boxes....many of them quite small boxes.  We were proud.

I will admit that I cried over the books, all of the books, so many old friends.

In the course of that same 29 days, my boyfriend became my fiancé and then my husband.

So, we have been in Belize for 40 days and married for 50.  Both of these things have required major adjustments.  This isn't the first time I have lived abroad but it is the first time I left the States with no intention of returning.  It's a different state of mind entirely.  There is no concept of if this doesn't work out we can just ditch and go back.  Marriage, it turns out, is much the same state of mind.

We have been told that we are amazing, and adventurous, and just plain crazy.  We are all of those things.  And we are more, we are growing and adapting and, mostly, we are just damn lucky.

That's our story to date....I would love to hear about the time any of you completely left your comfort zone and any advice you might have on transitioning from the first world to the third world.

Have a lovely day.

No life message here. I am asking for tolerance of you all. I am Transgendered, which means in my case I was born a male and I feel and present myself (sometimes) as Female; I prefer to describe myself as a ""Non camp feminine male"". All I want is to be able to wear the clothes that make me happy wherever I happen to be, home, work, social places, everywhere. I ask only for the same freedoms of expression that the majority of women (in the western world) enjoy. Without fear of censure, ridicule, prejudice or violence. Is that so bad? Most of what we consider the socially normal Male/Female split in appearance has evolved and sometimes swapped over the development of our civilisations, many “Aboriginal” cultures accepted the different varieties of sexuality among their populations and it is only recently and in western and middle eastern cultures that prejudices against these different people have arisen. Either through religious ruling or individuals scared of their own sexuality, of being attracted to same sex persons who happen to be dressed as opposite sex, which suggests it may have been the clothing, the presentation that they were always attracted to anyway, not the person inside. So please think carefully when you see someone dressed in a manner you might not personally approve of and allow them to be themselves, they’re not actually causing you a problem are they? thanks for listening.

September 2014,23,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/09/23/four-score-and-over-seven-years-ago/,"September 2014, 23",(Four Score) And Over Seven Years Ago,"I had to pick a song, during my first week of my freshman year in high school, that was supposed to represent me. Most of the class picked ‘Eye of the Tiger’ by Survivor, aka the Rocky song. I remember being particularly annoyed because I didn’t think these 14 year olds had a lot of ‘straight to the top’ survivor material, but perhaps it was more aspirational. I was never really able to do that, to say “this is how I’m going to succeed and just watch it’s going to be amazing.” I was more of a Little Engine That Could: I think I can, I think I can…

During college, I discovered someone else who had a similar style: the 16th President of the United States, better known as Abraham Lincoln. When running for the Illinois legislature, he wrote the following:

“Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition. Whether it be true or not, I can say for one that I have no other so great as that of being truly esteemed of my fellow men, by rendering myself worthy of their esteem. How far I shall succeed in gratifying this ambition, is yet to be developed. I am young and unknown to many of you. I was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy or popular relations to recommend me. My case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of this county, and if elected they will have conferred a favor upon me, for which I shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate. But if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit to keep me in the back ground, I have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined.”

He was 23 at the time, earnest, melancholy, and truthful. We would all look back now and say, but of course! Lincoln was always going to be President. He was destined for greatness. Maybe that’s so. But more often than not it’s perseverance, indecision, uncertainty, course correction, lots of standing still, impostor syndrome, and what feels like dumb luck. That’s the more common route to personal success.

For me too. I learned how to be good at my job by failing at it. I have never gotten a greater dose of preparation than the time I failed a college course with an 8% (though to be fair, passing was 12). When I finally got into a job I loved, I spent the first six months in awe of my luck. The next, terrified I would be fired for being awful at it. And another six months after that before I realized there was very little luck in involved. Working hard, showing up on time (mostly), always expressing a willingness to learn and try new things - these are things that got me there. Not luck. And failing had taught me how to admit defeat, when to ask for help, and how to break down what I didn’t know and cut through it piece by piece. If someone had told me that was what success meant, I don’t think I would have been quite so scared I would never get there.

But my freshman year of high school I was very uncertain, very earnest, and perhaps a bit too truth-telling. I picked ‘Hands’ by Jewel as my song. It was embarrassing in light of all the tigers in the room, but it’s what came to mind when writing this:

“If I could tell the world just one thing, it would be that we’re all okay.”

It makes me really happy to hear stories on National Public Radio and other places talking positively about the general response to all these problems on college campuses. But sexual assault doesn't just take place in college. It doesn't just take place between strangers.

Our ideas about justice need to shift radically. Look into Philly Stands Up. Look into ""transformative justice."" Look into a book called ""The Revolution Starts at Home.""

""Wherever you go, however you dress, no means no and yes means yes.""

I want to take a moment to address my male-identifying audience more specifically. You may think this issue doesn't affect you.

It does.

1 in 3 women are the survivors of sexual assault. And most sexual assaults go unreported. Do you have a sister? A mother, an aunt, a niece, a cousin, a grandmother, a partner, a friend? 1 in 3. You may think the issue doesn't affect you, but all it takes is one moment for a decision without thinking, one moment of carelessness. Then you've hurt someone forever.

Prison and punishment alone don't stop the cycle of violence. In a lot of ways, prison, the law, the courts, only promote the idea of violence, are a form of violence in themselves. We need caring communities. We need models of transformation that turns those who perpetrate sexual violence into responsible members of the community. We need to show each other care and love. It needs to start with each one of us, and not wait on the (often slow, often hurtful) apparatus of the state.

I have one chance to talk to thousands of you, and I'm spending it on telling you this: ask. Treat others as you would want to be treated. I've seen a lot of happy emails from the listserve, a lot of emails talking about start-up companies and travel and living the good life, people who are looking for their purpose in life. People with a lot of privilege. Put your privilege on the line and give time to people and organizations who need help combating sexual violence. If this email helps just one person, if it helps someone draw just one realization, if it gets just one more person talking with their friends or organizations about sexual violence, then I consider the listserve a success. But we need so much more than just one person.

I’m happy to report that I am spending considerable amounts of time in the kitchen now that I’m a grad student without a job (yet), and operating on limited ingredients sure makes whipping up a meal worth looking forward to on par with working on an art project in terms of the innovation required.

I gotta tell you though, I’m in love with the skies. Here they feel a lot closer to the ground, a moving canvas that draws you in while it rearranges its parts. San Francisco welcomed me at dusk. And as I sat in a speeding car on the highway with my back to the airport, I marveled at the beautiful eeriness that accompanies fog as it proceeds to envelop mountain tops and skies. It rolls in like a soft avalanche everyday at dawn, and I wait for it with the eagerness of the uninitiated. It is beautiful.

It’s been exactly one month since my arrival, and I find myself slowly slipping into the crevices of what makes everyday life, everyday life. I talk to people I don’t know and I smile back at those who smile at me.

My corner liquor store owner, who is Arab (I haven’t figured if he’s Lebanese or Palestinian yet), goes out of his way to infuse Arabness into my life - either by refusing my money when I dash into his store for a quick grab of gum/water essentials before my bus arrives, or by playing Najwa Karam (Lebanese singer, look her up) sporadically when he glimpses me approaching from a distance.

My days are often punctuated with unexpected gems that manifest while I listen to the most random, most profound, conversations on the bus as I make my way to and from school. Like the elderly man who wore a grey suit and matched it with an olive green checkered scarf to go with his grey-green-striped hat, who commanded everyone’s attention as he drawled in his thick, deep voice the beauties of the Rembrandt painting he held in his hands. A black* man. He said he was an artist and I was certain he was a nutter, despite his handsome attire. ’You know what this is? This is a Rembrandt painting, and it’s going on my wall. Ooooh yeah, it’s going right there on my wall’. At that moment, he appeared to me as though he was sitting on top of the world.

Or that other time when I sat across from a pretty girl with dimples, also black, who was talking to her friend about things I wasn’t present enough to pay attention to, until she suddenly started talking about one’s roots. She addressed her friend, a white girl, and declared that she was confused by her friend’s roots. That they were ‘thin and long, yet they were strong. That the roots were not proportional to the trunk of the tree, which is huge, and that they ran deep into the earth, but that they were slender.’ She thought that was weird. She had her eyes closed the whole time she was talking, as if she was imagining those very roots. She was  slightly smiling. I smiled too.

* My references to skin color have more to do with my ongoing observations of race dynamics in the US than anything else. I’m also still learning about accurate forms of reference so if anything I say seems un-PC, please excuse me. It’s a process.

I only had one idea for this email that I thought would be any good but then I decided it was condescending and dumb.  Also I found out the night I'm writing this (well, about a half hour ago) that my girlfriend of almost four years may be ending things with me very soon and I'm pretty depressed.  I haven't had to deal with this before.  I don't want to be alone.  I wish I had made different decisions.  I'm guessing I'll feel better within a few days.

I don't want to waste my opportunity to send out a Listserve email though, so I'll give you some of my favorite quotes.

There is only one way to achieve happiness on this terrestrial ball, and that is to have either a clear conscience or none at all. -Ogden Nash, poet (1902-1971) 

In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit. -Albert Schweitzer, philosopher, physician, musician, Nobel laureate (1875-1965) 

Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. -William Butler Yeats, writer, Nobel laureate (1865-1939) 

Most people think that shadows follow, precede, or surround beings or objects. The truth is that they also surround words, ideas, desires, deeds, impulses and memories. -Elie Wiesel, writer, Nobel laureate (b. 1928) 

The high-minded man must care more for the truth than for what people think. -Aristotle, philosopher (384-322 BCE) 

Truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it. -Flannery O'Connor, writer (1925-1964) 

On the mountains of truth you can never climb in vain: either you will reach a point higher up today, or you will be training your powers so that you will be able to climb higher tomorrow. -Friedrich Nietzsche, philosopher (1844-1900) 

There comes a time in a man's life when to get where he has to -- if there are no doors or windows -- he walks through a wall. -Bernard Malamud, novelist and short-story writer (1914-1986)

I live a few thousand miles away from my birth family, so having another family close by is a welcome gift--I married into one, for certain values of ""married""--but it's a gift I'm still learning to appreciate, since I've been living this far away from my birth family since I was 17 and only got engaged much more recently.

I guess the only thing that makes this all noteworthy is that I'm gay, and obviously so is my fiance, and we're going to get married in Hawaii at the end of the year because our families will both be there at the same time. Also gay marriage is legal there, but that's kind of irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, we can just do it in California first and then have a stress-free ceremony on the beach in Oahu since we'll all be there anyway. It's also all because of Justice Kennedy's opinion in Windsor, ultimately, I guess. So bravo, Justice Kennedy, and the senator of the same name that stopped Bork and ended up getting you nominated in the first place, way back when.

If you've read this far, I salute you, since that is saccharine bullshit. It's all true, too, but I'm also thinking of tossing myself in a mental institution for a week or so in the coming days. I have that thing white people get where we all get sad starting in the fall, but out here in San Francisco September is actually our June (followed quickly by several versions of our November and then a June again), so it's really unclear when fall starts. I have other problems too, but that's the main one in this particular case. I'm not really that fun I don't think.

So I guess here are my requests for people to internet-hang-out-with:    --People who want to help write a novel about the CIA response to China finding lots of oil in the international part of the South China Sea    --People who have experience with depression and how it makes you stupid and shit    --Anybody who wants to talk about math    --People who know me    --Or just whatever, send a kind word, I could use it.

Anyway, thanks for reading,

I guess I have a few words left, so here's a poem I didn't write, by Leonard Cohen:

If it be your will That I speak no more And my voice be still As it was before I will speak no more I shall abide until I am spoken for If it be your will 

If it be your will That a voice be true From this broken hill I will sing to you From this broken hill All your praises they shall ring If it be your will To let me sing From this broken hill All your praises they shall ring If it be your will To let me sing 

If it be your will If there is a choice Let the rivers fill Let the hills rejoice Let your mercy spill On all these burning hearts in hell If it be your will To make us well 

And draw us near And bind us tight All your children here In their rags of light In our rags of light All dressed to kill And end this night If it be your will

Thank you all for reading and thank you all for posting. Now that I've spent time looking at the e-mail saying I'm selected, I understand how hard this is.

In conclusion, please remember that you are loved. Sometimes I forget, but I hope you don't.

I don’t care what kinds of things you make, but make something. You can do it by yourself, or you can work with someone else, or you can make something based on someone else’s work. Here are some suggestions of things you can make:

A bowl of pasta with homemade sauce and meatballsA robot that you can play catch withA story about a girl and her pet ratA webpage that generates new, exciting, and sometimes nonsensical jokes about nosesAn edit to wikipedia about a topic that interests youA quilt for someone you care about like a petI enjoy every part/phase/stage of making.

There’s the planning stage, where you try and come with ideas, turn them around in your mind and tweak them until you can bring it into the world.

There’s the scavenging phase where you find and bring together all of the pieces/thoughts/feelings you need to make the thing inside your head(s).

There’s the doing phase, where you take something like a blank page, an existing project, or a box of parts and transform it into something new/different/better/worse than it was before

And then it starts over again. The thing you’ve made eventually changes again. Sometimes it’s entropy as it falls apart. Sometimes it’s you, coming back to tweak what you’ve created because you had another idea. Sometimes it’s teeth, because you’ve baked a delicious cake and there’s no point in letting a cake go to waste.

You’ll be able to look forward to some part of the making process, or think back to the end result and it’ll make you smile or frown or both.

If you need help making things, or want to share the things you’ve made, or you’re looking for people who like making just as much as you do, you should see if there’s a hackerspace/makerspace/sewing club/quilting mafia/organic food co-op near you and you should get involved. We humans are social creatures.

So, I'm a brand-new 7th grade English teacher. I work in a school where something like 80% of the kids live below the poverty line. Many of them have families who are barely making it. Many of them wear the same clothes to school multiple days in a row. For many of them, school lunch is the only meal they will eat that day. Many of their parents struggle with drugs, alcoholism, or are incarcerated. And here I am, some 25-year-old white girl who saw Freedom Writers and wanted to make a difference. Want to know a secret? Some days, I feel like I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. Yes, I do know some of what they're going through, I guess - I grew up in a similar situation, at least financially. My single mom worked three jobs while going back to school, raising me, and supporting my great-grandma who has Alzheimer's, but then she got cancer and we were on assistance for a while during my childhood. I had a grandmother who robbed my mom blind in the middle of all of this to pay off gambling debts. I've never met my dad and that's admittedly always left a bit of a hole in my heart. I know some fraction of what these kids go through, but every situation is different. I have no idea what it feels like, for instance, to come home to your mom's boyfriend holding a gun to her head. (Some of my kids do. That's tough to stomach.) And the work environment itself is tough. Because of the demographics of our city, the taxes are very low, and this translates to things like no air conditioning in the schools (temps reached 102 in my classroom this August). I'm not really complaining, because I am just in LOVE with these kids. They are truly remarkable. But it's still really, really hard.

The truth is, I sometimes feel completely snowed under and overwhelmed. Teaching is the hardest thing I've probably ever done, but I really honestly truly madly deeply feel like God has been taking care of my little introverted soul during these first three weeks of school. It's little things - every morning, hearing an encouraging song on the radio on my drive to school. When a kid comes to me for advice or just needs me to listen to them, and I'm blessed with just enough time to give them my ears for a few moments and it really seems to lighten a bit of their load. I've worked with kids for a while, in various capacities, before teaching full-time. But there is nothing quite like being in the middle of giving a naughty class a little talking-to about respect, and getting to the part where you tell them you're disappointed because their behavior is telling you they don't really care what you have to say (when they're talking while you're talking, tapping on desks, and otherwise not paying attention), and being completely cut off mid-sentence by the ten rowdiest, most ornery, most disruptive kids in the class dramatically and loudly objecting that you are, in actuality, their favorite teacher and that they can't WAIT to come to your class every day. That they feel like it's home. I almost cried in the middle of my serious talk! Here's God's honest truth: every day I internally question whether I truly have what it takes to be a teacher. And every day, there they are: the 77 silly, sweet, remarkable reasons I stay.

I say these things because I've been through just enough suffering in my short life to finally be touching the very outermost tip of a realization: that no matter what you're going through - and I mean no matter WHAT - there is always, always, always hope. That and Jesus help me get through my every day, and I hope it helps you, too.

Hi, my name is Eriko, I'm a 20-year-old IT student here in the Philippines. I've been watching anime ever since I was a kid and up to now I'm still doing it. I'm thankful to the internet because it gave me free access to new anime episodes straight from Japan. It's pretty awesome to still continue a hobby that I have from when I was a little lamb. I started watching anime over the internet back when I was in middle school, it's probably over 6 years ago. I pity myself back then because I always thought that I have no talent. In our family of 5, I have two older brothers, both of them can draw anime very well, same goes with my pops. Me, on the other hand, can't even draw a proper stick man. This self-pity continued up until high school.

High school came and I got myself into a forum about a particular game. The forum closed along with the game, but us users of the forum still want to continue our conversations. We decided to make a website that we can use. Ever heard of Ning? It's a website where you can create your own social network. At ning you can customize your website's CSS. That's not just for the administrator, but for the users as well. Just like the old friendster, at ning you can add a small code of HTML, and by adding an external stylesheet you can edit its CSS. It made me interested in CSS. It's funny because I first learned CSS and then HTML. After some years I finally got comfortable with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and nowadays I can create a website from scratch! It made me feel good inside because I finally got my own niche.

Fast forward to the present day. I mentioned that I like reading other people's articles, right? I mentioned all my three hobby at the start of this e-mail. I've combined all those three hobbies that I have on the internet and the result is ""Kuru Anime."" It's a website about Anime where users can post blog, drawings, and have conversation on the forum. It's just starting, sooner or later we'll have anime streaming and podcasts about anime. It's a website where I can do all of my hobbies. Neat, right? It might seem crazy but I'm thinking of making it a full pledge company. A small company like 9gag. If my plan succeeds, then that would be awesome.

""Talent means next to nothing, while experience acquired in humility and hard work means everything."" My hard work was rewarded with 130 members, 30 of which are active. It might not be that much but it's still pretty impressive considering that I just reopened it last month. If anyone of you are interested about the website you can contact me on my e-mail and ask for the link. Thank you for reading my short List Serve! Now I'll go back to watching The Amazing Spiderman 2. Bye!

I moved away about six years ago, but I know that's where I'll probably settle back down.- One guy I went to high school with was killed about a week and a half ago. I wish I could say he's the first.  A different girl I went to high school with's son was killed by her boyfriend around the same time. He was two. If you're the praying type, Big Ant's and little Josiya's families would appreciate it. If you're not that's cool, just try to do something to decrease world suck today with them in mind. Actually, even if you do pray, try to do something concrete too.                -Slight tangent: I realized awhile back that many of the people I met in college had never known anyone who died violently, or even just died young. I once had a conversation with a girl and noted that it was entirely possible that 50% or more of our lives might be over. It didn't go over well, but it's important to remember.  - Church was good today. We just started a series called ""Live and Let Die."" Appropriate, I guess, given the above.- I should be writing an exam for my ESL students right now. I got my Bachelor's in translation, but had a hard time finding a job working with people. I did not want to translate documents, so I went back to school for a TESL degree. That's where I am now.  Teaching adults has been wild. I'm still not sure if I'm any good at it. They often don't tell me when they don't understand things, so it's been a little rough figuring it out.                - Fun story about how strange it is to teach in a university setting: My students did not know the word ""spread."" I explained it could be used for both things and ideas and asked for examples. One girl just looked at me and said, ""Oh, like disseminate.""-I really want to travel once I finish my Master's in a year-ish. I love languages. I'm not always good about studying, but I have a list that I'd like to at least become conversational in. I'm hoping to teach abroad for 3-5 years. My friends keep pushing me towards the Middle East. I think I'd like it, but my mom would have a heart attack. One of my professors is pushing Chile. I've got time to decide.                -Quandary: I really want the whole marriage/babies life too. It's supposed to be easier if you start before 30, and if I travel I'm gonna be pushing that limit. 3) Things I like:-Languages! If you speak Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, or Malay and would like to chat, I would love penpals. Those are my focus right now, in order of ""fluency."" If you speak Turkish, Korean, or Tagalog, that's what I'm studying next.-Soccer! I'm a goalie.  Arsenal, Monterrey, and both US teams.-Books! I will read nearly anything. If you have any recommendations (in Spanish or English) I'm interested.-Being joyful! Not always happy, but damned if they can take my joy.4) Vonnegut wisdom: ""I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, 'If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.'""Hope to hear back from everyone. Much love.

I fundamentally do not know.  But in my case, the acts of both reading and listening to music have made my life more enjoyable than it may have been, and have helped see me through both good and challenging times.  So here are some of the highlighted works running in and through my life; ones I have found solace and joy with over the years.

books/authorsPaul Auster – I have enjoyed all his fiction and believe he is one of the best and most creative/inventive writers around (if interested try Moon Palace, Leviathan, or the Brooklyn Follies to start)Ann Patchett – Again I have enjoyed all of her fiction. Some of her books are outstandingly & stunningly great – i.e. Bel CantoWinters Tale – by Mark Halprin (excellent book – lousy movie)In the Skin of a Lion – by Michael Ondaatje (Sooooo much better than the English Patient)Poet/Philosopher Gary Snyder – try reading anything almost anything he has written.  Both his poetry and prose have been very dear to me.  He is truly a master zen/ecologist.Cryptonomicon – by Neal Stephenson (just an awesome tour de force read)Cowboys are My Weakness – by Pam Houston (very fun and funny book of short stories)Fortress of Solitude – by Jonathan Lethem (very good book to read on a long bus ride to NY City)Animal Dreams – by Barbara Kingsolver (I loved this one a lot)Little Big – by John Crowley (this is a very very interesting book, almost made my brain think differently after reading it… if that is indeed possible)James Wright – his poetry is haunting and real (just read it, listen and feel.  you wont be disappointed)Night Film - by Marisha Pessel (very interesting, weird and terribly awesome book)the Lorax – by Dr. Suess (everyone should commit this to memory or read it many times to all the children and adult children you know)A River Runs Through It – by Norman Maclean (so much better than the also truly great movie by Robert Redford and although im not religious in my leanings I find great solace in this story, besides its about fly fishing (sort of) so its got that going for it….)Young Men and Fire – by Norman Maclean (one of the most compelling non fiction books I have ever read, and being a scientist I have read quite a few…)

MusicThe Music listed below happened along, bubbled into my life and somehow managed to change me inside in some fundamental way. (order here is of no import.)  I don’t have much to say about these albums, either they speak to you or they don’t, but if interested give them a listen, (I promise none of them will hurt you.)  One thing you can tell from this list is that I’m one of the old fogies on this listserv.Elliott Smith – Elliott SmithThe Flaming Lips – the Soft BulletinBon Iver - Bon IverLove – Forever ChangesLiz Phair - Exile in GuyvillePavement – Crooked Rain, Crooked RainCaravan Palace – PanicBilly Bragg and Wilco – Mermaid Avenue (the first one)Joe Pug – Nation of HeatDavid Crosby – If Only I Could Remember My Name.Genesis – Selling England by the PoundTom Waits – Nighthawks at the Diner & Bone MachineJoni Mitchell – Bluethe English Beat – I Just Cant Stop ItSopwith Camel – the Miraculous Hump Returns From the Moonand it wouldn't be complete withoutNick Drake – Pink Moon (a creative young man slowly loosing his shit while he happened to be making an amazing recording.  really worth your time.)

My name’s Emmalee, and I’m a second-year behavioral neuroscience student at Northeastern University, in Boston. Back home, in Raleigh, North Carolina, I have a pediatrician mom and a pharmaceutical-chemist dad, a 16-year-old brother who’s already seven inches taller than me, and a ten-year-old tortoiseshell cat who opens all our cabinets.

This past year has, overall, been a great one. Northeastern is a fantastic school, with all these completely unique opportunities, and I have more close friends than I’ve ever had at once in my life, some of whom I’m certain I’ll still be friends with decades from now.

And Boston is such an incredible city. It’s easy to get around, there are delicious restaurants and interesting things around practically every corner, and nearly everyone I’ve met has been welcoming and friendly. People back home told me I was going to hate it up here because of how rough the winters are, and admittedly this past February tested my resolve a little, but it made the spring all the sweeter when it finally arrived in late March. I really couldn’t be happier with my choice to come up here, is what I’m saying. And honestly, I could see myself spending the rest of my life here.

Except.

As much as I wanted to get the heck out of North Carolina after 18 years of living there, I’ve found myself missing parts of it far more than I expected, sometimes. I think the food is probably the biggest thing (what do you MEAN, you’ve never had pimento cheese, or grits, or barbecue?!?), but there are days I just long for the mountains, or the beaches, or my home region, the Triangle (the nickname for Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill). For all its flaws, North Carolina is home to a lot of beauty, and a lot of potential. There are great universities and companies conducting promising research, and the local food/art/music scene is flourishing. More and more people move there every day.

I don’t know if that’s enough to make me want to go back. I had good reasons for wanting to leave. And I really do like it up here.

I’m just terrified that no matter where I end up I’ll never be completely happy, because if I go back to where I came from, I’ll remember why I originally left, but if I go anywhere else, I’ll still miss North Carolina on some level, however small.

So far the best way I’ve come up with to deal with this is by carrying little bits of North Carolina with me, up here. I cook Southern food for my friends, and tell them stories and traditions from my home state, and always, always use “y’all” instead of “you guys.” Little bits. Little reminders of the place I came from.

So far it’s been good enough.

I’d love to hear from other people who moved far away from their birthplaces when they became adults. How did you cope with it? Did you leave regretfully, or happily, or a little of both? Did you end up going back someday? And if you have a favorite recipe from your original home, would you mind sharing it?

Anyone who lives in Boston: what’s your favorite place to eat/thing to do here?

(Shameless plug: check out Northeastern radio, WRBB 104.9! We have a website.)

And in the broader sense, I’d like to hear from anyone, about anything! You don’t get to write to 25000 people from all over the world every day.

Best of luck with life,

Education at its best.","Hello Listservers,     This is not a typical email, but try and read through it. There's a poem at the end. It will all make sense (hopefully)!     Somebody who I'm close with once read me a six word memoir that went something like; 'Religion is meaningful, irrational, convince me.'     I agree with the first two parts of his statement, but this idea of convincing doesn't always sit well with me. Religion does grant meaning in regards to providing a context for social interaction as well as life-cycle meaning to the human condition.     I also firmly believe that belief in the divine is to a certain extent irrational, because of a few inherent contradictions (good things happen to bad people etc). However, the attitude of the last two words of “convince me” is not necessarily the best way to go about approaching religious, education, and honestly any sort of education.     I worked as a writing tutor. I had one student who would bring in these fantastic conceptual ideas like explaining how conservation and awareness of nature can even extend to outer space. His ideas were great, but his writing organization could have used some work. I couldn't just hit him over the head with a blunt instrument of thesis statements. Teachers and tutors should not (usually) be barbarians. We need to practice finer arts of swordsmanship, and lead our students into understanding how to be better people, or better writers (if the two aren't the same thing already).     In other words, we can't settle for just trying to convince people of certain things (the existence of God, how to be better writers, chemists, teacher, thinkers, vikings) we have to lead them to the proper understanding of truth. This can be done through didactic methods such as leading the class through questions. It can also be achieved through interaction with artistic mediums that relate to the source materials. I took a poetry course and astronomy simultaneously. During that semester, I tried to incorporate elements of astronomy into my poetry as well as try and interpret poems through the lens of astronomy. I think educators when writing curriculums need to foster a cross-flow between subjects.     As an Orthodox Jew, I would like to speak about Buddhism and how it can help us understand my approach to education. There's an idea of prajnaparamita in Mahayanna Buddhism. It refers to the perfection wisdom and deals with what truth really is. I won't get into that stuff so much, but basically it means that there is an understanding of reality that goes beyond deep conceptual knowledge. Most buddhism will say that the world is only first hand experience. Concepts and ideas are all second hand. While I think the Buddhist sense of ultimate knowledge goes deeper than how I am applying it, the message of multiple levels to truth is still applicable to teaching. While we can't always give our students first hand experience (Edgar Allen Poe can't teach the class or read his work anymore) we can help make the experience of a classroom a more inviting,engaging, and enjoyable place for students.     I'm a senior in college majoring in English, and enjoy thinking about and discussing these things. If anyone has actually read through this entire piece, or can refine my understanding of Buddhism, poetry, religion, atheism, astronomy, or anything mentioned in this email please message me at

Though it is anticipated because of his illness, the pain and sadness is worse than I expected, I might have imagine, predict, forecast but when the reality comes, it is worse. There is no time you will be ready to lose someone that you love and there is no words can describe how heavy the pain is.  This whole experience also teaches something new, so heavy sadness can paralyze you, literally, it is true. Like I am trying to standing when I come in to the room where my late grandfather lied but I cannot because the wave of sadness is so big.  Paralyzed. Numb. Weak.I am a true believer that the best regret in life is for the things that you didn’t do rather than something that we did. My biggest regret with regards to my grandfather departure is I don’t spend enough time to know about his childhood, his teenage life, his young adult life, his ambitions when he was young, his achievement when he was young, what drives him happy when he was a young man; all the things that he went through before he is a grey haired man who raised me.  I have this privileges that he knows me so well, my ambitions, my accomplishments, things that make me happy, things that I like but I don’t know those things about him.  I am not. I will never know.  I only know him as my grandfather, I f I can turn back time, I want to know him as a person, as a man before I came to this life, before he became my grandfather.

His last question to me whether I am happy considering my miserable love life.  He told people that the only thing that still keeps him alive is because he wants to assure my happiness so I told him before he went comma that I am happy that he doesn’t have anything to worry about, that even though my love live is complicated, I am happy in my own way, he doesn’t need to worry about me..

I considered myself strong enough to deal with my grandfather departure while other people expect the worse from me because of my intimacy with him, I don’t cry a lot especially in front of my mother and my grandmother; I work like nothing happens, like my grandfather, one of the most important person in my life is still here and every weekend, he will wait for me to visit him.  What they don’t know is the first time I cried out loud after the funeral is when I flipped over the photo album and found his picture as a young man laughs, he looks very happy as a young man but yet I don’t know that part of his life, not even a bit.  The second time is when I found my pictures inside his wallet. The third time is when I told my mom about my accomplishment in work and she replied by saying that usually she will share this kind of news with my grandfather and he will cherish it like it was his own accomplishment.  The fourth time is when I found his handwritten of my daily schedule as a high school student.  .  Everything that makes me cry about him is everything that show how much he loves me and his love is how he will stay alive with me even after he is long gone..

Comic idea

Workers are clearing a road. They start bulldozing through a hill and bones start spilling out.“What do we do, boss?” Boss shrugs. They’re on a timetable, so they should keep going.

Later, a worker cuts into a steak. Tiny bones start spilling out.A worker does laundry. When he lifts up a portion to put in the wash, a skull tumbles out.A workers mows his lawn. Instead of grass clippings, bones spray out.

The road is abandoned.

September 2014,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/09/05/two-truths-and-a-lie/,"September 2014, 05",Two Truths and a Lie,"I have a travel blog.

I was on the show Survivor.

I killed a bear chicken with my hands.

Two truths and a lie is a game I love to play with strangers. It's a great icebreaker. When I play with friends, I have to get creative, as they usually know what actually happened and what's a figment of my imagination. But with strangers, it is easy to pull from the archives.

A year ago, to this day, I found myself in the company of four other strangers, who quickly became fast friends on our eight-day trek to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in Africa. We had reconvened in the tent after hours of hiking thru the picturesque Tanzanian terrain. Oddly, I must have given a different impression to the group, as the immediate and general consensus was ""No, you don't have a travel blog.""

My adventure travel companion and best friend, Jackie, sat in the tent tight lipped trying her best not to reveal any clues. I clarified to the group that I meant to say that I killed a chicken with my bare hands and not a bear chicken but they were still adamant that I didn't have a travel blog and swore they recognized me from the great American television show. (Unfortunately, this was the lie as I have yet to be on Survivor).

Shortly after the trek, I returned home to my bright (and teary) eyed family and friends to answer numerous questions about this oh so challenging but ever so rewarding experience. After a few questions about the loss of oxygen (and my mind) with increasing altitude, summiting Kili and you know, not showering for eight days straight, I found myself stuck with the same question.

“So, what’s next?”

It’s a year later and the question still lingers, as it should. I’m not going to sign up to conquer the remaining seven summits. Not yet. Nor am I going to spend the rest of my vacation days climbing Mount Everest. Every morning, I’ll take to the city streets of Manhattan just as I took to Mount Kilimanjaro with the New York state motto, Excelsior (Ever Upward) in mind.

While I’m nostalgic for the past and find myself digging up a good throwback Thursday pic, I remind myself to always move forward, one foot in front of the other at my own pace. It’s not about the mountain or where the path will go - it’s the steps I take to get there. Maybe today’s the day that I… call up an old friend I lost touch with. Say yes to a blind date. Dump a bucket of water and donate to ALS. Take on a freelance project. Or study a new language.

My advice to you is to make that step too. Take that leap, in life, in love, in work, whatever it may be. Just jump into something you feel passionate about and continue to challenge yourself, learn something new, and inspire. And travel, often. Embrace and engage with the people you meet along the way. It’s the best way we can learn from each other.

Listserve friends, I’ll leave you with a quote from the ever-inspiring Nelson Mandela:“After climbing one great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb.”

September 2014,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/09/03/own-your-choices-guys/,"September 2014, 03","Own your choices, guys!","It all comes down to choices.

As I reflect now, a few months from entering a new decade - my 30's, I realize that I've made a lot of poor choices in the past. I've chosen to disregard certain friends' feelings when making reckless decisions. I've chosen to do stupid, unsafe things even when completely unnecessary. For those choices that hurt others, I am deeply and sincerely sorry. (Do you also find it harder to forgive yourself for your mistakes than to laud yourself for your successes?) I've also made some good choices. I've worked my ass off to go to school and law school and pass the bar exam (twice!) and cultivate some relationships and try hard to be a good daughter/sister/wife/mother/friend. Some of my choices, I feel guilty about. I'm a fairly new mom, who chose to work from home. I could have focused more on growing my law practice helping those in need of good afforable legal help, or worked more hours at the startups that me, my husband and one of our friends founded (RentalRoost, Houserie, and GrayRoost - check it out!). But instead, I chose to channel my energy on this tiny human being that I created from scratch (with my fun, amazing husband Vik who is also my bff). I chose to embrace being a mom more than being a startup co-founder or an attorney. I feel incredibly guilty. Like I'm a bad feminist. Like Sheryl Sandberg is tsk-tsk-ing me right now for not leaning in. But at the end of the day, doesn't feminism just boil down to the beautifully simple quote by Rebecca West ""Feminism is the radical notion that women are people."" But maybe being a feminist means being able to make that choice rather than just have it handed to you. I think most people are feminists. If you think that your mom/sister/daughter/girlfriend/wife is her own person and should be able to have the same rights as you, then you're pretty much a feminist. And there's nothing wrong with that.

I want to shout out to my little brother Harish who is one of the bravest people I know. In addition to just exploring and doing cool things, he was brave enough to just quit his job and start an awesome company to redefine design education (DesignLab). Even if we may fight as all siblings do, he inspires me every day to seize the day and to do things that scare me.

I also want to shout out to my incredible parents and also my friends. They have helped mold me into who I am today. They inspire me to be better, stronger, smarter, braver, more forgiving, more patient, and just all-around better.

And of course, my daughter. If every choice I ever made (both the terrible ones and the good ones) led me to Vik and to her, then I would do it all over again in a heartbeat.

I will leave you with this:* Always have lavender essential oil on hand. (E-mail me if you want to know why)* You always have a choice in every situation, even if the only apparent choice is the way in which you react to it.* Be kind. Each person is fighting their own battle you don't know about.* Adopt a pup. It will change your life for the better!* If you're so inclined, let's be friends!

I see many of the emails here are from people (mostly younger than myself) who are on the verge of some great adventure, leaving for school, traveling the world, starting a new business (that surely will someday change world) I'm here to say that some parts of life are not as exciting, and that's ok to. It's ok to live in a small town, not travel the world, or be the next big business venture, it's ok to work the same job for many years or be a stay at home parent. These are the people that make the world tick, these are the nurses, and garbagemen and factory workers, the cops and firemen and salesclerks, they are the volunteers and fundraisers and hot lunch makers. These are the people who keep things running and clean, and keep the safeguards in place, they are the steady, and the quiet population that give the travelers, and dreamers, and the  transient and upcoming youth of the world a place to build their dreams, and grow roots. If these people weren't in every community  there would be nothing to come home to, no where to arrive at. Notice them, when your running  to your next great adventure, thank them for doing whatever it is that they do. And do not be afraid to find yourself one day, one of them.

Just because you are one of them does not mean you will not find great satisfaction in your work, great love from friends and family, or that you will be bored or boring.

August 2014,31,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/08/31/jew-ty/,"August 2014, 31",Jew-ty,"I am an Australian Jew. 

At a Nazi rally in Berlin around 1935 my great aunt remembers hearing her father say to her mother, 'We must get out of here'. She still doesn't know whether he meant the rally or the country. 

But they did leave and came to this great land by way of Germany, Poland, The Netherlands, France, Spain, Portugal and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).

They were lucky Europeans, doctors, businessmen, radio presenters, smugglers of wet wads of banknotes sewn into buttons of fur coasts, friends of Marlene Dietrich, owners of pearls, POWs of both the Germans and the Japanese, soldiers for the Allies, translators at the Nuremberg trials, Mossad language experts, displaced persons, refugees, Ashkenazi BRCA 2 gene carriers and, in the end, Australian. As Australian as it gets.

It was my partner that first coined the phrase Jew-ty. He thinks it's naff. I think it perfectly describes a very personal obligation that is based on a shared cultural history of tzedakah (equity), chessed (kindness) and rachamim (compassion). Without these things neither my family, my community nor I would be here to tell you our story.

I think it was this sense of Jew-ty that first drew me to the Middle East. When I was growing up nothing could start as big an argument at the family dinner table than the mention of Israel/Palestine. I found it amusing to start the conversation (at 7 or 8 years old) and watch my mother (a pro-Palestinian liberal Jew) and my father (an indoctrinated Zionist from a religious family) fly off the handle.

Since then, I've made it my mission, my Jew-ty, to educate people more about the region so that these sort of blind arguments happen less.

That's why I work as an international development consultant focussing on the Middle East, taught Middle East politics at university, hosted a radio show about the region and launched an online project called Gaddafi's Pyjamas bringing together people's stories to try to build up a more nuanced understanding of this complex and beautiful region. 

Most recently, together with my friend Saba Bebawi, we are hosting a series of seminars beginning with Syria in the Spring (September/October 2014) all aimed at beginning a new form of dialogue and communication about a region that is often misunderstood and misrepresented but nevertheless, raises such passion and politics in people. An Arab and a Jew, each month, listening to each other, discussing and engaging.

I am convinced that listening at a human level is how people change, how they evolve. Perhaps it's the only way an individual can make change in the world. I see it as my own Jew-ty, and perhaps everyone's duty, to listen to others; to really listen and hopefully learn. 

I'm not saying it's easy. In fact, it is very difficult, but it's the only way I know to make our relationships with others and the world more meaningful.

I like to think of my father and mother as my first students. It's taken almost thirty years of conversations, stories and personal interest but my staunchly ZIonist father can no longer stomach policies of occupation and oppression and my liberal, peace-nick mother would now even contemplate a trip to Jerusalem.

L'shana habaah b'yerushalayim. Next year in Jerusalem, for everyone.

Some of the best uses of modern technology, imho, are those that try to bring people together, to foster communication, to open minds, to leverage this amazing global web for the betterment of humankind, even in modest ways.

The Listserve does that. Boingboing, the wonderful blog where I first heard of the Listserve, does that too. The whole ecosystem of online review sites does that (or at least it used to, before most of them descended into gamified sock-puppet botmarts full of fake accounts and spam).

And that's also the ambition behind Passing Remarks. This is a free, non-profit site that a friend and I built, which lets road users connect with one another using only their number plates.It's our old-fashioned attempt to use web tech to tackle a very real social problem: road safety.

It hit me one day while gazing in terrified awe at a particularly reckless overtaking manouevre. I realised that our vehicle registrations, these very public signifiers, are effectively useless to us citizens; only the police and other authorities hold the keys to their use. ""What if we could email any driver we saw?"" I wondered. ""What would we say? Slow down buddy? Thanks for letting me merge? Your brake light is busted? Would road users exchange constructive criticism? Or would it degenerate into road rage and name-calling?""

Well, like many Listservians, I'm a developer, and so I set about finding out. Now that Passing Remarks has been running for several years, I have some answers to my questions. And they're encouraging!

More than a third of all messages (37%) are complimentary, e.g. ""Thanks for the jumpstart"" or ""We appreciate you slowing in our neighbourhood."" It seems there's a sizeable group who'll say something nice, if given the chance. This should reinforce continued road manners.

A slightly higher proportion (41%) are neutral in tone, e.g. ""You broke the red at 53rd and 3rd"" or ""You speed past my house every morning"" (users can include maps too). That's fine, I think. Most people are open to changing their driving, I suspect, once they realise its effect on others.

Only 19% of remarks are negative, offensive or aggressive. Those are discouraged, and users are requested to Be Polite, but maybe it helps to let off steam.

Finally, there's some flirtation going on! For example, ""Hey gorgeous in the black Saab! You have a secret admirer in a blue Camry."" That sort of thing.

Anyone can make remarks on the website itself, no registration needed, but my favourite bit is ""email any driver"".

Suppose you're cut off by truck registration GBQ 7198 (example plate from Wikipedia). You can simply mail , putting your message in the subject. In other words, every car, everywhere, now has an email address! Drivers just have to log in to read their mail.

You can test it yourself by mailing your own number plate [at] passingremarks [dot] com. Remember, message in the subject. Then just visit the website (Google “passing remarks driver”) to check. Wait a while, though, it takes a few minutes.

As I said before, the idea behind Passing Remarks is to boost road safety. It's really just an experiment, but I'd love to hear any ideas to improve it at the address below.

Thanks for reading - and major thanks to the Listserve, for keeping email important!*

* The Atlantic had a great piece on this recently BTW. Google “email still the best thing”, highly recommended.

Growing up, my music teachers told me that I was ""musically gifted."" It all started with the piano. Then the flute. And the guitar. And the ukulele. Did I mention I was also the champion recorder player in elementary school? Big Deal. I know. BUT that doesn't mean I was actually good at everything, because trust me, I'm not. I might be ""gifted,"" but I can also be lazy. So in addition to playing instruments, I love listening to them aka going to concerts. Maslow was wrong when he said we need to satisfy our physiological needs before we can focus on our other needs; I'd rather starve and attend a show, because priorities. I swoon hard for artists who sound like butter, especially those males. And when I listen to these artists, I like to emulate what I hear. I like to play my instruments and sing. In the shower, in my bed, in the car, on the moon if I could. Now we're going to shift gears and talk about college. I went to the University of Virginia--shout out to my fellow Wahoos. For the same weird reason we call our campus ""grounds"" and refer to freshmen and sophomores as first and second years (love ya, TJ), a cappella is a big part of student life. When I got to school, I thought a cappella was dumb. Given my ""extensive"" experience with instruments, the idea of singing without them was ludicrous. Then my friends dragged me to an a cappella concert. I saw a girls' group on stage, and I was mesmerized. To quote my gal pal and U.Va alumni, Tina Fey, I saw them on stage and thought, ""I want to go to there."" There are three main all-female a cappella groups at U.Va., so I tried out for all of them. Because of the Snowpocalypse (the year we got a zillion inches of snow, totally accurate statistic btw), the schedule was set up differently that year: two of the groups' callback auditions were first and the third group's callback audition was the next week. I got called back to all three, which made my ego big enough to fill a Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade balloon. Gross. Fortunately, all the helium in that ego disappeared when I was rejected from the first two groups. After these rejections, I was devastated. I didn't realize how much of my identity I had put into music. I also got a rude awakening on the subject of humility, as in, I didn't have any. I mentioned I was lazy, but I realized that my laziness can be the result of my complacency, and smug people suck. I moped around before I also realized I could continue the drama queen life or do something about it. And I can honestly say I have never practiced so hard to get where I wanted--a spot in that last female group. When I look back on this experience, I remember the dramatic angst I felt, but I'm also reminded of one of many things it takes to be a person of good character. I'm going to be a teaching assistant this upcoming fall. I'm as excited as I am nervous. I'm working with kids that come from completely different backgrounds, some more broken than others and others perhaps who are not so broken at all. Either way, they are kids that deserve to know and take advantage of educational opportunities. All students deserve that. And in some sense, I will be a role model to these students, so I want to be the best example I can be. I'm terrified and humbled by this opportunity, so I'm sharing this story with you as a way to keep myself accountable. Don't let me down.

August 2014,28,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/08/28/choose-your-own-adventure/,"August 2014, 28",Choose Your Own Adventure,"Hello, Listserve!

My name is Melissa, I’m 48, and I'm a work in progress. Right now, I’m in Washington, DC, staring down an overpriced coffee, pondering life and where my next chapter begins.

I’ve been to the foot of Mount Ararat. I’ve snorkeled with sharks in the Andaman Sea. I’ve been held at gunpoint by Chechen Mafiosi and stood at the bottom of the stairs of Air Force One. I’m fun at parties. I’ve rolled naked in the snow after a Russian sauna, been knocked into a sewer in Uzbekistan, and on the first day of my current job, I was blessed by the Dalai Lama. I’m a storyteller, a total geek, a devoted friend, and I’m as capable of loving and being loved passionately and fully as anyone else you will meet.

I’m also fat.

With many people, that’s all they see, all they care to know, and all they think I am.

It saddens me when people judge me exclusively on my physical form. It kills me that many see me as less human than they are—less worthy of respect, dignity, decency, or love—because of the curves of my body. It infuriates me that I still sometimes let it bother me.

My mom was a pilot—a WASP—in WWII. She dealt with bigotry, ignorance, and even aircraft sabotage for the honor and duty of flying some of the most exciting—and dangerous—warbirds ever to grace the sky. She always told me to take chances, follow the more challenging path, and never let anything stop me. I try to remember her advice every time a stranger randomly passes judgment on me for my weight.

Screw ‘em.

I am not defined by my body. Neither are you. Definitions are limitations. Defy definition, embrace your quirks, be good to others, and be as happy as you can. As for me, I’ll keep moving forward, with joy and adventure in my heart.

Here’s a little of my personal philosophy for getting through this life:

- You are your own best advocate—for health, for work, for choosing the life path you need to take. Don’t wait for others to take you by the hand and show you the way.

- Do crazy adventurous things, even if you get hurt now and then. You will have amazing stories—and possibly awesome scars—to share for the rest of your life.

- Don’t be afraid to love people, even if some don’t love back. Just know when to cut your losses and move on. (Still working on this myself.)

- Buy your own roses. You deserve them.

- Carve out a little portion of time every day to do something creative or something that feeds your passion. And share what you make! If you put it out there, you can’t hide in fear of rejection. Good, bad, ugly, totally unabashedly cheesy—boldly embrace what gives you joy.

Recently, I resurrected my long-dormant blog and cleaned off my drawing table. I find contentment in the moments I steal to draw or write, and I’m grateful for the indulgence of friends on social media in encouraging me for what I post—my tentative steps toward a real creative leap of faith.

A few weeks ago, I found out that my job is likely ending around Christmas. Facing down 50, I have to re-invent myself. Is this the time to take that huge creative leap? I think and hope so. Who knows what I’ll find on the flip side.

Time to hold my breath, count to three, and jump. Care to join me?

1)  Exploration. I'm from the States but travel / live abroad 100% of my days. I'd love to hear about your excursions, and places that I miss as I conduct mine. I post shots from my iPhone on an Instagram account:  @N_AMERICAN_SCUM (no fancy camera - this helps keep it about the experience, not the photo)

A few places I've visited over the past year where the sense of adventure felt especially real:

-Mount Kinabalu, Borneo-Jungles of Amazonas, Brazil-Mount Kenya-Cradle Mountain, Tasmania

2)  Auditory pleasures. Sometimes music feels like the end all / be all to me. It comforts, it mends, it inspires, it makes nearly every situation better.

I write this while listening to one of my favorite albums ever:  Nord by Year of No Light. Ben Frost's A U R O R A may be my favorite album thus far in 2014. I'm pretty excited about The Underachievers LP coming out next week, and Run the Jewels 2 whenever that happens to drop.

Let's talk about music on Spotify:  kpa_kpa_kpa

3)  The saccharification of starch and the fermentation of the resulting sugar (thanks Wikipedia!). I spend far too much time seeking out the beer innovations and successes of various cultures around the world. Let's discuss - Untappd: @N_American_Scum

A few of my beer happy places:

-Jester King - Austin, Texas-Mikkeller Bar - København, Denmark-TØRST - Brooklyn, New York-Moon Dog Brewing - Melbourne, Australia

That's all. Looking forward to meeting all of you; electronically, in real life, or otherwise.

I have the same trouble most people express on here. What profundity (that had better be a word..) do I have worthy of this list?My initial thought was absolutely none. I am a boring, middle 30's, white, middle class guy living in suburban USA. What could I possibly have to share?

I guess I have lived a bit more interesting life than most people. I am originally from rural New Zealand; lived briefly in Australia (stint in Sydney; shorter time in Brisbane -  I would love to move back if I could); moved to the US where I have lived in various parts of the north east (NYC that amazing, expensive, dirty, smelly, chaotic place); wealthy and pretty Connecticut; Boston and its northern suburbs (love New England - sorry CT, you don't count); and now hot, humid, miserable (but winter kicks arse) north eastern Florida.

Thanks to my work I have seen so much more of the US/Canada than most Americans/Canadians (or most others really) ever get to see. From Quebec/Montreal/Toronto/Ottawa/Halifax to Calgary. 

Seattle to San Francisco, the midwest (northern - e.g. Minnesota, Michigan, Illinois to southern - looking at you Texans and Okies), the east coast (Maine down to Florida) and in between. There are still some glaring holes in my US experience - the mountainous west - Montana (been to CO), and the more southern, western states (AZ, NM and UT etc). Definitely looking for tips/advice on cool things/places to see/do when I travel to those places.

I have also recently been on quite a personal transformation. Moving here to the US and traveling for work was an awful health combination. I used to be a healthy, fit person. Then I put on a TON of weight and felt like crap for years (almost a decade). I recently finally lost 50 pounds in about a year and am well on my way to being lean and toned again. People are amazed when I show them what I used to look like. This was the first time in my life I ever had to try to lose weight, and it SUCKED. Despite what the ads tell you, it is tough. For anyone who has been overweight a long time, feels miserable about it and wants to lose it but can't, for the first time in my life I feel your pain. I know now how tough it is. 

If anyone wants any simple advice/support on losing weight, or wants to chat about being overweight and trying to lose, let me know. Heads up - I am not interested in specific 'fad' diets - e.g. paleo, IF, whatever. In my opinion, it is simple stuff - but tough. 

Finally my bit of compulsory life advice - be open to opportunities for something different - no matter how small. They are out there and pop up when you least expect. Keep an eye out and don't be afraid to jump at them. When I was younger I had no idea what I wanted to do and was discouraged about my future. No longer. Roll with it and life can take you some unexpected places.

I would love to hear from anyone, anywhere, about anything (hopefully something in here has given you something to talk/ask about). Even if it is just for my/your perspective on things or to share your own experiences/feelings about anything in here.

Obviously with how surreal being chosen to write is!

Secondly, a massive thank-you to all the fine penmen and women past and future who have and will continue to make a minute or two of my everyday a little different, a little interesting, a little funny.

Most day’s I feel like most people: a little bummed out, a little ungrateful, a little lethargic. But on a rare few special days I feel extremely privileged. Privileged that despite a modest upbringing in one of the poorest countries in the poorest regions of the world, that I have much of the same opportunities as people in the rich world. It isn’t so much that I have these opportunities as it is about the environment in which I have these opportunities: it’s about opportunity with perspective.

The opportunities I’ve had means that everywhere I look I invariably see poverty. People whose lives are measured in dollars: less than $2 a day, if that. But perspective means that I also see beauty and happiness. Lots and lots of both. Everywhere!

On those days, I look around and see people and things whose worth isn’t measured in currency. And poverty looks much like the problems you’d find anywhere in the world—different but the same.

On days like this pity seems especially profane and I acknowledge that there’s so much real, authentic beauty in the world, if only I learn to see it. And I realise that the truest way to make a difference is to sincerely start with myself. To try and see things as they are, not as I’m told they are. To see things with “beginner's mind.”

The root of all humor is ""the swerve"". This is an element of surprise built into the structure of a joke which pulls the audience off of the implied path into a punchline. The strength of a joke is related to how strongly the implied path is set and then how well you can craft a swerve that people can follow.

The simplest joke I know of to use a swerve is a form of comic triple: a to-do list joke (""my weekend projects: 1- fix door, 2- sweep garage, 3- kill my wife""). The first two items establish a straight line to follow and the third swerves from it in a surprising way.

Jokes can also intentionally not swerve, and exploit an audience's expectation of a swerve to form the surprise element.

One of my favorite types of jokes is latvian joke which as far as I can tell was invented by a guy named Chris Connolly, so (congratulate/get mad at) him for it, not me:

""Joke: Man is hungry. He steal bread to feed family. Get home, find all family have sent Siberia! 'More bread for me,' man think. But bread have worm.""

I ask that if you choose to read this email that you do so with an open mind. I have no intention to offend - only to challenge a way of thinking. Please consider that :)

Let’s talk about dogs, shall we?

Have you ever wondered how dogs became “pure bred”? Did God create each breed specifically? Maybe natural selection after millions of years created the English Bulldog?

Dogs first became domesticated when they learned that they could survive more easily by working with humans than fighting against them. Once we started living with dogs we started preferring the ones that worked to our advantage. We selectively bred dogs that were good hunters, or good protectors, etc.

In the last few hundred years we decided that dogs could also be companions, and accessories. We could breed them to be tiny and portable. So we bred dogs to be what we wanted, and then we gave them names. Pitbull. Rat Terrier. Pug. Bulldog. Labrador. German Shepherd. Collie.

It is crucial to understand this: WE CREATED “PURE BRED” DOGS. Dogs did not evolve this way naturally.

That doesn’t sound so bad, right? We’ve manipulated evolution to our advantage. Sounds smart to me.

In theory - yes.

However, in the last hundred years things have gone sideways. We have placed a higher priority on appearances, and the name of the breed. So much so, that we only mate these dogs with their same breed, which has resulted in serious in-breeding, and the progressive shallowing of the gene pool for these dogs.

Google a picture of what a bulldog looked like a hundred years ago. They were tall, strong looking healthy dogs. Now, English Bulldogs can’t even reproduce on their own - they must be delivered via c-section because their heads have become so massive over the years. They have numerous health and respiratory problems because their faces are so squished. Their life expectancy is SIX YEARS.  Why are we doing this to dogs??

Science is showing us that many many pure bred dogs are much more susceptible to health problems because there is simply not enough diversity in their gene pool. Cancer, anxiety, yeast infections, respiratory problems to name a few. I know an eight month old Dachshund puppy with severe joint problems due to bad breeding.

So where am I going with this?

I would like to suggest that we consider mutts and mixed breeds as just as wonderful, if not more wonderful than “pure bred” dogs. Their genetic diversity means they are much healthier overall, they live longer, and they are every bit as adorable as that Pug, or Frenchie or other “name brand” dog that is so cute in the pet store.

I would also like to suggest that Kennel Clubs are furthering damaging and archaic notions by refusing to allow the introduction of other breeds to promote genetic health among pure bred dogs.

The reality is “pure bred” is just a thing we invented.

Now I know a lot of you reading this have pure bred dogs as pets. And I in no way mean to devalue your wonderful pet and how special they are to you. What I hope is that maybe some of you will reconsider before you walk in to a pet store and purchase a pure bred puppy. Pet store puppies often come from puppy mills - which is another serious issue.

What if instead, you went to your local shelter or looked up rescues online and saw what kind of abandoned dog you might adopt? You won’t pay thousands of dollars, just the shelter fees. You won’t encourage inbreeding or puppy mills, you will rescue an amazing pet that someone else discarded. Maybe even consider fostering - so you can pick a pup that truly fits your lifestyle. There are lots of pure bred dogs who need to be rescued too.

It is my sincere hope that we can think critically about this issue, so we can all have happy, healthy pets. This is something I'm passionate about, having seen too many wonderful dogs with terrible heath problems.

Thanks for listening. I welcome your feedback.

I only see Michael once a month or so (through our work with the Young and Well Cooperative Research Centre) and, when I do, he always gives me a gift: a definition for a new word, a connection to someone wonderful, an affirmation of the way I parent my teens. An introduction to ListServe was one of his gifts, and I'm grateful for the chance to share a little of my life with you.

I'm a doctor, lawyer, and company director, living my life between Australia and New Zealand, with my husband and three children. I recently turned 40, and love the courage and integrity that I see in phenomenal women all around me.

As I write this, I'm sitting at beautiful Queenstown airport after giving the opening keynote for the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. I shared the stage with an extraordinary young woman named Jen Morris who told her story of having her trust violated during medical ""care"". I wish more doctors had the chance to hear the untold stories of harm that can be caused by treatment that was intended to heal. Next month, I'm off to London to speak with medical regulators from around the world about high-risk health practitioners. Does it surprise you to learn that in Australia fewer than 5% of doctors account for nearly 50% of patient complaints?

Earlier this week, I sat around the board table of Summerset retirement villages in Wellington.  (Did you know that the percentage of women on corporate boards is still less than 20 percent?) At the dawn of the 20th century, children outnumbered the elderly by 8 to 1. Soon, there will be more over 65s than children. I'm not yet sure what this means for us as a society, but I welcome the chance to help shape that future with Summerset and the University of Melbourne's new Master of Ageing.

I also care deeply about the health and wellbeing of young people. Next week, I'll be with Family Planning - supporting their work towards sexual health and reproductive rights around the world. Already, I see the difference we are making by improving access to long acting reversible contraceptives, supporting the rights of sex workers to a safe work environment, and enabling teachers with a sexuality education resource called Safe Landing.

Between my travels, my dear friend Sarah (who walks with me at dawn), and my beloved book club (who introduce me to treasures like Hannah Kent's ""Burial Rites""), keep me safe and grounded. When I travel, I'm often joined by one of my children or my inspirational 72 year old mum, who prides herself on learning something new every day.

Finally, in celebration of the people who light up my life with joy and laughter, I give you the gift of my favourite cake from Moosewood restaurant. It's rich, dark and delicious; has no nuts, eggs, or dairy; and is easy enough for little helping hands.

Six-minute chocolate cake

1 1/2 cups plain white flour1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1 cup white sugar1 teaspoon baking soda1/2 teaspoon salt2 teaspoons vanilla1/2 cup vegetable oil1 cup cold water (or cold brewed coffee)2 Tablespoons vinegar

Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl. Add the first three wet ingredients and combine. Then add the vinegar and mix quickly. Pale swirls will appear as the baking soda and vinegar interact.

Pour into a 9 inch cake pan and bake at 375 degrees (190 C) for 25 to 30 minutes.

If desired, ice with a simple glaze of melted chocolate mixed with hot water or milk.

Celebrate life with your loved ones and share your joy with others.

Last year I got into the training programme for the job I thought I wanted. It was hard, really hard - but I thought it was worth it and if I just tried harder I could make it. I slowly started dating this boy I really, really liked. It was great.

And it all got harder. I gave up more and more to stay in the programme. I told him we shouldn't be seeing each other any more. I hated myself for it.

Concentrating on only the programme helped for a while. Then I got kicked out. I had given up everything I liked and wanted. I didn't think I'd ever like anything again.

I bounced back though.

Now I have a job I like, I'm good at it and I really like the people I work with. I hang out with my friends every night and all weekend - and I'm quitting all that to get my Master's degree. I'm so scared.

Suppose I don't like my classes, my professors, my class mates? Do I know how to study, how to take exams, how to write papers?

What if I get kicked out again?

Whatever happens, we will all be okay. And this is the best possible time.

Thank you all for writing. And for reading, of course.

Thank you Listserve, for introducing me to running. Tell me which podcasts to listen to while running! Do you have great study tips? Really, I could use them.

As I grew up I was told that you would grow apart from your high school friends. That connection would never be the same once you graduated and moved away. This rang true for several friendships but not my best friend. We had known each other since the 4th grade and me moving all over the place in pursuit of my dreams didn’t seem to affect our relationship one bit. We texted almost every day and could make each other laugh harder than anyone else in the world. When I would come home we could pick up right where we left off, sometimes in the middle of the same sentence.

She met a boy. I didn’t like him. I had hoped it was the over protective mother side of me flaring up. Or even the no one will ever be good enough for my best friend side of me. But it wasn’t. It was that primal gut instinct that drove our prehistoric ancestors to move into attack mode. I buried it. She was so happy and deserved to be happy, who was I to say he wasn’t up to par?

They broke up just before Thanksgiving, after almost a year together. I could finally lay it all out. All the reasons he wasn’t good enough. All the reasons she didn’t deserve to be treated the way she was. They got back together. They moved on. My words never left her. She knew how I felt about him and wouldn’t be able to forget that. She did her best to keep us apart. Which was easy because I had moved out of state.

The growing apart started. The texts became less and less. When I saw her at home we didn’t laugh nearly as hard. She seemed too adult for that now. They got engaged and I feigned excitement over the ring and the plans.

Three months before the wedding. I had picked out the bridal shower gift. I bought the plane tickets home for the big day. I was actively rehearsing my biggest most convincing smile when the phone rang. The wedding was off. He had been cheating on her. He had been hitting her. Everything my gut had told me about this man had come true.

It wasn’t growing up and apart. It was the isolation of an abuser. My best friend was missing and I didn’t even realize it. I have her back now and I feel guilty about how happy that makes me. I feel guilty that I didn’t miss her more. That I didn’t question more. That I accepted this fate thrust on to me by the people around me. You grow up and apart. In true friendships, true loving relationships you grow together. You add to each other’s lives every day, never take away. The best relationships are worth fighting for and I will never again be caught on the sidelines when it comes to one of my friends.

As a kid, my primary school teacher--a formidable American woman called Mrs James--forced all of us to learn this poem off by heart. As an eight year old I had no idea how this poem would worm its way back into my life decades later. 

I lived hard, worked long hours and punctuated my weeks with shopping and bar hopping in a busy Australian city. Still with all this I felt unhappy, dissatisfied and bored. Sure I was earning good money, had a great string of friends and lived in a city that is, to many, enviable but I was missing something. As I ambled down busy city streets reading the boredom in the faces of my fellow travellers I recalled the part of the poem which I had learned almost forty decades earlier: ""For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.""

This poem made me give it all up. I moved to the bush; seven hours from the nearest big city. I had to give up many of the comforts to which I'd become accustomed. Five years later. I wouldn't change a thing. I see the stars at night. The air is fresh. I have discovered that there is more to life than ""stuff"". 

Here's the poem ...

Clancy Of The Overflow

I had written him a letter which I had, for want of betterKnowledge, sent to where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago,He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,Just `on spec', addressed as follows, `Clancy, of The Overflow'.

And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,(And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)'Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote it:`Clancy's gone to Queensland droving, and we don't know where he are.'

In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of ClancyGone a-droving `down the Cooper' where the Western drovers go;As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,For the drover's life has pleasures that the townsfolk never know.

And the bush hath friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet himIn the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,And at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars.

I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingyRay of sunlight struggles feebly down between the houses tall,And the foetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty cityThrough the open window floating, spreads its foulness over all

And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattleOf the tramways and the 'buses making hurry down the street,And the language uninviting of the gutter children fighting,Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless tramp of feet.

And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid faces haunt meAs they shoulder one another in their rush and nervous haste,With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted forms and weedy,For townsfolk have no time to grow, they have no time to waste.

And I somehow rather fancy that I'd like to change with Clancy,Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons come and go,While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book and the journal --But I doubt he'd suit the office, Clancy, of `The Overflow'.

So much has been put underground with such contradictory or absent documentation that it is impossible to know what you will find in any potential hole. Which means that you have to dig carefully to not break any surprise pipes or subterranean infrastructure. This made city is so complex and layered that we have to treat it as a naturally occurring object to be explored, rather than as a made thing of known properties with attributes described in plans.

Web pages and emails and IM can seem kind of etherial, but they all run atop the Internet, and the Internet is a real thing. We made the Internet, bit by bit, but it is so big and intricate that we no longer understand it, if we ever did.

I have tried hard to understand it. I got a PhD in CS and wrote my dissertation on the Internet, in the hopes of finding out whether its growth has been healthy or not (""Measuring the Internet AS Graph and its Evolution"". Boothe, 2009). The short version is that from 2002 to 2010, its health stayed about the same, with18 ISPs pretty much always able to control ~45% of Internet traffic (and this was very hard to figure out).

After I wrote my dissertation I spent 5 years as a professor of computer science, teaching undergraduates. Now I work at Google and I will soon be involved in helping store Internet measurement data and making the data free for anyone and everyone to look at so that new people can come along and help us all understand this medium we are growing. I am really excited about this, because right now our knowledge of the Internet is based on hearsay and flimflam, rather than open measurements and well-described analysis. When you start with flimflam, it is almost impossible to guide growth non-randomly. For example, we now have multiple contradictory policies about network neutrality, and even disagreement about what those words mean.

When people worry about ""network neutrality"", their underlying fears are of monopoly control of the shared resource that is the Internet. Monopoly control would result in stunted growth and bad outcomes for everybody except the monopolist. This is part of why everyone you talk to means slightly different things when they say ""network neutrality"": they are worrying about symptoms of a problem, and enumerating all possible symptoms is impossible. Instead, we have to examine the growing body as it is and look to see if the body is healthy or if it is showing signs of disease. If there are symptoms, then we can look for root causes and hopefully fix the underlying problem.

I really care about the Internet, and I hope you do too. The Internet allows people to communicate with unprecedented ease. We have wrapped the world in wires and allowed communication to flow so cheaply that we take it for granted. It's not perfect, but it has enabled us to feel closer to one another and come together as a species more than anything else I know. Although the pieces are built, the whole is grown, and we must monitor this growth to make sure the Internet stays healthy. 

As long as we can talk to one another, there's still hope for us.

In the last few years I have gone through really very challenging and NOT so beautiful  times, like many of you here, and reading all your emails has become a morning coffee habit, which in turn, supported the so-called “healing process”.

Currently, I am at a point in my life, where I enjoy everything that comes my way. Is this a “rise from the ashes like a Phoenix bird” moment? I have NO freaking clue, but it feels just right!

And I wish everybody had the inner resources to bounce back so epic awesomely like I did.*motivational part ends here*

Now off we go with the funny stuff. :DWhere you all, dear friends, get back to me, with your dreams, experiences, likes and dislikes and, obviously, with the mandatory bitching stuff you feel you need to share, but you didn’t dare. Well, here I am… the finest ear you have never had… ready to listen to you.

What? What? More about me? ABSOLUTELY! :D

In one go: Books, movies, music, theatre, ballet, opera, memes, social networking, Dexter, Dr Who, Star Wars, Nightwish, Mozart, Criminal Minds, Downton Abbey, GoT (duhh!), Fringe, Zafon, Marquez, X-Files, Queen…(please somebody stop me)…Revenge, Stephen King, The Mentalist…ok, I will stop...Promise!

Wait a second…I also write stories from time to time on my blog.I also kept a dooms day diary on my second blog.And I tweet. A lot.

Still not satisfied? Question then:Name ONE book you would take away (if you go to live on Mars) with you as your most precious treasure?

Based on your answers, I will make a top ten of your preferences and post it on my Facebook page dedicated to books. Seriously! The listservians' voice needs to be heard in as many places as possible.

Awesome stuff about Romania, the country I come from:

We have one of the happiest cemeteries on Earth. The crosses are colorful (do you like blue?) and each tombstone features a witty poem depicting a person’s life and the way she or he died.To be continued in our future conversations…Feel free to connect with me wherever you feel more comfortable (email, Twitter, etc).

Thank you for taking precious time to read my thoughts and, as I said, waiting for you…

And even at hour 40, I still haven’t chosen a specific topic.It might be due to my strong indecisiveness (probably) or the fact that when you're given infinite possibilities, you don't want to pick just one.

But this process has only proven and accentuated one of my biggest faults.

I think, too much.

There’s so much to write yet so little time. It got to the point where I considered not writing anything at all. Why waste your time and mine?

But what’s worse: Giving up without anyone knowing or trying and putting yourself out there?

Thankfully, my answer was trying.

It hasn’t always been that answer. And if you were to step into my shoes right now, there are still plenty of things in my life where I need to ask myself that exact same question. Or I’ve answered the question but have not done much towards it.

But this is another step of many to go. And I’m hoping it’s only a jumping point to keep going forward.

In the end, at least I tried.

Ps. If you have something in your life where you need to ask yourself the same question, feel free to share! Would love to hear from any of you.

I’ve sat with clients while they’ve received devastating news from home, I’ve explained to clients that you cannot bathe in public pools, how to take a drug test, that you cannot kill and eat ducks at the park. I’ve helped buy cars and first homes, I’ve seen clients and coworkers become citizens and their children graduate high school and go off to college.  I’ve been invited to weddings and funerals of friends and strangers.

I’ve gotten to experience a lot through my work and I will always be appreciative.

However, life moves in stages and this may all be drawing to a close. I’ve never been someone with a singular passion and focus, and although I love what I do, it’s limiting in many ways.

Never be afraid to take that next step, to pursue the bigger things you want, to be true to the person you know you are. Sometimes you will need to let go of some things you love in order to make room for more. And that’s okay.

It was electric. We danced. We smoked. It felt like we’d known each other forever. His wife was jealous, she didn’t like me. I was young and naïve she said. I was just making a scene she said.  My bozo fiancé didn’t care, he didn’t even notice. He just drank whisky and had a good time. They left. I didn’t see him for a long time after that.

Bozo and I invited him to come party with us one night. I was drunk. Bozo was somewhere else. I made my intentions clear to him that night – I grinded on him and he stood there and grinned.

He wanted more, but I got cold feet. He’s married! I’m about to be married! Heck, I was even at his wedding! No, we can’t. Bozo later tells me that things were getting ugly between him and his wife. They drifted apart, and he drifted into psychosis. A mania fuelled by his music.

It was frantic. It was crazy. It hurt. He sang of unrequited love and of being as dirty as sin. He recorded a demo, and sought feedback from Bozo. So he came to our party. We drank. We flirted.  We moved the party into our beautiful city so we could dance the night away.

My bozo fiancé drank too much. Suddenly he’s gone home. No goodbye. No explanation. It’s just me and his friends. Perfect!

We conspired. We schemed. We wanted to dance, so we left his boring friends. We never looked back. It was just him and me. The man with the wife, and the girl with the fiancé.

We walked up the steps. BANG! It was a mass of sweaty gyrating people. Yes! We danced to Bowie. We smoked clove cigarettes. We choke-danced to Death in Vegas. We drank Jägermeister. The energy between us was like stars exploding. We smoked some more. He leaned in. I leaned in. And we kissed, as though nothing could fall.

Last drinks were called and we hit the streets. We walked and came to the park that overlooked the bridge. It was beautiful. We kissed. We fell deep and strong for each other.

It’s six in the morning. No key to get into Bozo’s house. He’d be too drunk to answer my call. Fuck it, it’s cold, can I crash at yours?!

The cab ride was over as quickly as it had begun. Driving away from Bozo was surreal. We’re in his house now. Pictures of wife on the mantle. We sit down. He takes a tablet, I take off my belt and kick off my boots.

He looks at me with those green eyes. And we kiss. And we fuck. Though, something’s wrong - he’s asleep! A sleeping tablet?! That was enough to wake me up! What have I done! I just cheated on Bozo. I leave him sleeping on the couch. I sleep in their marital bed.

I wake. I feel sick. What did I just do?! I told myself I would never be that type of girl again. He comes into their room. He slides into their bed and kisses my forehead. He tells me it’s going to be ok. And I believed him.

And it has been. After such a wild courtship I never knew love could be like this. All encompassing. Never feeling alone. Home is wherever he is.

It has been ten crazy years filled with music, fun, food, and now a beautiful little baby girl. I love you BKMB, always and forever.

Music:The Blisters, favorite songs: 21st Century Gang, One DayBrighton, MA, favorite songs: Touch, Wake the Dead

Pizza:If you're in Chicago, order from JB Alberto's in Rogers Park - my favorite is a thin crust  with roast beef and giardiniera, essentially an Italian Beef pizza.If you're into Chicago-style pizza, Mr. Gilberti's Place in Hollister, Missouri is the best Chicago-style pizza I've ever had.

Recipes:

I've been on a bit of a health kick lately and this has been a staple. From the American Heart Association:

Fish Tacos

2 - 4oz tilapia fillets1 tbsp fresh lime juice1/2 tsp chili powder1/2 tsp garlic powder1/2 tsp onion powder1/4 tsp salt2 small plum tomatoes1 jalapeno pepper1 green onion2 tbsp cilantro3 tbsp yellow cornmeal2 tsp olive oil8 corn tortillas

1. Sprinkle the fish with the lime juice, combine the spices in a bowl and rub over the fillets, refrigerate for 30 mins.2. Combine the tomatoes, pepper, onion and cilantro in a food processor for 15 seconds. Refrigerate until needed.3. Coat the fillets in the cornmeal, shake off the excess. Coat a skillet with olive oil, cook the fillets over medium high for 5 minutes a side.4. To serve, heat the tortillas, quarter the fillets, add one quarter of a fillet to each tortilla and a spoonful of the salsa. Makes 8 tacos. 1 serving is 2 tacos (173 calories).

 ...But when I need to carbo-load, this is delicious. Slightly modified from the tasting table website:

Purple Noodles

1½ lbs broccoli1 lb spaghetti1 bottle (750 ml) red wine1 tbsp sugar⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil2 tsp thinly sliced garlic (about 4 cloves)¼ tsp red-pepper flakes1 tsp salt½ tsp freshly ground black pepper½ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli and cook for 3 minutes or until just tender. Transfer the broccoli to a baking sheet and let cool. In the same boiling water, cook the spaghetti, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. (The pasta will finish cooking in the wine.) Reserve 1 cup of the pasta water and then drain the pasta and set it aside. Return the empty pasta pot to the stove.2. Add the wine and sugar to the pasta pot. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until reduced by half, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the pasta and shake to prevent the pasta from sticking. Gently stir with tongs until coated and boil over high heat, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed and the pasta is al dente, about 4 to 5 minutes.3. While the pasta cooks in the wine, heat a large, deep skillet over high heat. Add the olive oil, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the garlic until golden, about 3 minutes. Add the broccoli, red-pepper flakes, salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add ½ cup of the reserved pasta water, or more if desired, and stir to combine.4. Add the broccoli mixture to the pasta pot, toss gently and transfer to a platter. Sprinkle with the cheese and serve.

Hope you enjoy. Have a great day.

Here are some tips:-Keep it simple in terms of what you want to accomplish and what you carry. Shoot for one night out when you expect good weather, and plan to make camp within a few miles of the trailhead.-Enjoy yourself. Backpacking can be hard work, so take breaks. Admire nature. Appreciate the fresh air. Savor good views and the way the sky changes color when the sun is setting.-Wear comfortable shoes and clothes. A pair of sneakers from your closet will be sufficient for most intro-level hiking trails. Wear clothes that dry quickly and that don’t chafe - think gym shorts and polyester shirt. No need to invest in technical clothing at this point, but steer clear of cotton.-If you don’t need it, leave it. Especially for your first trip, lighter is better. I learned this the hard way by carrying books, too much extra clothing, a hatchet, complicated multi-tools, a gps unit, cumbersome chairs, unnecessary ropes, fancy cooking equipment, etc. Granted, it’s hard to know what you’ll need, but when in doubt you probably don’t need the item.-Cook light. There are a lot of great websites with recipes for simple backpacking meals, search “freezer bag cooking” and you will find them. Consider an Esbit or other solid-fuel stove and metal mug for preparing a hot meal before spending a lot more money on a more complicated, heavier cook kit. Less to carry, less to clean. Some backpackers leave the kitchen at home and get their calories from protein bars. I prefer carrying a small stove to have the pleasure of hot coffee on cold mornings. I budget 1.5 lbs. for food per person per day. That’s a lot by some standards. 2-3 lbs of nutritionally dense dry food per person per day will be more than enough.-Camp light. For warm weather trips, opt for the lighter tent and sleeping bag. Borrow them, or if necessary, rent these items from your local retailer or online. If you’re feeling adventurous, plan to sleep under the stars without a tent, perhaps bringing a tarp or heavy duty trash bags as backup in case it rains. Learn how to rig a tarp by searching “tarp camping.” Trash bags can also serve as emergency rain protection - search “trash bag poncho.” You’ll want a light sleeping pad, perhaps a repurposed yoga mat.-Water is important. Being dehydrated is no fun. Research water conditions before you go, or pack in enough to get you through the trip. The most common ways to treat raw water are boiling, chemicals, and filtering. Water sourcing and treatment is something worth consideration before you hit the trail.-Practice LNT. That stands for Leave No Trace. Seven guiding principles here: Plan ahead and prepare. Travel and camp on durable surfaces. Dispose of waste properly. Leave what you find. Minimize campfire impacts (and make sure you check the fire regulations). Respect wildlife. And be considerate of other visitors.

If you’re new to backpacking please feel free to email me any questions you might have. If you’re a veteran have any favorite tips or tricks, please do share. And I’d love to hear about your favorite backcountry campsite in Coastal or Northern California if you have one.

Happy trails!

August 2014,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/08/06/rift/,"August 2014, 06",Rift,"Some things I have been thinking about recently:

I never realized how brave firefighters are until I saw them with my own eyes entering a burning building and appearing in the windows where smoke was gushing out.  

I have been making decision lately on the belief that life is about new experiences.  The more different things you do, places you visit, and people you meet, the more interesting, educated, and understanding you become.  Which brings me to my third thought:

Being proved wrong can be a good thing.  I have always lived near New York City, but my enjoyment of open space and a view of the stars without light pollution always kept me wary of this place.  How foolish I was!  The people you encounter and places you discover in this city and others like it are what keep life interesting, and I am glad that my views have changed. 

About me:  I am a college student studying business and journalism and I love to surf.    If you have any recommendations on places to see great music in NYC or Dublin, shoot me a message!

Make today great, and whatever you do, take care of your shoes.

Everything you’re reading now was written before I was selected to share a message with the Listserve community. Like many of you, as soon as I signed up, I began wondering what I would say if given the chance. Some weeks later, I began to wonder how that message might be different if I were writing it on the assumption that it would never be read versus writing with certainty that it would. So I sat down to write a message, this message, even before I was asked to, which also means that you can think of this as the only email written from the perspective of a non-winner of the Listserve lottery.

Part One – Just Gonna Say It…

I’m a generally happy, positive person, but I’m also a proud skeptic, a natural contrarian, a sometimes pessimist, and an occasional grump. I tell you this because I don’t want what follows to be read as insulting or critical of the Listserve project or any of the contributors – I look forward to the emails every day, even and especially those furthest from my ideological, philosophical or religious standpoint. All that being so, I’m just gonna say it: The deluge of positive messages is becoming one bright, shiny, happy blur, with no real weight or influence on my life in general or my days individually. I have grown numb to the wise and elegant words. I care little about the thoughtful, personal epiphanies, and I wonder if others have had the same experience. It strikes me as an interesting phenomenon, perhaps demonstrating the notion that you can have too much of a good thing. It’s also worth mentioning that I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be writing this if I knew I’d been selected; that is, I imagine I’d get bright and shiny and happy real quick if I knew this were being sent to 20,000+ people.

Part Two – Shameless Self-Promotion

[Part Two deleted, explanation below]

Part Three – ?

I’m reserving part three in case I’m actually picked, meaning anything that follows was written after I was selected:

Written 07/29/2014:

$#@%, I was actually selected?!

Reflections on Part One –

            First thought… I wish I hadn’t made this deal with myself. My message suddenly feels so negative and petty, like I was belittling something just because I couldn’t have it, and my impulse now is to get “bright and shiny and happy.” At the same time, I can’t say what I wrote has proven untrue, just that my relationship to Listserve has evolved. First was the honeymoon phase, when every message was amazing. Then I began taking it for granted (around the time I wrote part one), but finally I settled into something like a long-term relationship. The value of the messages in my day-to-day life is not quite what it was, and sometimes I hardly notice them for weeks, but it’s still appreciated, comforting. And, every once in a while, out of nowhere, I am amazed.

Reflections on (the now deleted) Part Two –

            Here’s where I was going to disregard the rule against self-promotion and plug my novel-in-progress. Turns out rules are easier to break in theory. Now I can’t bring myself to do it because it feels like an insult to both the spirit and the readers of the Listserve. (What I will do is invite you to write me if you’d like to read a sample and offer feedback/book deals.)

Finally, because I haven’t hit exactly 600 words, some recommendations:

My name is Ryan. I'm 38 years old. I live in Canada.

In the last three months I have quit my import craft beer job in Vancouver - after three years with the company, moved all of my belongings into my brother's garage on Vancouver Island, taken a month-long solo camping road trip down the west coast and across the states, come back to my hometown of London, Canada, to help out my folks with their dog kennel business over the busy summer, while they tend to elderly relatives, spent most of my free evenings enjoying the sunsets on Lake Huron, and in the last two weeks met an amazing girl who I just might fall in love with if I'm not careful...

What a long strange trip it's been.

My dad died when I was 14. I moved out when I was 16. I've spent the last 20 years moving all over, living in different places, couch-surfing, working different jobs, making music and art, and experiencing different people and places. Always searching. An artist is always in a state of becoming. One thing I have learned is that no matter where you go and or who you are, everyone has a story -- their own dreams and pains.

I've worked so many different jobs, and experienced so many different types of living… I've been a bicycle delivery person, busboy, worked in a jeans shop, waiter, bartender, worked in a dog kennel, concert promotion, music journalist, television host, dishwasher, worked for a drug dealer (not proud of that one, but I was desperate, and it was only for a few weeks), managed bars, worked in craft beer industry, been an actor and a touring musician, magazine editor, the list goes on...

I've done cocaine in limos with rock stars and I've slept on the ground and panhandled for change to get a slice of pizza -  I've gone back and forth between these extremes a few times... I've battled through crippling depression, self-medicated for years with alcohol and drugs, and nowadays am living clean and finding happiness and peace with healthy smoothies and running and yoga. These experiences have taught me not to judge anyone. The guy sorting through my recycling bin for empties is no different than the guy driving by him in his big car wearing an expensive suit. I know this because, to some degree, I've been bits of both of them.

These days I am living a quiet life. I want to buy a little piece of land near water, build a cabin, and spend as much time as possible painting, writing, walking with my dogs, and hopefully raising a couple kids with a cool lady.

I hope you all feel loved in your lives today. If not, I'm sending a little love you way… :)

I have my unique take on these issues -- some which I have expressed on my own pages and feeds.

But I'm not going to talk about that here.

Just about eight years ago (August 1, 2006) my mom died suddenly. It was a shock to everyone.  I grew up in a traditional Jewish household emphasizing a strong Jewish education and had learned about the process and rituals surrounding death, burial and mourning. But I hadn't experienced it so closely until then.  There was the tearing of a necktie I wore which my mom liked.  The visitors during the first seven days of mourning (shiva). The walk around a pond I took with my Dad at the end of that week. And the following eleven months of gathering with the community to recite the Mourner's Kaddish, a prayer with which I became all too familiar.

""I should write a book about these experiences,"" I thought. And I started to do just that.  A (slightly humorous) chronicle of blog posts of this year-long journey following my mother's passing, explaining the Jewish rituals I was experiencing for the first time. I never finished that book. 

Fast forward a few years: I had met a blogger named Faiqa who wrote passionately about her life as an American Muslim woman. The way she would explain the rituals and beliefs of her religion and culture were so interesting. And, at times, funny. I approached her -- telling her that it would be amazing to collaborate on a book where we could share our own traditional experiences in our own quirky ways.

We decided to form a weekly podcast.  ""Hey! That's My Hummus!"" got its name from the subject of our first episode -- which dealt with a conflict between student groups over a boycott of a brand of hummus being sold on campus. It wasn't the first time that Jewish and Muslim groups on a college campus (or anywhere else) had butted heads, nor would it be the last.  But it was something which we could discuss light-heartedly as friends.  Over the following 75 episodes, we talked about issues from our own vantage points -- whether they dealt with our religious and cultural practices or wereripped from the headlines that week.  (We somehow spent a lot of time talking about Justin Bieber.)

This was truly a learning experience for the both of us as we had both experienced some avoidance between our two religious groups in the past.  Perhaps it was a knee-jerk reaction figuring that we'd fundamentally disagree from the start and that it would be best for us to simply tiptoe around any interaction.  But in our collaboration, we both learned so much about the values each other held dear. It certainly opened my eyes to new possibilities.

As far as I know, our podcast hasn't produced world peace (yet).  That can't happen with simply one Jewish guy and one Muslim woman talking on a weekly basis. But it stresses that we ARE just people with our own stories and experiences. It's easy to generalize about ""us"" and ""them"" -- especially when groups are in conflict with each other. Only when we take that next step and think of each other as individuals -- that's when we can truly see progress.

You can do a web search on the podcast. Or, even better, come up with your own. Form a new relationship with another individual.

I joined The Listserve exactly one week ago.  And I'm not really ready for my turn.  This feels like a speech for an Academy Award with the music already playing me off stage…

But here is part of my life…

I almost jumped from a bridge in April of 2010.  It probably wouldn't have killed me – but I wanted to die.  Instead of dying, I moved to Hawai'i and worked at a summer camp.  And I fell in love with wonderful kids and wonderful co-workers.  They truly saved my life.

My favorite person there was a girl named Teej Teasdale.  A writer from Kenya who worked with me and then later moved to the middle of the Pacific Ocean – Micronesia – to work for the Peace Corps.  A girl with a heart big enough to hold the entire world [and all its pain].  She saved my life more than once.  But she took her own life last July.  It's still intensely painful.  And I can't really speak about her in the past tense like she's gone.  She is still beautiful and wonderful and talented and compassionate.  Death can't take that away from her.  And she continues to change me for the better.  You can find her poetry by searching 'masikanicrocodile' on Google.  [Side note: my great-aunt once heard us talking about Google and asked, ""Who's Google?"" – Aunt Mary is the best…]

Near the end, Teej wrote me a poem titled, ""Prologue to a 20-Volume Suicide Note.""  But I was 4,808 miles away and couldn't drive across the Atlantic to hug her.  [""Transatlanticism"" is playing in my mind right now…]  But after she died, I wrote my own 20-volume suicide note – the long, sad, boring soundtrack to an unfinished screenplay.  It's all I could stand to do with passion.  You can find it by searching 'markusaurelius' on Bandcamp.  All proceeds go to GiveWell, a good charity.  I don't mean to be self-promotional but I do promote giving to others – I heard that people who are given five dollars to spend on others have happier days than those given five dollars to spend on themselves.  So the money isn't for me, and I wouldn't want it anyway.  ""A sprig or mint by the wayward brook; a nibble of birch in the wood; a summer day and love and a book; and I wouldn't be king if I could…""

I've spent too much of my last few years feeling sadness but here are some of the things making me happy…

I am happy that I found my new home in Florence, Italy – a city I discovered by pure chance… a city I love deeply.  I am happy about the friends and family in my life.  I am happy that my parents are living happy lives.  I am happy that my uncle, the son of Charles Hamilton Houston, spent hours telling me stories of his life yesterday – listening is one of my favorite things.  I am happy that I met a girl, Anna, who is so beautiful and so wonderful and so kind and so GOOD that I can't help but feel more whole when I am near her.  Or even when I hear her voice.  Or even when I see a picture of her.  Or even when I see her in my dreams.  I'm starting to think that… she is my dream.

Okay – I'm almost out of words.  I can hear the music playing me off…

Thank you to Winnie the Pooh, Tim, and everyone I’ve ever loved.  And especially those who have ever loved me.

Love, love, and more love.

July 2014,31,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/07/31/dont-die-peacefully/,"July 2014, 31",Don't Die Peacefully,"I owe it to my dad for introducing me to motorcycles; my first motorcycle experiences were riding around my town on the back of my his Harley. Now that he’s diagnosed with cancer, our Sunday rides have become rare, but I know that he will overcome it (He’s already planning his three-month motorcycle trip along the Silk Road (which stretches from India to China)). This Listserve is dedicated to my passion for motorcycles, but more importantly, my dad who has been a very important role model.            I will never forget the first time I took my own bike on to the actual road and felt that tire kiss the asphalt. I remember myself grinning ear to ear, tearing up in the corners of my eyes, amazed at what I was doing. My heart raced and my body was tense, yet my conscience was relaxed. Even on my first ride, functioning the bike felt natural, like it was meant to be. It was almost like my life was completed, even though I had the rest of my life ahead of me. Riding a motorcycle is like a roller coaster but better. Like driving in a convertible with the top down on a nice summer day, but better. It’s like getting an A on an essay, like landing that first date with a girl you’re interested in, like hot chocolate after playing in the snow for hours, but better. There is nothing holding you back when you drive a motorcycle.            Owning a motorcycle is not a matter of life or death. It is much more than that. Its a definitional moment when you ride; who are you going to be, what are you going to do, how are you going to do it?  If you've never ridden, it’s hard to comprehend what I am saying; but once you try it, I can guarantee you will be hooked for life. Everything that is felt is enhanced. Your sense of smells, sights, and feelings are stimulated to such an extreme that even the familiar seems strange. The smells surround you like a gentle mist of aromas. Everything that passes by tickles the sinuses. The smell of lilies, streams, trees, and fields of wheat are euphoric. At the same time, the bike is like the extension of your body. It’s almost as if you’re dancing in between cars. You move back and forth, this way then that way, and everything is in harmony - ground, bike, and self.            Why do I ride? It’s the thrill, the danger. But more importantly, it’s a connection to my dad. A short documentary I recently watched (I can provide a link upon request) perfectly sums up why I ride. It goes something along the lines of: Every time you climb on your bike and turn the engine on, you do not know whether you will be arriving to your destination safely. But you cannot let the fear of death stop you from doing things you love. We are only here for a while, and we are the sum of our experiences; our experiences, our memories all tends to blend together if we don’t punctuate it with some adventure. Years can slip by pretty fast. What did you do?            Feel free to reach out to me for that link or to talk. Also, if anyone has advice for a current sophomore in college, who is Pre-med/Majoring in Environmental Science, I would really appreciate it. Cheers!

YELLOW - The morning I learnt that it was my turn to write for Listserve, we were having a long discussion with my family on how their past years of poverty has affected us (I got a sister and a brother) as kids. We cried together. I had a bedwetting problem until starting high-school. My sister got married at her 19. (We are both OK now, she has three wonderful kids)

2. PURPLE - Since the day I realized that I have a younger look than my peers and I will never have beards, my biggest challange has started: Not letting others define my character with their words/looks  on how I look. (classic modern story)

3. TRANSPARENT - I belive that we people are destined to live with a misconception of ourselves no matter how hard we try. -This is something I discovered during my Sociology master.- Maybe that’s why I prefer “loving” to “understanding” or I belive “to understand” is only for “to love”

4.BLUE - I am an English teacher in a suburb of  İstanbul. -Between “to educate” and “to be a good example” I would definitely bet on the latter.-  My students (7th and 8th graders) love visitors in the classroom. If you ever happen to visit the city you are always welcomed in my English class. Just e-mail me. I have a million membered Facebook page, Learn English -the one with the colourful monsters on its profile- and I dont know why I am sharing this with you guys. Sorry.

5. WHITE / PINK / WILD STRAWBERRY / RED - And the biggest news!!!!! I am getting married with the girl I am in love in 5 days. :) She is adorable and I already owe so much to her. I love her. I love to discover the meanings of things in her soul.

Could you help me surprising her, please, please, please??? I am preparing a photo slide for her and I just need a photo of you -or someone you know- holding a paper/carton with a short note (Congradulations etc.) and our names on it, Süheyla & Mehmet… It will NOT go online... We will -hopefully- find a good way to thank you afterward.

6. ORANGE - I have made a wedding website in 3 hours with no coding and stuff on wordpress. That’s a part of the surprise for her. If you can’t write a book, you can make a website.

7. GREEN - Plant trees.

Best regards.

Thanks.

(Now, I wonder if I get my own e-mail) :)

I'll share a story.

We'd been drinking all night. We were in university, working for the student newspaper, and we drank in bars with wood paneled walls.

I walked him home; it was on my way and I was happy just to be close to him. It had to end when we reached his door.

Instead of going inside he leaned in, hugged me to him, and kissed me. His stubble burned my lips. He pulled back, and asked if it was ok; sounding almost afraid. It was.

As a boy who'd resigned himself to the idea that no boy would ever love him back that moment was a fulcrum for many changes in the way I saw and lived my life.

Best.  Alex Ottawa, Canada"

I was fourteen and didn’t know how to ask for what I needed. Twelve years on, I’m in therapy and still fighting the urge to hurt myself – not daily, but more than I’d like.

Being in and stepping out of an emotionally, sexually and psychically  - in that order - abusive relationship. I never found that strength in myself again, and will be forever grateful to the boy who triggered it in me back then.

Learning to drink coffee. It gives me calm and comfort on weekend mornings.

Going to journalism school, which I dreamed about all through my five years of university and way before that. It opened a whole new world to me: suddenly I needed to do things, see the world, write!, after five years of sitting in benches, listening and taking notes. It made my love for writing and reading even bigger, and was a dream I would have blamed myself forever for not pursuing it.

Music. Indulging me in it from the very beginning of my life is one of the few things I am my parents truely grateful for.

Being left by my best friend because he’d rather not be with me all than be with me his love unanswered.

Joining a youth movement, which taught me valuable things like engagement and teamwork, but which also confirmed yet again what I already knew by then: making friends is not my strong suit (to say the least).

The psychiatric problems in my close family, and mostly: that we never talked about it. I was thirteen, heard my sister crying all the time, saw the fear in my mother’s eyes, and had to make up my own story.

My most recent ex- and most serious boyfriend ever. He taught me things, he inspired me, he cared for me when I didn’t care for myself, he supported me, he gave me a home, he made me a better me.

Take care,

PS Do you happen to know a good cure for chronic urticaria? I'd love to try it.

I was traveling in the Delhi metro, when I bumped into a ragged, shabby looking kid wearing half pants. He fell on the platform and scraped his knees. I happened to have a Band Aid handy so I bandaged his wound and set upon my way. 3 stations out, I realized that my phone had been nicked. I immediately ran back to the boarding station with the intention of reporting the theft. As I was heading towards the police booth, someone tapped me on my hand and said to me in Hindi, ""Here's your phone. My knees have been bleeding since morning. Although I have nearly a lakh rupees ($1700) worth of phones in my pocket, I can't really afford a Band Aid. Good Day"".

Karma is a bitch. A soft cuddly one in this case. Puts things in perspective doesn't it?

I am Hem, 25 years of age. If anyone is coming down to Delhi anytime soon, hit me up and I would love to show you around/swap stories over a pint of beer. Or just write to me. I love to meet new people and would love to hear from anyone who would like a penpal :) I also play in a band called ""The Purple Jays"". We are writing an album which will be out by November this year. Head out to our Facebook page and stay tuned for updates :)

July 2014,26,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/07/26/music-and-movies/,"July 2014, 26",Music and Movies,"I'll start with the basics.  I am married with two kids living in Minneapolis after moving here from Northern CA.   I work part time as a Piano Instructor at a community college.  Since you are now all my captive audience, I've decided to write on my favorite composers and some of their pieces.   ??  In other words a real snooze fest.  BUT as an added bonus I will give you a list of the movies you should see because I like them.  It's a Twofer!   All the music is on YouTube so please do check it out.      Off we go..... Huzzah  ??

Dmitri Shostakovich is by far my favorite composer.  His music is complicated and intense.   That is the beauty in Shostakovich's music in my opinion.   His Symphony Number 10, Second Movement is fast, crazy, loud and awesome.  He wrote this symphony when Stalin had just died and it is not a homage to Stalin, but a F*ck You to him.  Poor Shosty was not well liked in the Party.   I would also recommend his Symphony Number 15 (his last one) as well.  Some of the very snobby music historians don't think highly of it as he was by then starting to lose it.  But check it out just to hear the Factory type sounds he tried to convey.  There's tons more of his music but I wanted to start off slowly and you can keep listening.....He is the best.

Okay, I don't have a favorite movie, but wanted to suggest so nicely to either keep watching or start watching the Marx Brothers.  The ones that stand out are Duck Soup (Margaret Dumont - so great),  A Night at the Opera  and Day at the Races.  If you have never watched them before and happen upon one, avoid any of the movies newer than say 1941 or so.   My other 'likes' with comedies are any Laurel and Hardy or Buster Keaton.  BTW, fav recent movie is Eastern Promises.  I don't know what one can read into that.

To end, I wanted to say a thank you for the ListServe site for putting this all together.  I've had fun reading many of the others and actually had fun with this one.      Peace    Beth

I was having a horrible morning. Remember how your prepubescent classmates treated the substitute teacher when you were a kid? Well, I was now THAT teacher. Needless to say, I was attempting to keep the class under control but struggling to do so. I knew that if I was to make it through the afternoon I needed a coffee. At lunch, I drove to a plaza about 10 minutes away and got my caffeine fix. As I approached my car, I suddenly realized that my keys were locked inside. Ugh. As was my cell phone. Ugh again. Panicked and desperate, I hurried into a nearby McDonald’s and approached the man at the counter (who turned out to be the manager) and asked him if he could call me a cab. I briefly explained my situation and I could tell from his expression that he sympathized with my desperation. I was a little beyond stressed at this point. When you are substitute teaching, you are basically trying to make the best impression possible on every principal and school you go to in the hopes that they will like you and that you may be one step closer to landing a full time gig. Not showing up after lunch or being late would put you in their bad books. So the manager hurried to the back to call me a cab while I paced the restaurant. The clock was ticking. I had about 10 minutes until the bell rang. I debated running but it being winter and likely a long and icy jog back, I wouldn’t make it in time. Several minutes later he returned only to tell me that the cab company had put him on hold and that he had then become disconnected. He was now back on hold again. No cab was coming yet. Crap!

I must have made some sort of terrified face because without hesitation he grabbed his coat and said “I will drive you”. So without a thought I followed him. In no time I was back at the school with only a couple of minutes to spare before the bell. I thanked this man endlessly for his kind gesture and to which he replied, “that’s what McDonald’s is for”. Not just the Big Mac I guess.

I think back to this day often and it makes me happy. Happy that a total stranger would care enough to help me out of a bind. I guess we may not be able to solve all the world’s problems in a day but we do have the power to put a smile on someone else’s face and make their day just a little bit brighter. And who knows, maybe one day that person will write a listserve entry about you!

I am now a full time teacher living in Toronto and I share this story with my wee ones every year. It’s simply kindness.

Thank you for reading.

I am afflictedby what is likely the most amazing affliction possible, wanderlust.  Iam fascinated & fixated on exploring this planet as often as possible.Being able to see & experience places that are vastly different fromwhere I've lived puts everything in a new perspective.  You learn toappreciate what you have, or to realize that there are better ways ofdoing things.  You understand why some places are the way they are, orlearn that some parts of the world defy understanding.  Travelling tonew & unfamiliar places makes you a better person.

I know that not everyone has the means to travel to distant lands.But you don't need to.  Sometimes going somewhere unfamiliar meansdriving for a few hours to a place that is unlike where you live(different scenery, different culture, different language, etc).  Orgo hiking & explore a forest, desert, beach, or grassland that you'venever seen up close before.  Wander to a new part of your town or citythat you've never been to before, or get on a public bus, subway, oreven a taxi, and check out a part of your city, province, state orregion that is unfamiliar to you.  Just go somewhere that is new, andtake it all in.  Additionally, travelling does not have to be a groupactivity.  While there are benefits to travelling with one or morefriends or loved ones, travelling solo has its own rewards & benefits.Sure, it requires some more courage, it can put you much further outof your comfort zone, but in the end, you'll learn more about yourself(and if you learn that you simply hate travelling alone, that'sworthwhile knowing from experience too).

My favorite/recommended travel destinations:* South Korea: China & Japan get a lot of the hype & buzz, but thissmall nation is amazing.  The people are friendly, the culture isinteresting, and the food is delicious* Estonia: western Europe gets all the attention, but this ex-Sovietera country is quirky, fascinating & fun* Australia: I spent a month, a year ago, driving a campervan over9000km all around, and had the most amazing time.  Its a huge place,with so much to see & experience* Tanzania: my first experience in Africa, and I'm yearning to return.Its wild, wonderful & unlike what most expect

Where to next?  Oman & Dubai in September, quite likely Cambodia inJanuary, and I'm hoping to get to Antarctica in December of 2015.  Ifyou've been to any of these places already, please share your tips,warnings, & recommendations (places to see, sleep or eat, people tomeet, etc).

Almost as much as I love to travel, I enjoy hearing about otherpeople's travels.  The next best thing to going somewhere new, ishearing about your adventures.  I'd love to hear from any of you witha great travel story:* Where have you gone that absolutely amazed you (and why)?* Where have you gone that didn't live up to the expectations (and why)?* If you have photos of your travels online somewhere, I'd love to seethem.  Even better if there are stories to go with them.

When I'm not seeing the world, I'm an engineer at a Silicon Valleytech company.  Want to chat about anything?  I'm on twitter(@netllama), or try simply googling for ""llama land linux-sxs""(without the quotes), and the first few results should point you to mywebsite.

I love my job because of my students, who are kind, thoughtful, and unthinkably resilient kids who all want a satisfying and stable life. The biggest obstacle between my students and success is literacy. Without strong reading and writing skills, graduation and college admission become impossible dreams. To raise literacy, we need an enormous supply of engaging, diverse texts, a library where any student can find a book that they can't put down. In the last year, I have worked non-stop to build the only classroom library in our school, collecting from willing publishers, friends, and other schools. I'm happy to go anywhere I can in/near New York City to add even a book or two to our classroom, and the result has been a classroom already full of books, and a tenth-grade recognized by the school as an impressive cohort of independent readers.

There will never be enough books for my students - the more we can offer, the better our chances of getting every student, especially our reluctant readers, to find a story they love and invest in the reading they need to do well. So please, anything you can offer is deeply appreciated.

Anyone can help! Here are possible ways you could:

1. If you're in New York City and have even a book or two (or more!) that you think high schoolers might enjoy, e-mail me! I'm happy to come collect anything. If you are from out of town but interested, e-mail me and I will let you know when our next DonorsChoose project begins (hopefully in the next week).

2. Recommend books you think teenagers might like & tell me why. I spent a lot of the summer reading books in the hunt for ones that I know my kids will like.

3. Let me know about non-profits/organizations/people who might be able to assist. We have benefit hugely from organizations like First Book and the Cicero Project, and I'm sure there are other great places ready to give books to schools like us that I don't know about!

Anything is appreciated - take a moment to think about whether you can help us out! For the thousands of you not in New York City, if you (like my family) have shelves of books no one reads anymore, consider finding the school near you that wants them - there definitely is one!

Oranges by Gary Soto 

The first time I walkedWith a girl, I was twelve,Cold, and weighted downWith two oranges in my jacket.December. Frost crackingBeneath my steps, my breathBefore me, then gone,As I walked towardHer house, the one whosePorch light burned yellowNight and day, in any weather.A dog barked at me, untilShe came out pullingAt her gloves, face brightWith rouge. I smiled,Touched her shoulder, and ledHer down the street, acrossA used car lot and a lineOf newly planted trees,Until we were breathingBefore a drugstore. WeEntered, the tiny bellBringing a salesladyDown a narrow aisle of goods.I turned to the candiesTiered like bleachers,And asked what she wanted -Light in her eyes, a smileStarting at the cornersOf her mouth. I fingeredA nickle in my pocket,And when she lifted a chocolateThat cost a dime,I didn’t say anything.I took the nickle fromMy pocket, then an orange,And set them quietly onThe counter. When I looked up,The lady’s eyes met mine,And held them, knowingVery well what it was allAbout.

Outside,A few cars hissing past,Fog hanging like oldCoats between the trees.I took my girl’s handIn mine for two blocks,Then released it to letHer unwrap the chocolate.I peeled my orangeThat was so bright againstThe gray of DecemberThat, from some distance,Someone might have thoughtI was making a fire in my hands.

July 2014,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/07/19/outback-club/,"July 2014, 19",Outback Club,"Hey everyone,

I am writing to you from Mundrabilla Roadhouse in the outback of Western Australia. I’m a 27 year old from Ontario,Canada who’s been living in Australia on a working holiday visa for nearly two years now. While I have seen some incredible coastlines and met some incredible people I have chosen to write about my current situation which is at an extremely remote roadhouse along the Eyre highway.

For anyone that doesn’t know, this highway is the only route linking South Australia  to Western Australia. The Western Australia part of the highway is virtually treeless, flat, saltbush covered terrain that is practically unchanging. I am 13 hours inland from Adelaide and 16 hours inland from Perth. There are no towns out here, only roadhouses located about 100-200 kms apart from each other. Due to it’s remoteness some parts of the highway are even used as emergency airstrips for the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

In March, I decided I would spend 6 months of my last visa out here. My primary reason  to come out  was to cash up and set myself up for the next adventure. Out here you’ve got all kinds of money and no place to go. Our big nights out consist of driving to the next roadhouse to get lattes because we only have instant coffee or walking up the back of the property to get away from the sound of the generator and see some kangaroos and emus. Let’s be honest though, coffee isn’t everything, I do drink a fair bit of wine to keep things interesting.

Some days the silence, isolation and lack of social life really makes me wonder whether it’s  worth doing something you hate just for money? To be fair, I don’t hate it completely. It is such a unique experience relying on a generator for power and desalinated ground water to drink. You really do learn to live with the bare essentials and I’m happy with that aspect of it. We look forward to our toiletry orders coming every month as if it was some flash new toy. On the other hand I am doing simple, mindless work that really allows too much time for thinking. Thinking of the more beautiful aussie towns I could be in, thinking of what else I could be doing, thinking of the places I won’t get to see in Australia because I’ve committed so much time here. On a weekly basis you really go through a roller coaster of emotions which is the part that I hate.

There are about 10 of us out here, the family that own the business, a couple of managers, and then us, the workers, the backpackers that the roadhouse relies on to operate the business. Currently, there are 4 here: Helene, a lovely, young lass from France (whom I just introduced to the Listserve) Matt, our wannabe pommy from Perth and Bean, a pint sized art teacher from Taiwan. Without these guys I would have fled the scene long ago. We keep each other sane, I like to think so anyway. We all plan  to travel after so we constantly motivate ourselves to stick it out by chatting of the countless ways we are going to roam around Asia spending all our hard earned cash from Mundrabilla.

When it comes down to it, it is a great experience that I couldn’t get in Canada. Come say hi if you’re crossing the Nullarbor! Get in touch with any travel related stuff or anything that may keep me motivated out here for another 3 months!

Hope you’ve enjoyed my story.x

The deep, dark, melancholy chords layered with Paul Banks' voice is comforting to me. My favorite songs are ""The Lighthouse"" and ""Leif Erikson"".

I grew up in low income housing in the Lower East Side of New York City in the 80s. I've since moved to my own place but still live in the neighborhood. Things have gentrified quite a bit since then, with a trendy restaurant, bar, gallery, or boutique opening up every week. There's still a grittiness here that I hope doesn't wash away the cultural roots that have been laid down generations before.

My parents immigrated from China in 1978. When they arrived, they had no family, no friends, no money, no degree, didn't speak any English and had to feed my 4 year old sister.

They are the most unselfish, hard-working, and resilient people I know. They sacrificed everything so my sister and I could have a good life.  They're in their mid 60s now, and the other day my mom said that she was proud of me.

I like making lists and checking them off.

I love summer thunderstorms. I stand outside on my balcony while I watch the rain comes down in sheets, lightning strike in the distance, and thunder rolls above. I like the smell of wet grass and feeling the electric tension in the air.

I quit a career in Finance and traveled around the world. I rode camels in the Sahara, rapelled down a waterfall in Costa Rica, witnessed the Northern Lights in Norway, and ate some of the best damn food I've ever had in Istanbul. I'd like to see Australia, New Zealand and Iceland soon.

I now work at an online Dating Startup in NYC.

I've been in love before. I've also been infatuated before. I think I now know the difference.

I'm afraid of failure but I know it's all (mostly) in my head.

I read theSkimm, Quora, and Marc & Angel Hacks Life.

I love yoga. I picked it up after I split up with my ex of 4 years. It was a really tough and desolate time and I had to re-learn who I was and how to live by myself. The first time I felt peace was during Savasana, in a crowded, sweaty room full of yogis laying next to me, with the song ""Green Arrow"" from Yo La Tengo.

I believe that if you don't like your circumstances, you should try your best to change them instead of just complaining about them - if you can.

I don't know if I believe that everything happens for a reason. But I do know that sometimes things happen that you didn't want or expect, and learning to adapt is a survival skill.

Above all, I just want to be happy and healthy and wish everyone all the best. Kindness is catching.

From perfect celebrities on magazine covers to slender runway models, we hunger for beauty – or what we perceive as beauty.

My mother fights hard to stop me from wanting to change or alter my appearance. As a young teenager, I was not allowed to experiment with eye shadows or hair dye. I remember putting up (what was then) a convincing argument to be permitted to start shaving. I didn’t want my track and field teammates to make fun of my hairy legs anymore. I finally got my ears pierced right before freshman year of high school.

A little over a year ago, while living and working overseas in Southeast Asia, I was about 90% certain I wanted to get a tattoo. Though I was a recent college grad at the time (and feeling both independent and somewhat of a rebel), I still had the urge to consult my mom for her guidance. She told me it was my body, and I could do what I wanted with it. Needless to say, I left Indonesia tattoo-less. However, my aunt in the Philippines did convince me to get my hair chemically straightened (something I’m not proud of, as it has lasted for over fourteen months), as well as teach me the art of proper nail care.

Half a year ago, someone I was interested in dating told me I had to “apply maintenance” to my facial hair before he introduced me to his friends. I no longer to speak to him; no one should ever dictate my appearance. However, what he said triggered something else in me: a need to remind myself that I am beautiful in my own way. I started eating healthy and exercising five or six times a week. I became passionate about fitness, health and wellness. Strength – emotional, mental and physical – is important in order to truly be comfortable with who I am. Strong is the new sexy.

Perfection is an impossible feat to achieve. Today, I can count the number of times I’ve worn more than just eyeliner in the single digits. The only beauty products I’ve ever purchased are nail polish and lip balm. My idea of beauty may change as the years pass. But I know that through it all, if I am happy with who I am, the rest of the world better be as well.

I’m a writer and mental health advocate. If you would like to engage in further discussion on the perception of beauty, the importance of strength, or self-confidence, feel free to email me. Alternatively, you can find me on Twitter @mamatanap.

Stay beautiful!

July 2014,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/07/16/breakups/,"July 2014, 16",breakups,"I dated a girl in Canada for less than six months back in 2006. I still think about her all the time. I’m not sure if that has as much to do with her as it does with who I was at the time. I want to be that guy again.

Before that, I dated a girl, on and off, for about five years, maybe more. Neither of us was very serious about it, or so I thought. She made a point of telling me I wasn’t the one she was looking for, but in retrospect, I think she said that because she knew I felt that way. I think she felt more for me than I did and I wish I’d been mature enough at the time to see how wonderful she was to me. I still think about her a lot, and feel quite a bit of affection for her. She was a really good person. I think she’s happy now, and that makes me feel a little better.

During a longer break with the girl above, I had a short relationship with a girl who had two kids. They took me into their lives quickly and I became part of theirs. I enjoyed playing the family man, the surrogate dad, I could see myself staying there. I like to tell myself that I backed away because of her politics; she was far to the right of me, and her job as a police officer had made her, frankly, somewhat of a racist. The truth, however, is that I left her because she had a literal mountain of debt, and I knew that if I married her I was also marrying the debt.

At some point in all this I dated a girl who cheated on me. She was heavily into bondage, apparently just not with me.

Going back even further, I was married for ten years to a girl I met in college. It was enjoyable, although we argued too much. We kept finding reasons not to have any kids; money, jobs… that was for the best I guess. Things worked out for her, she remarried, had a kid, and seems happy.

Currently though, I’m staring down the barrel of 50, and married to a woman who hates me. I’m too fat, I don’t make enough money, and I’m mean. I’m sad, she’s always angry. I’m not sure what we’re going to do, maybe we’ll get divorced. I’m trying to get in better shape, make more money, be nicer… the last thing bothers me because none of the women above ever thought I was mean. Even after breaking up I remained quite cordial, if not downright friendly, with all of them (the cheater excluded).

I still love my wife despite her feelings towards me, and hope that we can patch this thing back together. We do have two small children. I’m twisted up over the idea of a divorce, but I do know that if my wife and I can’t repair the relationship, a divorce may actually be the better solution for the children.

No, I don’t need any advice, not attaching an email to this. I just hope you found this brief look into my life to be as interesting as it was to live it.

I graduated from Yale College in May and am going to start in August as a 7th grade math teacher at Success Preparatory Academy in Tremé through Teach for America.

My last few days in my soon-to-be-ex-hometown have been spent running around to appointments, with quite a lot of familial awkwardness sprinkled in between. Being home so little over the last four years has made every conversation and interaction with my parents and siblings carry far more importance than necessary, and the disconnects and gaps in understanding make for arguments that, in the moment I’m having them, feel regretful, yet unpreventable.

Accepting parental awkwardness, but not shying away from sincerity I hope comes with age. My 22-year-old brain isn’t capable of just appreciating and accepting. It’s crazy how much effort I put into speculating whether my parents are proud of me, whether they are happy, whether they support what I want to do in life, and whether I am preventing them from having “fulfilled” lives. And what is even crazier is how much effort I put into avoiding talks with my parents about any of these questions—even knowing that this only makes tensions, blow ups, and misunderstandings more common.

This week at home has given me a lot of time to reflect on my past and soon-to-be future, and I’ve found that most of my reflections can be divided into three categories: what I know, what I think, and what I question. These may not be related, but it’s coming from the mind of someone who’s life is scattered and about to explode shrapnel in some unknown direction. Here’s a taste.

I know:

The song “Down the Road” by C2C is the bomb.org.

Razzmatazz is the best flavor you can get from Jamba Juice. Period. Stop reading this and buy the damn smoothie.

I want a life and career that show people they are absolutely worth something—that they are infinitely and impossibly beautiful.

I think:

Pete Holmes’ “You Made It Weird” podcast is the best in the game (sorry Maron). Hilarious and full of great conversations about relationships, comedy, and God.

Free association games are great to play with friends. My favorite is to give your friend two words and have them free associate from the first word to get to the second. For example: free and snake. Free, Freeman, Morgan, Organ, Pipes, Piper, Viper, Snake. Feel what you feel? That’s called joy.

Therefore I think.

I’d rather have a life of volatility, with high highs and low lows. The day before my last college final, I fell in love with a girl I had liked since freshman year. Although it didn’t make sense in terms of timing (and didn’t ultimately work out), we had a two-week relationship that I wouldn’t have traded for anything. Life will not be static. Neither should my decisions.

I question:

The plausibility of pepperoni pizza lunchables. How are they SO GOOD? There’s gotta be a tradeoff—what drugs are they putting in them to cut down on cost and make them taste like magic? I’m skeptical.

Why stoppage time in soccer is so seemingly arbitrary. Shouldn’t they be able to tally up the time when the ball is not in play and have that be stoppage time?

Love—why is it always the people we care most about that we so often hurt the most?

Can you tell which country would fit on a stamp? That's my country. But let's not make things difficult, I come from the land of beer, chocolate and waffles. In that order. Still don't know? Okay then, it is bordered with France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (just a stone's throw away). Yep, you guessed right, it's Belgium!

I'm the proud father of a little angel named Alice. She is 17 months old and makes me smile every morning. So much happiness in such a small body, there must be magic involved. :-) I work as a web developer and a translator (Russian-English-Dutch into French) and I love learning new things.

I'm also a scout. Belgians love scouting actually. And scouting has a purpose: making the world better by contributing to the education of young people. Did you know that a scout makes his best to do a good turn every day? That's our contribution to this world. Small streams make large rivers.

I decided that I should contribute to making this word a little better. Starting with my city. So in 2012, I was a candidate at the local elections for the second time. And I was elected to the Municipal Council, as a councillor for the minority. Did you know that voting is compulsory in Belgium? More than a right, it is your duty as a citizen to cast your vote at every election.

Despite that, one citizen in five − of those old enough to vote − did not vote at the local elections in my city. And out of the remaining four, only two voted for the party of the Mayor. I wish that fifth citizen had voted, this would have changed a lot!

I often hear people saying that voting has no effect. That it's always the same people coming back and back again after every election (and some people use much harsher vocabulary to describe these). But I'm the living proof that one vote can change everything. In my party, one of the candidates − already a municipal councillor − got one less vote for her than I got. I was elected, she was not anymore. Since then, many people told me they cast the vote that made a difference.

I wish you to make a difference and make the world a bit better.

Greetings from Belgium!

In the absence of any wisdom to share with 25,000 of you, I’m instead going to blab about some books.

Books are my passion and my job and a thing that I spend a lot of every day thinking about. I love creating stories and I love to be told them, too – so thank you, email-writing folk of the Listserve, for already sharing so many stories with the rest of us.

I thought I’d tell you about 5 of my favourite books from the different bits of my life so far.

As a baby: ‘The Little Red Car’, by Rosalinda Kightley:I’ve been informed by reliable sources (parents) that, in my earliest years, I was deeply attached to this book. Apparently I handled it, chewed it and flung it around until the cover peeled into two. It’s no longer in print, but I’d love to get hold of a copy to try and work out what on earth was so good about it.

As a child: ‘After the Storm’, by Nick Butterworth:A storm damages an old oak tree in the middle of a park, leaving some animals homeless. So, the park keeper and his animal friends work together to build a cool, new tree house. I’d like to say I loved this story because it championed teamwork and positivity, but I think it was more because it had a giant fold-out tree house poster at the back.

Growing up: The Harry Potter series, by JK Rowling (seven books, not one, thus ruining my nice, neat email title):I was always the same age as Harry when each of these books were published, so I did grow up with them, really. They showed me that the right story could be magic for everyone, even people who weren’t usually into reading. I queued at midnight to get a copy of the seventh book, which came out seven days before my seventeenth birthday. I’ve never really outgrown liking Harry Potter (and, happily, don’t think I ever will).

As a student: ‘Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close’, by Jonathan Safran FoerI bought this book in a charity shop for 50p. It has a strange tone and crazy typography, and I couldn’t stop thinking about it for weeks after I’d read it. It was the first book I ever really wanted to pick apart, so I wrote a dissertation on it as part of my degree. It’s a story that helped me understand disaster and loss, in a more beautiful and complicated way than I thought a story could.

Lately: ‘The Fault in Our Stars’, by John GreenThere’s a lot of hype around this book at the moment, but I’ll never forget how I felt the first time I read it in 2012. It made me laugh and cry, on and off, like my heart was crumbling to bits. It led me to the Nerdfighter and Booktube communities (look them both up!). It brought me back to reading after I’d finished my degree and completely fallen out of love with books – for this I’m forever in its debt.

If you’re still reading, I’d love to hear from you! Tell me about 5 books from your life; tell me about your favourite book and why you like it so much. Say hi on Twitter, too – I’m @editorgabriella.

It’s been lovely writing to you; take care of yourselves, and be happy.

I even calculated using the geometric distribution that my chances of being a winner during my membership so far stand at about a measly 2%.Just after getting the email about winning I went out hiking with a friend in a nature reserve south-east of town.It certainly was one sweltering summer day. I assumed that the silence of the woods, the stillness of a perfectly calm and slightly remote lake, a meal of fried potatoes, onions, fish and a couple of beers would quickly instill some inspiration regarding what is worthy to write some 25,000 people.Unfortunately, this did not quite work as a firestarter for my mind.Perhaps a rainy day in a cabin or shelter would have yielded better results?So, summing it up, the unlikely moment is here for me to write for the Listserve, but it turns out I might have failed to churn out a memorable writeup.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the day in the woods. If I have learnt something from this episode, it is that 48 hours can be way too little to properly handle a great opportunity.Lastly, I wish you all a great week!

What to write...what to write. Keep it simple, but make it good. Ok, let’s try this.

I’ll start with an easy recipe for great taco dip. Equal parts cream cheese and sour cream mixed with a generous amount of taco seasoning to taste. Finish by mixing in shredded cheese and then topping with lettuce and tomato. Good stuff, super fast.

Let’s move on to a story. In the fall of 2009, a group I was involved in during college came into possession of a 3 piece pink tuxedo for a breast cancer fashion show. After that show, we had no idea what to do with this item we had purchased. In January 2010, I came across info for a breast cancer 5k in town, and decided if I trained properly, I could run the 5k in the pink suit. So I bought the suit from the group, trained, and ran in the 5k that year. I’ve run that race in the pink suit for the past 5 years now, and after some chance encounters this past January, I now sit on the Board of Directors for that non-profit’s affiliate in Tucson.

My lesson from that experience was that you never know what’s going to come from any conversation at any time, so always be ready. I’ve had more opportunities fall in my lap from starting a conversation with someone than from actually applying for anything.

I’ve also run a couple half marathons in a business suit and frequent mud runs in one as well. I’ve never really felt like a normal runner. I’m not doing it for health. I’m not doing it for a PR. I don’t have groups I run with. I just love being the spectacle. I know I’m capable of running the race, but I also know I’m capable of doing it while wearing something that will entertain others that are running, so why wouldn’t I?

How about some recommendations and a random thought to finish it?

Board Games: Twilight Imperium 3, Munchkin, Scoville, and Doomworks. I’m in the middle of customizing my copy of TI3 right now, so if you’re a fan, let’s talk.

Plants: Grow a Moringa tree if you’re in the right climate! They’re awesome. No matter what, check out the species. I’m willing to offer a couple of my own seeds, but I just planted my first batch a few weeks ago, so if you can wait 8-10 months, let me know.

Home Repair: Learn it. As an accountant by trade, aside from my board games, physically working on my house is one of my favorite de-stressors. Just did pull-out shelving in the kitchen as a 4th of July project.

I really miss the silence outside from the combination of very cold winter weather and a small town.

Nick, thank you for helping me think about what to write. The Queen would be furious!! **wink wink**

I always love talking to new people. Please drop me a line, anytime.

Everybody is happy, the 200 million Brazilians and the thousands and thousands tourists that came from everywhere in the planet.Our visitors are in love with Brazil. A French journalist wrote that he was shocked for visiting a place where everybody is kind and nice. An American journalist wrote that the feeling of this World Cup should be bottled and exported to Russia and Qatar, hosts of the next ones in 2018 and 2022.Everybody says this is the best World Cup ever, all games are a fantastic party that goes on to the streets of the 12 cities that hosted games. I wanted it would happen again here next year, some say all of them should be here.Brazilians always suffered from an inferiority complex. We used to think that our nation was not good enough for first world visitors: our tarmac with some pot holes, our chaotic traffic in the big cities, high prices, slums in some places. But now we find out that tourists don’t want the same things they have at home.They want new experiences, and Brazil can offer a lot of that. Our culture is very rich, our nature is fantastic – from the beaches to the Amazon -, our people are multiracial and always ready to help a tourist.We have problems, of course, but working hard to solve them. In the last 10 years 37 million people left a situation of poverty and entered the middle class. No other nation achieved that so fast, and it’s a real revolution.After the wonderful World Cup we can say, with no inferiority complex: come visit Brazil, you will love it. You can plan right now coming for the Olymnpic Games in Rio de Janeiro, 2016.Want a taste of Brazil? I will give you a recipe of caipirinha, our national drink that was approved by 10 out of 10 tourists that came for the World Cup. This is a simple one (there are other recipes, more sophisticated), but it works well:Squeeze a lime in a medium glass. Add 2 teaspoons of sugar and 80 cc of cachaça (a Brazilian sugar cane distilled). Stir it well, add lots of ice, stir again and enjoy. You can use more sugar, more cachaça, it’s up to you.Don’t have cachaça? No problem. Use rum, and call it a caipiríssima. Or use vodka, and call it a caipiroska. You will love it anyway.Sorry about my lousy English, but if I used Portuguese nobody would understand me.Wanna reply, wanna know more about Brazil?

He turned Genesis into an interesting story filled with sensuality.

Around 1982, I was in college studying to be an actress. Like any young woman my age, I criticized every aspect of my own appearance. My eyes were too deep-set. My nose was too big. My hair was too curly and wild.

Women with normal eyes told me they spent ages trying to make their eyes look like mine. Women with normal-sized or cute pixie noses told me that they wished their noses were ""more interesting."" Women with straight hair assured me that they would pay good money if they could get their hair to look like mine.

I asked around, and I found that women with straight hair wished desperately for curly hair. They spent a great deal of time trying to force their hair to hold curls. Meanwhile, women with curly hair wished desperately for straight hair! They spent a great deal of time trying to force their hair to be straight and smooth. Women with dark hair wished it were lighter; women with light hair wished it were darker. Women with red hair wished it would be anything else.

It wasn't just women, though. It was a school for the arts, so perhaps not a great sampling, but the men were just as insecure about their appearances. Their beards were too thick or too thin. They were too tall or too short. Their hair, like the women's, was the wrong color, thickness, or texture.

With a few rare exceptions, everyone I asked seemed to hate his or her own natural appearance. When I assured them their noses were on straight or their hair was actually gorgeous, they just smiled at me as if I were a naïve child. They knew that if they hadn't spent an enormous amount of time ""fixing"" themselves, they would not be permitted to walk around in public at all.

I was expected to use make-up to make my eyes ""pop"" and products to tame my hair into something that it was not. I was supposed to ignore the fact that other women were working just as hard to make their eyes and hair appear more like mine.

If I were to conform to these ideals, I would have to spend a great deal of time each morning ""putting on my face"" and ""taming"" my hair. Every night, I would have to spend more time counteracting the damage done by the morning routine. I would have to get special soaps, shampoos, and other products that would clean my skin and repair my hair. I would have to continue to do this for the rest of my life.

I could not understand why it would be a good idea to start every morning of my life trying to change my appearance. I thought it would make a lot more sense to just accept what I look like and hope nobody turned to stone if they saw my bare face and natural hair.

When I get up in the morning, I brush my teeth, wash my face, get dressed, brush my hair, and leave. I can be up and out the door in less than ten minutes from a dead sleep. Nobody has turned to stone. Nobody has sent me home for being ugly or to jail for indecent exposure.

I don't feel sorry for women who wear make-up. I don't want anyone to feel she has to defend her decision to wear make-up. I just want us to accept and believe that make-up is not mandatory.

July 2014,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/07/06/wish-me-luck/,"July 2014, 06",Wish me luck!,"Hi Listserve friends! I was so shocked that I won the Listserve lottery after only following it for about a month. When I got the email I thought it was some kind of mistake at first!

I thought I'd stay with the company I work for now a lot longer, but recently something sparked my ambitious side and I realized that I'm bored, I'm not being challenged, and I need more. Part of what inspired me is that I keep reading and hearing more and more about how women tend to lack the confidence men have, won't apply for jobs unless they feel 100% qualified, don't negotiate their salaries, are severely underrepresented in the tech industry, etc. etc. I realize that all of that applies to me - I do tend to underestimate my abilities and go with the safest bet in my life decisions.

So I went ahead and started looking, and I got responses right off the bat. It felt great! Now, a few weeks into my search, I'm interviewing for a couple of positions that I'm actually really excited about. One is with a very small, very young start-up. I'd be their first customer support employee. Taking that job would be a real gamble, but in the best-case scenario I'd get to be the one who figures out the best and most efficient ways to do things and build a team eventually. That possibility is very exciting.

The other is with a big, well-established company with a fantastic product. This would be a stable job with a great team and a chance to learn a lot of new skills, which is exactly what I want to be doing. This week, I'll have my first in-person interview with them. They gave me a ""homework assignment"" last week that involved doing a few functions with their system and writing a little code, which I didn't know. (I know HTML, CSS, and a little Javascript, but not the stuff they've asked me to do.) In the in-person interview, they'll try to break what I've set up and I'll have to troubleshoot it from there. It's scary because I'm having to teach myself how to do it on the fly, but I just keep telling myself ""I can do this, I can do this"". I keep telling myself that they can teach me the languages they need me know - what they really need is someone smart and motivated to learn, who knows how to communicate. And that's who I am!

So, what I want to say to you all is this: don't be afraid to look for a new challenge if you don't feel like you're reaching your full potential. You have so much to contribute to our world, and you're doing yourself and the rest of us a disservice if you're not making that full contribution. Asking more of yourself and facing the possibility of failure is scary, but it always pays off. Even if you do fail, you learn from it and move on to your next challenge. Just do it!

I hope you all are happy and healthy, and I want you to know I’m cheering you on from my home in the East Bay. I believe in you and I hope you believe in me too! And if you ever need some extra encouragement, look no further than your friend and mine, Andrew WK.

July 2014,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/07/05/pride-pride/,"July 2014, 05",Pride/pride,"I dreamt last night that I was in the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan. Starting on street level, I entered its doors and made my way up toward the top, but it contained many more levels than in real life. On my way up I encountered two businessmen with their arms around one another, faces close but not touching, looking out a big glass window. Rahm Emanuel, democratic mayor of Chicago, passed them by and stepped onto the escalator. We made eye contact and I stepped on after him. My Brooklyn friend Emma called me on the phone and I gazed out the glass windows onto the skyline of Manhattan's tall architecture. People all around me. No one paying attention to anyone else in particular.

Many cities have Pride celebrations in summer. Minneapolis, New York, San Francisco. All havens for LGBT equality. At least in comparison to Mississippi. I've lived here for just over a month now. We have gay people, I mean there are gay people everywhere. But I haven't seen any pride here. I also haven't seen Pride here. So on Saturday I drove with a couple co-workers/friends to Baton Rouge, a 2.5 hour drive from Jackson. There we attended Baton Rouge Pride. It took place in a large hotel atrium. We parked several blocks away and, trying to locate it, looked for any sign of pride/Pride - rainbow flags, evidently gay people, loud music. None of that. We entered the atrium and still we were unsure if we were in the right place. Only when we walked deeper into the atrium did we hear the music and see the people. And there was pride, there really was. Same-sex couples holding hands, people in drag, vendor tables selling pride gear.

The South, the last frontier for LGBT equality in the US. Pride is here. But it's hidden, deep into a hotel atrium, not on the streets. I wouldn't say it's oppressive. Not anymore, at least. Living here I can feel the chokehold on gays, not to mention blacks and Jews and other historically marginalized groups, loosening as we progress further into the 21st century. But it is no one's M.O. the full on embrace of equality, tolerance, progess, whatever term that can be used to mean everyone living happily and without fear of persecution. New York City. Minneapolis. San Francisco. Are these the places, the northern cities, where one can be proud? Is there more? Can the South offer more?

I'm in the South for two years. That's the job contract, at least. As of now I'd say afterward I'll jet back up to one of the northern cities, familiar as they may be, just so I can breathe, and walk. And march. Oh how I want to WALK!

Please write to me. Southerners, Northerners, anyone else with some perspective from some other place. I just picked up Andre Aciman's collection of essays Alibis: Essays on Elsewhere. Speaks to these themes. (Side note, the first story is about the power of smell, it's called ""Lavender."" I read this essay on the same day, within hours, of buying a cologne sampler pack at Sephora. Such a coincidence. As of now I'll trade in my sampler certificate for a full bottle of Bulgari Extreme.)

I'd like to begin this letter to you all with a Tibetan prayer for lovingness and kindness.

""May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be happy.May all beings be safe. May all beings awaken to the light of their true nature.May all beings be free.""

I was once told, that I'm the guy who talks a lot about himself and the shit I do, but the reality is not everyone wants to listen to you! As much as I'd love to tell you the story of my life till now, I choose not to. Everyone has a story that is unique and beautiful.

A year back I was broken. Today I'm fixed. (literally, since I ride fixies)

My advice to my fellow Listservians, do what you want to do, live your life to the fullest and, if you believe in something (good, cherish-able and peaceful), give it your heart and soul till you achieve it, no compromises. Anything is possible, just believe in yourself.

You can always write in to me at , and, I'd love to share my 2 cents on the things I love the most, cycling, food, fitness and travel.

My name is Ben and I am a 20 year old American college student hailing from the bustling metropolis that is North Bend, Washington. I actually attend university in Washington, D.C. where I am double majoring in International Affairs and German.            Now that you at least know a few things about me, I’d like for you to go back to the subject line and read it over again. It is my opinion that to know a person, and I mean really understand what makes them tick, you must know what they are most afraid of. In the above paragraph I told you some basic information about myself, but all of that doesn’t really show who I am or what I am like.

I am terrified of being forgotten.

How about now? Know me a little better? I hope so. Let me give you a little insight into the depths of my fear.My fear motivates everything that I do.It’s why I moved 3,000 miles away to continue my education. Staying in my hometown with the same 5,000 people doesn’t lend itself to the kind of life changing feats as does moving to a city with a population of over 120 times that. I wanted a chance to meet people I would never have the chance to meet if I had stayed in the region my entire life. I wanted to embrace the kind of change in myself that I hoped to encourage in others. I wanted future classes from my high school to look at former graduates and say “If Ben could do it, why can’t I?”My fear is why I volunteer in my community and in others wherever I can. It’s why I spent a week in New Orleans building a house with Habitat for Humanity in the lower 9th ward for a former carney (and human blockhead!!) who lost his home during Hurricane Katrina. It’s why I’m going back again this coming winter.It’s why I worry so much about what people think of me. Those countless people you meet in life aren’t going to remember someone who is boring, or a jerk. Who would want to remember that person? Who would want to remember some short kid who looks 5 years younger than he actually is? Even now writing an email to 25,000 strangers I wonder what I sound like. Am I coming off as arrogant or whiny? Or just insecure?I guess I want to believe that it is ok to be afraid.I could go on forever, but I only have so many words. Instead I’ll leave you with a little bit of advice (if you want it, I mean, what could some 20 year old tell you?)-Have a good joke you can tell-Guys, learn to cook. Fried Oreos are the key to a girl’s heart-Exercise is good for the mind and body-have firm beliefs (ex: Motion Movement by Blue Scholars is the greatest song ever)-Love easily and love hard. I have no good way to phrase this, but falling in love with someone is the greatest thing in this world. To be completely vulnerable to them is terrifying and liberating and changes you both. Even if it gets you hurt, there is nothing like remembering an awkward first kiss after an aquarium date. Love is a beautiful thing,­ never give it up.

I’d love to hear back from y’all!

Her hot pink underwear is visibly exposed, and I can't tell if this is a fashion choice or if I should worry about her. She looks like she belongs at Burning Man, with her dreads and rainbow socks. She dials person after person to tell them how dizzy she feels.

She is lying down on a bench. ""It's the adrenaline,"" she says. She just got a place, and a steady job. She is dizzy from the relief. She finishes her calls and wanders after her daughter. I decide the undone pants are a conscious choice, or she would feel them about to slide down. Besides, I don't know how I would broach the topic.

And pants or no pants, both of us are here to do our jobs. Beyond the most egregious acts, our references won't be checked. We have decades to go before our shifts end, whether dizzy, sick, or unstable. Our kids are on the slide, begging for our attention. We watch them, waving and calling out together.

But what does being respectful mean? I think there’s an idea that to be respectful means to always be nice to others—but I find that idea misguided.

It’s important to assume a default attitude of niceness. Generally speaking, the world is a better place if you be nice to others. But sometimes a person is no longer worthy of your respect. Oftentimes, this happens because this person has done something or said something which has hurt someone you respect even more. At times like these, dropping the ""be nice to others"" strategy is perfectly acceptable—you should stand up for that person who still holds your respect, in the face of the one who has lost it.

In short: Be nice to other people as you come across them, but be loyal to those who have earned your respect.

***

The high school system I’m going through requires a certain number of volunteer hours to be completed before graduation. The most common way to earn these hours is through volunteering at summer camps; I did this, working with disabled campers in a one-on-one setting, to help them make the most out of their experience.

I don’t volunteer with camps anymore, though. Now I volunteer my time towards writing code, specifically open-source code which is freely shared with the world. The project I dedicate most of my time to is WordPress and its related efforts, pitching in time to help build a platform which brings the power of self-publishing to so many people for free.

I started out with this code volunteering by fixing typos and grammatical errors and unclear instructions whenever I came across them. It was a great outlet to practice these skills, and all the while I was helping any future users of that code understand it better.

You can volunteer with open source projects too, whether you’re a person who can code or not. Look up ""Contributing to WordPress"" to learn how you can help by translating, documenting, or all sorts of other activities. And if you know how to code, pitch in that way! Don’t let the size of the project daunt you—we try to be a friendly bunch! If you need some more direction to get started, send me an email and I’d be glad to help you.

People often lose track of the value of volunteering once they enter the ""real world"". But the sense of accomplishment and pride it gives you is second-to-none.

***

My profession is as a designer, which means I spend a lot of time indoors hunched over a computer or sketchbook. But the activity I enjoy most in the world is walking.

Throughout my day, I’ll take many walking breaks. Sometimes 20 minutes, sometimes an hour, sometimes far more, all dedicated to the leisurely activity of walking. While I walk, I don’t listen to music. Actually, I usually leave my phone at home.

Walking is a way to remind me that we’re too busy trying to be connected to a world beyond our local one, and it’s a way to connect me with what’s going on around me. Walking the same (or similar) routes each day lets you see the change over time in a space and get to know everyone around.

Go out on walks and talk with the people you encounter. It’s one of the most rewarding things I do.

Well, that’s it folks. Please get in touch! I’d love to get to know you better.

""[1] There isn't a name that describes the magnificent, terrific creature that is my Grannie. She raised three kids almost entirely by herself, and then raised my Gramps' children, and a couple decades later her children's children. To support herself and her people she welded, worked for RCA, sold real estate, owned a nail salon, a liquor store and a laundromat. In the meantime, she taught me all the skills I would need to survive in prison: to spend days reading, play poker and be happy with my own company. She hasn't had a bad hair day since I was born, and has broken a single nail in two decades. The love she has for her family is only equaled by the murderous rage she has waiting for anyone that tries to hurt them; it is at both times the scariest and most enabling trait I have inherited from her.

[2] Judy is a native Texan who moved to DC to work for an organization protesting the Vietnam War. She became a lawyer and bought and flipped houses that are worth hundreds of thousands of dollars now in her spare time. She ate organic and local back when it was weird and fringe. She married my cousin and mentor, who couldn't have been less like her, and theirs is the love story that could immunize against romantic cynicism on a global scale. When she isn't telling people what she thinks she's simplifying my problems with chilling ease or reminding me that pragmatism isn't very useful if it doesn't make you happy.

[3] It's not entirely clear what Leah is going to be yet (philanthropist, mother and advisor will likely be among her illustrious titles). What is evident however is that she has the makings of being one of the baddest b*tches who ever graced this here planet. She serves as a baby whisperer for crying infants the world over. She knows everything about the Catholic faith, and almost everything about almost everything else. She taught me the real meaning of kindness, and let me join her family without thought. Nobody has ever bullied her into doing something she didn't want to do, and has never thought twice about putting the straying in their place, especially me. If you don't believe in a universal moral code, it's because you aren't familiar with hers yet. On behalf of the mad LC, you're welcome world.""

To all of the women and men in my life who lifted me up so that I could achieve my dreams, who emboldened me to be always and unapologetically myself, everything I do is so that I can honor your love.

I’m 20 years old and currently a third year student at the University of Waterloo.  I absolutely love my University because of the great opportunities it leads me to. By the time I graduate in 2016, I’ll have approximately a year and half of working experience all thanks to the co-op program. Although my university years have played a key role in shaping my identity, and I could go on about that for a while, I want to share something with you that truly makes me who I am today.

Today, I want to share a little story about two special heroes in my life: my mom and dad. About 12 years ago, my parents decided to move to Canada from Kuwait for the sole purpose of their kids’ education. Coming to Canada, at the age of eight, I couldn’t ever comprehend what this would mean for our family. My dad decided to stay back for a while as he had been doing really well in his career back in Kuwait. My mom took care of us, helped us with our homework and ran the household here. Their time apart for 10 years meant that they made their children’s education and success their absolute priority in life. It wasn’t just the big sacrifices. I remember waking my dad up at 2:00 am his time, in Kuwait, to go on MSN and help me with a physics problem I had been struggling with. My parents’ intense love and dedication for us gives me the strength to push my limits and fears aside to continuously strive for more. The education, morals, and values they have instilled in me have made me who I am today – a leader and a fighter. And I can’t thank them enough, except to acknowledge and honour everything that they have done and continue to do for me.

Currently, I’m taking a course on Coursera called “Programming for Everyone”. I have no clue why, but educational systems fascinate me…and what interests me more are the differences between them, across cultures. This course is teaching me basic Python programming skills through data analysis. It’s amazing how technology is changing our world, especially classrooms and teaching students. It’s why I wanted to learn coding. One of the reasons why I enjoy online education is because I am allowed to move at my own pace. It satisfies my curiosity and there’s always more to learn – it never stops and I love it!

If you have any recommendations on books, music, advice or just want to connect, I would love to hear from you!

June 2014,27,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/06/27/there-and-back-again/,"June 2014, 27",There and Back Again,"I knew something was wrong last summer when I woke up at 3 am, and she was staring out of the window. She told me that a work buddy was picking her up. Her cadence was clipped and she couldn't explain why she needed to leave. I looked at her phone when she went to the bathroom to discover that said friend was out of town. Alexis was hallucinating.

The next day she didn't meet me like she said she would. She called me 4 hours later and struggled to figure out where she was and how to get home. Once we got to the ER, she was admitted and given a diagnosis. My wife had bipolar disorder.

When we talk the months following her hospitalization, I realize we had completely different experiences. What she went through at that time sounds hellish, and I'm not sure I'd be able to endure it. However, there's a unique and surreal kind of horror endured by a person trying to help some one through a manic episode. That's what I'm here to talk about.

Alexis was released from the hospital before her mania had fully subsided because of insurance reasons. Over the next month, she would leave the house at noon and return in the early morning, without telling me where she was going. After learning that she wasn't seeing or talking to friends and family, it became clear she was wandering the streets of New York by herself.

She accused me of robbing her of her independence and asked me for a divorce. I thought this was strange since we had always valued our independence. In fact, we decided to go to colleges in different towns (we're high school sweethearts) to preserve it. The irony is, this was a time when she was least able to exercise that independence. I did things that, although I realize were in Alexis' best interest, I still feel guilty about. I slipped the medicine she refused to take in her food and coffee. I turned GPS tracking on her phone and checked it constantly. I stole and hid her credit cards. After a month, she went to go stay with her mother in Florida. She began to take her meds and decided she wanted to return to New York – and me.

Slowly but surely, Alexis began to pick up the pieces left in the wake of her manic episode. She's thriving and feeling better every day, and we're both learning how to deal and mange her condition. Sometimes it's just as if nothing happened; other times it feels like the specter of bipolar disorder casts a pall over every conversation and decision. I think about the violations of trust I committed to try to help her and worry if I might need to do that again. I worry that I may not know her passwords if that day comes. I worry about telling her, “Smoochers, I would never keep tabs on you, but I'd really like you to tell me when you update your Gmail, in case I have to spy on you again.”

I may have not known what I was in for when we got married, but I don't regret a thing. While these trials may have complicated our relationship, they've also deepened it. I'm floored by with the strength, bravery and grace that she has handled this with. If you or a loved one are going struggling with bipolar disorder, I'm happy to share the little wisdom I have.

She towered in front of the canvas, and it was hard to tell where Modigliani's brushstrokes stopped and where she began. Liquid leather leggings painted her skin in the same black as the 5:15 November twilight absorbing into the Victorian buildings across 54th street.  She had the hair of a crow, casually wrapped around a sock like a cinnamon roll, framing the v of her nose and the pine of her eyes.

He had been here before; the same excruciating scene played out more frequently than he cared to admit. Him, standing there like a damn fool, feeling his feet form an ionic bond with the hardwood floor while he convinced himself she was no good.  Sure, she could be different. Yes, maybe he had matured. Of course, true love is searching too, waiting for him to step into the light.  One. Two. Three. Four. Five.

The faint Daisy smells of Jasmine petals and musk sucker-punched him allowing only a second more of consciousness to notice her small scarlet mouth and Calla skin as he veered by.  He was hoping she would look his way. Eye contact. A smirk. A nod. An affirmation. An opportunity. He made his first failed pass.

“It doesn’t matter anyways,” he told himself in the neighbouring round room. He’d read this chapter. What starts as lustful enthusiasm quickly turns to misplaced words, overanalyzed reactions, distance, and dying.  He shifted the 8 ⅛ hat on his head in diffidence questioning the morning’s wardrobe decisions in his weakly lit studio. “Stupid hat.” He muttered. He told himself he was happy she didn’t see him.  He was comfortable with his current complacency and moped passed the greens and pinks of Matisse without looking up.

Though she did notice him. She first admired his hat, then his boots, and appreciated the comfort displayed in his self-expression.  A brief fantasy made its way across her mind: the two of them sampling the delights of Spices and Tease before searching for antique treasures at Junk while beating the storm back to her place only to sit by Geranium candles and watch “Populaire.” She imagined a honeymoon in Mumbai.  She quickly corrected herself. “Shutup.” she reminded.  “I’m better alone.  He wouldn’t understand me: just like the last one.”  She stopped and secretly wished to have had the same loss of inhibitions as the five nude woman dancing in front of her on the basic greens and blues so that she could start a conversation. “Show me the Klimt that makes your stomach hurt.” She imagined herself rhapsodizing to him.

At the lilies, he regrouped “No. I have many failures of which I am the most proud. Today is a day of growth.” He paced in a crazy-eight and retook his course. He knew better than to backward cast his eye on prospects drear. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten.

She made her way into a windowed corner and stared at the steel roof next door.  She justified her cowardice “Probably has a girlfriend.” The deepest sigh.

Upon his return, the men admiring the Madame on the wall were not what he was hoping to find.  He searched the galleries and raced for the steps. He saw the red soles of her Louboutin’s disappear under the second floor’s balcony. “Wait!” he grunted, three floors too high for her to hear. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen.

Step. Step. Sixteen. Step. “excuse me.” Step. Step. Seventeen. Step. “Pardon.”

Eighteen. Nineteen.

She listlessly exited the museum.

He puddle-jumped through the lobby.

She looked back. Nothing. “Another cab ride alone.”

First of all, what a day! It’s the first time in my life I actually won something! Feels great.

Secondly; a brief introduction. My name is Raoul, 26 y/o. Just finished doing the dishes.Living in Holland. Earning (some) money as a graphic designer.Like a lot of people on earth I enjoy music, art, tasty food & beer, our sun and spending time with my friends/loved ones.

What I really love is combining everything together by visiting (electronic) music festivals.Nothing beats dancing in the sun together with my friends & strangers. You should definitely visit one of the many outdoor festivals in the Netherlands during summer, the vibe is always great. Try visiting a small festival: better atmosphere, better music, smiles everywhere, less commercial crap. I will name some DJ’s, bands & other stuff I like below. It’s a bit of everything but worth checking out.

Moving on to probably my biggest passion, graphic design. I love making prints, shapes, layouts, typography, drawing letters, silly characters. Although it’s hard for me making a living with graphic design at the moment I enjoy every second making stuff. It’s satisfying solving someone’s design problem, making information easily digestible and making people smile just by using shapes and letters.

As a rookie designer, seeing the excellent work of other designers is sometimes very intimidating. Still I keep on working knowing at some point in life I will end up where I need to be. I am curious if any of you readers are in a similar situation. Or even better, have been there and in the end got exactly where they needed to be. Lemme know & show your work.

Like everyone else I can’t help to end with some kind of advice. All smart things have been said by other Listserve winners so I think it’s time for some dumb advice. Be weird! Do dumb shit but know when to stop. Temporally alter your perception; can be done in numerous ways. Put on your grandma’s glasses and take a walk. Visit a rave! ☺! ☮! Walk instead of taking the bus/car. Take a detour. Write down every wacky idea you have, at night, under the shower, later it can turn out to be a golden idea. Doing dumb things may seem dumb at first but can provide a totally new way of looking at things. Try it sometime.

Ps.—I have got one favor to ask from you fellow listservers living in or visiting Berlin (Kreuzberg)Please keep your eyes peeled for a girl that fits the following description: Name begins with E, is Dutch, 23 y/o, long legged, brown eyed, dark/brown haired, *very* messy eyebrows, long eyelashes, clumsy, big smile, crazy about food / food-design, birthmark on her left cheek - near her nose, doing an internship in Berlin (food-oriented), uses subway line U7 a lot.

Please say Hi for me. Tell her I love her and that I can’t wait to hold her again. I really miss her but due to circumstances I can’t tell her myself at the moment. Plus it would be awesome if some actually managed to find and tell her. Interesting way of crowdsourcing.

June 2014,23,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/06/23/color-systems-in-brief/,"June 2014, 23","Color systems, in brief","Ever wonder why that blue on your monitor prints darker on your printer?Here’s the basic why ….

The two typical color systems are RGB and CMYK (you’ve heard these used a lot).

RGB (red, green, and blue) is the type of color system used for light; it is an ADDITIVE system, so when you add them all together, you get WHITE.

CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) is the type of color system used for basic printing; it is a SUBTRACTIVE color system, so the absence of color gives you WHITE (or paper, in this case). The use of high percentages of CMYK is called “rich black” (its a deeper black than just using 100% K. And yes, black is “K” -- not to be confused with blue, which is “B”).

The reason your print doesn’t look like your screen is because you can’t produce all the same colors from CMYK that you can from RGB. In the spectrum of color you can see, RGB gives you the most options, then the Pantone system (we’ll discuss this in a minute), and then the most limiting, CMYK. You’ll notice blues and greens print the worst … you’re hitting the limits of CMYK.  (Google “color gamut” and you can see what I’m talking about.)

As I mentioned, there is also the Pantone Matching System (or PMS for short.) All designers will have what will look to you like a paint sample book on their desk; it’s actually a Pantone swatch book. Pantone colors are proprietary and widely used to choose a “spot color.” They are pre-mixed colors that will consistently be *that* color, 187C is always a dark red.

A designer will often use this book to pick colors for logos because the color translated on screen or from a CMYK printer won’t match the actual PMS sample. Also, think about your printer and my printer. The type of ink, or paper -- it will change how the color looks. Your monitor might not be color corrected like mine, and a website will look different from a monitor to a TV set (both use RBG color). Pantone, being a premixed color, will ensure consistency throughout all printed materials. “Barbie Pink” and “Coke Red” are pre-mixed Pantone colors (but their formula is a secret!). There are some generic named colors like “Rubine Red” or “Reflex Blue,” but that’s a holdover from some olden-day printing.

I hope my little lesson on color helped you in some small way today!

Now, a question. Some friends and I are trying to get an online magazine-ish-blog started. We ran one for the past few years, but now is the time to really do it for REAL, promote it and maybe even bring in some extra income with advertising. Our content includes personal essays related to current events. It’s about the story behind the story. We aren't looking for hard hitting journalists. We're looking for anyone who wants to share how their world is impacted by the world around them. If you would like to contribute shoot me an email (it’s a few months away from launching, but we can provide story topics, or take submissions). Also, if you have any experience or can provide guidance for our little startup, I would love to talk!

Finally, to a few fellow listserve readers: Lyndsy, I wish you and Rodrigo the best -- and I am so excited for you to start the next chapter in your life. Husband, I love you and I don’t know what I would do without you. Thank you for sharing this life with me.

June 2014,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/06/22/languages-a-little-ambiguity/,"June 2014, 22",Languages & a little ambiguity,"After having read every Listserve email for almost two years, I thought that my turn would come sometime later in life - perhaps when I’m more settled? That’s what everyone else made me believe at least. But damn, while I’m more than happy with almost everything in life, my professional life is a big question mark! I don’t really have any advice or anything for you all so I guess I’ll just narrate a little bit of me.

I’m a 22 year old girl born and raised in New Delhi (it’s almost 46°C these days, damn summers!) - capital city of India and I’m one of those people who always knew what they wanted to do in life. So my University major was Japanese - and even though I was just fascinated by things like origami back in high school that led me to this, Japanese made me fall in love with languages. So I tried learning French and gave up mid way only to realise that my fascination was more towards languages that don’t use the Roman script. Next I took up Korean and man, don’t I love it! I want to learn Arabic next but then Esperanto looks interesting as well (any Esperanto speakers here? Would love to hear from you!). Being a polyglot is an amazing thing. I speak 4 languages right now - my mother tongue Hindi, apart from English, Japanese and Korean, and I’m still not satisfied with just these. However, it’s just a little sick how people look at languages in India. It’s a country still obsessed with orthodox careers like engineering, medical sciences, law etc. and people end up thinking that you didn’t get anywhere else to end up with a language as your major. What they don’t know is just because of this stereotype, the field remains untapped to a great extent and you can do so much more than the traditional careers if you’re good at it.

So why did I say that my professional life is a big question mark? Well, because I don't know where will I be a few months down the line and I hate this ambiguity. While I have some real amazing job offers waiting for me here, I am waiting for a small little email from the MEXT of Japan that gives me my scholarship result. I got admitted to Waseda University in Tokyo for a masters in International Relations but I still don’t know if I’ll go or not due to this scholarship result. I’ll probably have the result with me by the time this email is sent out on the Listserve though! And yes, it’s not just languages that I love. I also enjoy politics, history, cycling, running, cooking, origami and music.

Apart from this little ambiguity, life is so good I wouldn’t want to trade it for anything. I’m doing what I love to do, have an amazing family and I’m in love with the most amazing guy. I’ve been in love before and I’ve dated before, but I guess you only feel the right kind of love once in life. Of all things, it happened when I wasn’t even expecting it. How good could life be?

Drop in a little email for just about anything or if you would like to exchange language practice emails. I’ve been a silent member of the Listserve all these years but I promise I’ll reply!

PS: A big shout out to Karthik for introducing me to the Listserve and also to everyone else I asked to join the same :)

May the force be with you!

He deserves special recognition for his efforts to help children in some of the toughest places on earth.

June 2014,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/06/19/knifed-in-senegal/,"June 2014, 19",Knifed in Senegal,"I’d spent the early part of the afternoon at an internet cafe across the cul-de-sac from my hotel, mostly reading news and sending a couple of emails in the name of dodging the midday heat. Leaving in the late afternoon, a roaming street vendor approached me about 50m from La Brazzerade, the hotel I was staying at while in Dakar, Senegal. The street was still busy; plenty of the stalls were still selling things to tourists, and there was lots of human traffic about. This roaming vendor had a basket of things taking up both of his hands, like a washing basket would. He starts yapping away at me rapidly in French. When I finally got a moment, I said I couldn't understand him.

He switched to broken, searching English.

On top of this basket was a foam board with holes punched through it. In the holes pairs of sunglasses sat propped up. Some were a little scratched, most just looked like knock offs. ""Want sunglasses?""

I pointed to my forehead where a pair of sunnies were perched. In case he missed the gesture, I deadpanned, ""I've already got some"".

He smiled, ""OK OK!"" and in putting the board on the ground greater revealed the contents of his basket. A length of rope was tied in a circle and on it watches were kept; all showing different times, many scratched to shit and looking altogether pretty second-hand. ""Want watch?""

For the second time, I fended off the would-be salesman; I gestured to my own watch, an old Seiko, significantly less scratched and showing a time I believed. With an apologetic smile, I mentioned “I already have one.”

He smiled toothily, even more broadly than before. ""OK OK!"" Delicately, he put the watches atop the sunglasses on the ground, getting to a collection of small cardboard boxes in his basket. Opening one, he pulled out a bottle of fragrance, half full. ""Want perfumes?""

Now, it'd be a cold day in hell that I'd catch myself carrying perfume but I got away with, ""no, no woman, no girlfriend, no wife"".

The toothy grin persisted, accompanied with the now customary ""OK OK!"" and he began placing those items on the ground beside the rest of his booty. By now, his basket was mostly empty. He pulled out its last item which was obscured by a few perfume boxes.

It’s a knife.

Oh fuck.

I took half a step back. It was broad daylight and totally in public. There were dozens of people around, many quite close. I'd so far been reasonably lighthearted with respect to this nonexistent transaction but it had drained from me now, leaving uncertainty and a very real amount of fear. He stepped forward, knife extended, still smiling.

Smiling, as this was probably how he came to obtain these things he was now ""selling"" and he'd just ostensibly hit jackpot for future sales. I was rooted to the spot. Through the toothy grin came, ""want knife?""

I could hardly believe it. Right hand diving into my pocket, I retrieved and unfolded in one motion a knife that Russ, my housemate, had given me last year.

""Nah mate, I've got a knife.""

He kept smiling, gathered his things and wandered off, wishing me a good day. I went and found beer to heavily self medicate with.

June 2014,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/06/18/,"June 2014, 18",:),"Outlandish theories of mine that I don’t necessarily believe:

- Maybe when we sleep, our changed brain wave patterns allow us to sense some of the other timelines in the multiverse, which inform our dreams.

- Perhaps a strong emotional event causes brain waves to imprint onto wood at a quantum level like a hard drive writes to magnetic material. People who are sensitive to it could get a feeling of what happened. So ghosts are like, not interactive.

- Regarding the Fermi Paradox: What if our concept of space-time is way off—just an illusion in the state of matter we call consciousness.So we’re out there, somewhere, waiting for us to contact us... Nah.________________________________

For posterity:

In 1994, at the age of 17, I left my home in New York and went on a backpacking trip across Europe with my best friend. We had no debit cards, no smart phones with Google Maps—no cell phones at all. We had travelers checks you could only cash during regular business hours, and before the Euro that meant loosing money exchanging everywhere we went with little idea of the exchange rate—and hardly a way to check.

The web was in its infancy, and there weren't really any “cyber cafes” to send an email to the one or two friends that actually had email addresses. I think I spoke to my parents once over the course of a month. Finding useful information online was impossible; our nearly sole source of information was a “Let’s Go Europe” guide book.

Now, I can hardly go somewhere 5 blocks away in my own neighborhood without checking Google Maps. How did we manage? How did we get around? Paper maps?! We had to ask strangers for directions, which in turn helped us meet new people and find places that weren’t in the guide book. People would leave messages for each other on bulletin boards in youth hostels like “MM, We’ll be in Paris at the Aloha Hostel in 2 weeks”.  Things were way more inconvenient, but demanded mental strength, emotional independence, and being more social in real life. Honestly, I can hardly believe I did it.

In retrospect, I can really grasp how much my life has changed as a result of technology. I remember hearing my parents talk about when they got their first TVs and thinking how different times were for them growing up. I think the difference between their generation and mine is drastically less than my generation and the next. I’ve become so dependent on computers and the internet that I'd like to try to take a one week sabbatical from all computer technology once a year and go camping. It takes a couple days to “detox” and stop reaching for my phone every 30 seconds, but when I do, and get over Fear Of Missing Out, it is a great feeling of freedom. I love technology—I’m a coder and electronic musician—but it is really important to remember that we can live without it.________________________________

June 2014,17,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/06/17/thanks-to-my-families/,"June 2014, 17",thanks to my families,"Hey friends. I'm Peter, a 21 y/o college student studying biology and psychology with (i think) far too much job experience lifeguarding for someone my age. 

I got this email after a long-as-hell finals week closing out a longer-as-hell school year (just finished my third year of college) and was about to head home for a weekend with my family. I had two siblings' graduation party to attend (brilliant grads of the 8th and 12th grades), father's day festivities to partake in, and a brother from out of state in town to visit with. What with all the fun and familial silliness (familliness?) I had going on I very nearly didn't find the time to send all of you my little note. 

So I guess with the caveat that I have not lived that long/accrued much ""wisdom"" or whatever, I'll just share my feelings after this family weekend as well as a bit of advice. I'm super thankful for all the families I've belonged to, including but not limited to my family-family, my dorm-mates and other friends at school, my lovely family that hosted me for 4 months in Denmark, my teammates over the years, and folks I go to church with. I'm also looking forward to the families I may one day belong to.

Particularly in light of a day like father's day, remember to show love and thanks however suits you best to all the families that you're a part of, be they ones you were born into or those you made yourself or found later on. Gratitude looks good on everybody, and in a world with so few universally-flattering colors, it's a pretty stylin' idea to incorporate it into your wardrobe.

On the heels of that half-baked advice, I would advise you to also

-watch The Lego Movie, idgaf how old you are it's the best thing ever-read ""Everybody's Free to Wear Sunscreen""-listen to One Direction (or at least don't be an elitist turd and hate on those who do [such as yours truly])-be bold in asking people if you can pet their dogs

Oh how I wish that wasn’t such a cliché. There are so many things I wanted to share with you, but this topic is really a message to myself.

Being honest with others is important, but being honest with yourself has to come first and is probably harder. Admitting when I’m wrong, my bad habits like procrastination, or that I’ve been making excuses is uncomfortable, but it’s ok to experience discomfort. Confronting my true feelings on others, how I want to spend my time, or what my big dreams are without disclaimers, is more than a worthy goal. It’s key to living “true to myself”.

Probably the hardest thing I’ve had to admit to myself that I grew up with an alcoholic. Although I dealt with the repercussions of that every day, it was a long, slow process to accept as truth. It’s still hard to talk about, but now that I can, it frees me to ask myself how I really feel about it and address the consequences.

One consequence was that I became a people-pleaser, worrying more about what others wanted than what I needed. It took me a long time to realize you don’t have to try to please everyone. Steps to independence have made it easier to feel, voice, and assert my needs. After high school, I practiced ‘being rude’ as a way of rebelling against people-pleasing. In college I began to spend my breaks the way I wanted to. As I’ve become an independent adult, I’ve realized all the choices I’m lucky to have: where I live, what I do for a living, who to include in my self made family. Lately I’ve been asking everyone around me for their opinions on decisions I need to make, from trivial to important, but the key to making decisions lies in knowing myself better.

I’m thinking a lot about living authentically because of my biological father. I only first met him recently. He sent child support growing up, but nothing else as far as I knew. I’m easy to find and contact on the web, but I never heard a peep from him until I sent him a random facebook message – just short update on my life, as I thought he was not interested. I was shocked to receive a long, gushing reply telling me how much he had longed to communicate with me all those years. Ever since, I have been wondering what really stopped him when it was so easy before, and when all it took was one small prompt to open the floodgates from him of stories and hopes. He has his excuses but he knows they’re just that. Learning more about him and the ghostly presence I’ve apparently had in his life, I’ve imagined how different things could have been and still could be if he could be honest with himself, and then with people in his life, about me and probably many other things too.

I’d like to come back to this email in a year and see if I followed my own advice. How do you keep yourself honest? Please write back! A couple other things we can chat about:

What’s your favorite band to see live? I’m a show fiend.

Brazilian percussion. Check out The Handphibians!

German Wheel. Average people can learn awesome new skills, at places like Madison Circus Space.

June 2014,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/06/13/food-for-thought/,"June 2014, 13",Food for Thought,"Greetings to everyone on the listserve. I'm Matthias, a 23 year old student, and amongst other things, I study computer science, philosophy and psychology. I'm not writing some long detailed story, I just want to give good ""food for thought"" to everyone of you.

1) Developing skills and competence that suit your character, and utilizing them is a crucial life task. Don't do something you need to do - become really good at something you want to do instead. I know it's an old saying, but motivation really is the key.

2) ""Someone who walks slow, still goes faster than somebody standing still"". Actually starting something, even if it's slow, is better than not starting it at all. Also, progress requires goals, and growth - otherwise you might stop walking.

3) Infinity isn't just ""large"" - it's not a static entity, like a huge number. It's just used to describe the lack of any boundaries. Also see ""Infinite monkey theorem"", Graham's number.

4) Causality chain: Everything that happens is a result of a long chain of other events. If one event in this chain would've been different, the whole outcome might have been completely different as well. Every fraction of a second counts. Think about a specific occurence, and track back all the little things that lead to it. You can go backwards in chain links forever, and if a coincidence didn't happen at the correct second, everything could've been different. It might sound a bit extreme, but after all it seems that our entire existence is based on a huge chain of accurate events. See also: Chaos theory, butterfly effect, determinism.

5) In regards to 4), coincidence really is amazing and one of the most powerful things. Some might believe in destiny or fate, but after all, the universe is a complex and dynamic system, where everything affects each other. Try out as many things as you can, have a plan and be dedicated, but also allow yourself to ""experience coincidence"", so many options might come towards you.

6)  In the end, only memories stay, and you're only experiencing the presence. So the underlying reasoning behind all our actions might be experiencing as many good moments as possible.

7) The reason we procrastinate is because we value the presence much more than the uncertain future. Enjoyment (=reward) right now > possible benefits in the future.

8) ""A man convinced against his will, is of the same opinion still"". If you want someone to do or believe something, he must want it.

9) Most people are defensive and unwilling to admit mistakes, thus, criticizing is often pointless. However, agreeing with someone in a debate often does wonders, and might lead to the other person suddenly questioning himself.

10) There is no perfect ethical system. Almost always, you could interpret an action as right or wrong (e.g. murder could cause more good than bad, and thus might be justified in one system, but of course measuring the amount of ""good"" or ""bad"" is subject to interpretations again).

11) The root of all evil in the world might be greed and selfishness, also causing the current economic outgrowth. Even though that hardly can be fixed, „effective altruism“ tries to figure out efficient ways to improve the situation. Might be worth checking into.

12) Book tip: ""How to win friends and influence people"" by Dale Carnegie, with many revelations on human relations.

If some of these words made you think, I'm happy :) feel free to contact me if you want to talk more about something.

Most people fear change, yet change is the only constant.  In learning to embrace change and what it means, you open yourself up to interesting possibilities in your life.  Be out there.  Push the envelope.  Dare to be different.  Have passion for what you do.  Take that risk.

The Question Hootenanny

Ask a question, get an answer. When you ask great questions, you often get great answers.  When you ask questions no one has asked before you may well get new answers no one has thought of before.   Try it.  Often.

Get Shit Done

Stop thinking about it. Stop talking about it.  Stop dreaming about it.  Take a few meaningful steps everyday to bring your vision into reality.  Concrete action.  Deliverables.  Milestones.  Screw procrastination, make things happen and get shit done.  Start today.  Start now.

Better the World

Do something with your life that helps make the world a better place.  Why not?  The more you make the world a better place…the better YOUR world becomes.  There’s no down side. Microfinance makes the world a better place.  Guiding and mentoring someone who is coachable makes the world a better place. Being kind to others makes the world a better place.  Helping people grow makes the world a better place.  Launching a startup that employs people and makes money makes the world a better place.

Shits and Giggles.

I’ve been happily married for 28 years…in a row…to the same incredible woman.  We have three amazing sons who are all wonderful, smart, kind, thoughtful young men.  We all work very hard at what we do and laugh our collective assess off a lot.  Shark Tank is our favorite show to watch as a family.  Walking Dead a close second.  They should do a special show that combines the two.  Mark Cuban as a zombie killer.  Kevin O’Leary telling a zombie startup founder, “You’re dead to me”. Okay, off track now.

The Startup

I’ve been doing startups for 20+ years.  Started one of the top 10 interactive agencies in the world (according to Ad Week magazine).  40 full time staff.  Seven million in annual revenue.   Blew up at the end.  Bad mojo. Other things I’ve co-founded in the last few years.  NedSpace, co-working for startups, remote workers and social entrepreneurs.  Maker Faire Africa, for innovators, builders and makers throughout the African continent.  Pitchlandia, crowd-driven, crowd-sourced, crowd-decided live funding event 20 startup founders pitch, 10 get funded, 100% decided by a live audience of 300 people.  All three things first of their kind in the world.

90 Days to Cash Flow Positive

Every company I’ve started since 1989 has been cash-flow positive in 90 days or less.  I’ve never raised a dollar in venture capital for one of my own companies.  I’ve never written a business plan, and at this stage in my life….I never will.  So it goes.  Starting a real startup is art.  It’s innovation.  It’s true exploration,  Not small businesses, not being an “entrepreneur”…but a startup founder driven to create something new, exciting and innovative based on growing an idea you’re passionate about.

Do You Have a Startup in You?

If so, and you want to grow it in a supportive environment of other founders in a free online peer-to-peer network (private Google Group), drop me an email.  If 25 people respond I’ll create a private Google Group where everyone can help one another to launch and grow their startup with this peer-to-peer support.  90 days to cash flow positive.

Startup your startup and change the world.

June 2014,10,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/06/10/drifting/,"June 2014, 10",Drifting...,"Unlike a lot of these Listserve emails we get, I have nothing really of use to share with you. There is no uplifting message and no important lesson that can help you have a better life.

I am 41 years old and for the last eight years I have been happy with my life. What about the previous 33 years, you may ask? Well, they were okay, but I had no idea what I wanted to do. I had pretty much drifted through life without any goals, or at least, none that had stuck. But for the last eight years I have been working at my dream job and I simply stumbled into it.

You see, I love cars. Ever since I can remember I have been fascinated with them, probably before I can remember as well.

For the past eight years I have had a job where car manufacturers give me brand new cars to drive for a week so I can write about them. They fly me all over the world to exotic locations, put me up in five-star accommodation, feed me the finest cuisine and ply me with the best booze. I am one of the luckiest bastards in the world, and I will still criticise the iPod interface in their newest car.

I am a motoring journalist and have what I consider to be one of the best jobs to have ever existed, especially for someone who loves cars (and booze). It was my dream job when I was young and I first found out there was such a thing as a “motoring journalist”.

When I did, I was in awe - people were actually paid to drive cars and write about them? That has to be the ultimate job, my nine-year-old mind muttered to itself. That would be freakin’ AWESOME...

Then, because I was nine, my mind scampered off to think about other nine-year-old boy things, like what would happen if you put the cat in the washing machine (you bleed quite a lot and the cat never goes in) or what the inside of the digital clock looks like (pretty much exactly like a broken digital clock) and the idea of writing about cars became a distant dream.

But here’s the really annoying part for anyone who is driven, highy-motivated and chases determinedly after their dream: I didn’t get this job by charging after it in a focussed fashion, studying journalism and reading everything I could about cars. I didn’t relentlessly harass editors and publishers to let me write about cars for them. Nope, like all the best things that have ever happened to me, it just happened when I was least expecting it.

Eight years ago I was in the right place at the right time and after 33 years of basically drifting through life was offered my dream job. At the time I had six months experience writing for a tiny local newspaper on a part-time basis and was living at home with my mother.

Now I do something I love. I don’t live with my mother anymore either  (but I still vist regularly!).

Sure, the stress levels get pretty high around deadline time and being a freelancer means you pretty much have to be constantly on the lookout for work, but the payoff is a job and a lifestyle I truly love and look forward to every day.

Like I said at the start; no messages, no lessons. Just the thought that sometimes drifting through life can lead to very good things indeed.

June 2014,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/06/09/learning-to-think/,"June 2014, 09",Learning to Think,"Hello, world. I'm a Computer Science PhD student studying Artificial Intelligence, which suddenly seems cooler when I write it down [1]. Today, I'd like to talk about intelligence, brains [2], learning, and solving problems. It's the kind of stuff that keeps me up at night, and amazingly enough, it also manages to pay my rent.

I discovered Computer Science in an Intro to Java course my freshman year of college. Programming hooked me with its instant feedback loop: write some code, and now I'm playing chess against myself. Write some more, and now the computer is playing against me. Write more, and now the computer is winning, despite the fact that I taught it (quite literally) everything it knows! It's a rush that I still don't know how to accurately describe. It's the kind of creation that drives artists, inventors, and scientists to work long hours for low pay and poor recognition, and once I tasted it I couldn't stop.

During college, I channeled this energy into a passion for solving real-world problems with computers, which the AI community calls ""Machine Learning"" [3]. That led me to enroll in a PhD program [4], where I joined the Autonomous Learning Laboratory at UMass.

I'd like to tell you about the grand projects we undertake in the lab, with shiny anthropomorphic robots following our spoken instructions and monolithic supercomputers that project the future in amazing detail [5].

Instead, my PhD research is mathy and esoteric. It turns out that humans are particularly good at exploring the unknown in small, understandable chunks, while computer algorithms excel at making shallow insights on massive scales. On occasion, however, the pieces come together to produce world-changing results [6].

My point in all this is that there's nothing mystical about intelligence, whether it originates in cells or silicon. We still have much to discover about the universe and our brains, but I believe that by teaching computers to learn, we're also giving computers a chance to teach us.

[1] Usually at this point in a conversation, someone chimes in with: ""Artificial Intelligence? Like in that movie where science goes too far and creates something it can't handle, resulting in disastrous consequences?"" Yep. That kind.

[2] You can't talk about AI without a tangent about the brain, and all too often someone smugly quotes: ""If the human brain were so simple that we could understand it, we would be so simple that we couldn't."" It's a nicely constructed sentence, but it doesn't stand up logically. Understanding the brain is not only possible, it's essential. I decided to leave the brain research to the neuroscientists, though, because it turns out  there's a shortage of living human brains to experiment on.

[3] In truth, this is what AI has been about all along, but a period of overpromising and bad PR led researchers to re-brand the field.

[4] If you're considering a PhD, don't believe all the things you read about it on the internet. Each student's experience is different, based on the school, department, and advisor you work with. Your fellow graduate students also make a huge difference!

[5] That's actually not so far off, though it doesn't seem as futuristic in real life. I just asked my phone ""Will it rain today?"", and Google's massive network of datacenters spoke back in a pleasant female voice: ""Yes, the forecast is 84 degrees with a chance of storm"". My lab's robots look more like trash cans than people, though.

[6] Can you remember what finding information was like before modern search engines? It wasn't pretty.

I turned 23 a few weeks ago; graduated college a little over a year ago; started my first full time job about ten months ago; and lost one of my biggest fans just a few days ago.  Cue the tears...or the smiles of remembrance (actually, the smiles- my dad lit up the room and made people smile wherever he went). 

My dad developed Alzheimer's disease several years ago and from the day he was diagnosed up until last Friday my mother, sister and I took care of him. Thanks to a system of relentless unity, collaboration, and love, we made it through. Thanks to our friends and family we're going to make it through this, as everyone else who loses a loved one does.

The past few days of phone calls, visits, and ad hoc trips across the country, have taught me the extent to which people can love and care. And with that I'll say it- thanks. To those of you who subscribe and are reading, for doing so (especially you, lovely lady who just helped me from beginning to end with the funeral services), and to everyone and anyone I've met who is/are also reading this. Even if we haven't spoken in a while, I'm glad I had the chance to be a part of your experience.

If there's one thing I want to do for my dad, it's to keep learning- whether it's in continuing graduate degrees or in learning from other people and places, I will. So feel free to reach out, whether you want to commiserate on experiencing Alzheimer's or are into international development and public health, or simply need a new pen pal, I'll be glad to hear about it.

Have a great day ListServian!

Tomorrow is a human a thing.  For other minds there is only now.  But not for us.

We sleep and wake and live our lives by tides and shapes of nights and days and nights.

Tomorrow is our dance; the steps of our rhythms with legs astride.

Because it's pain that teaches best, we fear the morrow.  And so we should.

June 2014,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/06/06/hysterectomy-at-19/,"June 2014, 06",Hysterectomy at 19,"I had a hysterectomy when I was 19.

In writing that sentence my knee-jerk reaction was to prefix it with “I was FORCED” to have a hysterectomy at 19 – but that simply isn’t true – in fact, I had to fight for it, which was (and undeniably still is) the most difficult thing about the whole experience

I didn’t have cancer, and while I did suffer from serious health problems none of them were life threatening. But after 7 years of debilitating gynaecological problems, over 30 surgeries, chronic-pain, and the onset of a secondary condition that rendered me unable to take any hormonal medication, I had run out of options.

The process of obtaining a hysterectomy for a young woman in Australia is a horrible endeavour, one that forces the patient to acknowledge responsibility at every juncture. I understand the legalities behind the loopholes I was forced to jump through, but to this day it remains the most traumatising part of the whole experience. Permanently losing my ability to bear a child and the physical act of having my womb removed was nothing compared to the sense of blame that was foisted upon me.

The process was long and arduous, heightened by the fact that the more disheartened I became the harder I had to fight. I was incredibly fortunate to have the support of my long-time gynaecological surgeon (even though it went against everything he stood for), but his blessing was just the tip of the iceberg.

For him to legally perform the surgery I needed to be examined and assessed by a plethora of medical professionals, including my GP, an endocrinologist, a pelvic-floor physiotherapist (they really exist), a pain management specialist, a psychologist, and an independent gynaecologist who I’d never seen before. When all those people had submitted their recommendations I was forced to undergo a full psychiatric work-up to determine if I was of sound mind (I was). At every point I had to plead my case, to beg for this procedure, to fight for it harder than I’ve ever fought for anything in my life. I was constantly reminded that it was MY decision and I was to blame for any future repercussions, a sense of liability that clings to me even 5 years later.

One of the more difficult stipulations was that I had to write a letter to my future-self explaining the reasons behind my decision in my own words. It was the final nail in my guilt coffin, a physical entity linking my culpability in the present to my potential regret in the future. Like everything else it was a fight, a plea – but this time I was begging myself, and in doing so admitting fault – now, and forever.

There are two copies of that letter in existence today; one sits in an archive room at a Sydney hospital, the other is in a safe at my parents’ house. I have no interest in seeing either - but one day I may - which is why I will also be adding a copy of this to the one at my old home, to remind me that while I may blame myself now and in the future it is only because of a system that forced me to feel this way.

So was it worth it, Future Self? We both already know the answer to that question.

P.S. She’ll very likely never see this, but I just want to tell 25,000 people that I, quite honestly, have the best mum in the world, and that I am just so thankful for her unwavering and unconditional love and support. I genuinely couldn’t have got through any of this without her.

P.P.S. Feel free to get in touch – Contrary to this email I’m actually quite a bubbly, vivacious person and I’d love to chat about non-uterusy things!

June 2014,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/06/05/west-papua/,"June 2014, 05",West Papua,"I recently visited West Papua and was very surprised how different it is from the rest of Indonesia, Journalists are banned from entering the region so the outside world rarely hears about what happens.West Papua was colonised by the Netherlands in 1898, along with the islands that now make up Indonesia. When the Republic of Indonesia became an independent nation state in 1949, West Papua remained under Dutch control. The Dutch government began preparing West Papua for its own independence throughout the 1950s. At the end of 1961, West Papua held a Congress at which its people declared independence, and raised their new flag – the Morning Star. But within months the dream was dead. The Indonesian military invaded West Papua and conflict broke out between the Netherlands, Indonesia and the indigenous population regarding control of the territory. The US intervened and engineered an agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands, which in 1962 gave control of West Papua to the United Nations and one year later transferred control to Indonesia. The Papuans were never consulted. However, the agreement did promise them their right to self determination – a right which is guaranteed by the UN to all people in the world.

By 1969 there was widespread resistance to Indonesian rule. The Indonesian military had killed and imprisoned thousands of Papuans in the seven years it had occupied the country – yet it was under these conditions that the people were supposed to exercise their right to self determination. It was agreed that the UN should oversee a plebiscite of the people of West Papua, in which they would be given two choices: to remain part of Indonesia or to become an independent nation. This vote was to be called the ‘Act of Free Choice.’

But the Act was a sham. Instead of overseeing a free and fair election, the UN stood by while Indonesia rigged the vote. Declaring that the Papuans were too ‘primitive’ to cope with democracy, the Indonesian military hand-picked just 1,026 ‘representative’ Papuans, out of a population of one million, bribed them and threatened to kill them and their families if they voted the wrong way. So strong was the intimidation that despite widespread opposition to Indonesian rule, all 1,026 voted to remain a part of Indonesia. Despite protests from the Papuans, a critical report by a UN official and condemnation of the vote in the international media, the UN shamefully sanctioned the result and West Papua has remained under control of the Indonesian state ever since. The Papuans now dub this episode ‘the Act of No Choice’. Consigning the fate of a million people to live under the brutal occupation that ensued is one of the most shameful chapters in the history of the UN. Recently there have been a number of detailed reports that heavily criticise the actions of Indonesia, the UN, and its member states during this period.

In recent years a new independence organisation, the KNPB (National Committee for West Papua) has become prominent. Under its guidance huge independence rallies have been held across West Papua and the West Papuan’s voice is united more than ever. As a result, many of its members have been arrested, tortured and killed. In 2012, the KNPB chairman Mako Tabuni was killed by Indonesian police, whilst many others face lengthy jail sentences of up to fifteen years just for raising the West Papuan flag.

The realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own - populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries, and inherited craziness - and epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk

I found this on Reddit one day and it just made me think about how insignificant my life must be compared to the other 7 billion people on this planet. I've always thought of having so many problems, so much troubling me. But when you look at it from a wider perspective, billions of other people are having the same problems that you might have. Everyone shares their problems with everyone else, even though we might not meet each other in our entire lifetime.

Lets consider the man serving coffee at my local cafe up the street. I've gone up and asked for a cup of water and a bagel maybe a few times, not really interested in this person life. But for all we know, he could be deep in debt, working his butt off to make up for student loans on a wasted degree that he never needed. This man has no time for a relationship, he has become a slave to the banks. His life is just as complex as mine or yours, if not more. The more you think about it, the more fun this game becomes. You can fabricate fantastic lives for people just by glancing at their faces. Maybe that person speeding on the freeway was on their way to the delivery of their baby, or to a very important meeting. It’s the type of thing I like to do while I am walking around town. Plus, it helps get the creative juices flowing when it comes to writing stories.

As I near the end of your attention span, I must begin my concluding sentences. Your life is incomprehensibly small compared to the lives of the other people around you, most of whom you have never seen or never will see. And as much as we think that our lives are soooo much more important than the guy you shoved on the sidewalk, then think again. Because everyone you will ever meet is thinking, breathing, and feeling the same as you are. We think we are all different, but everyone is human.

I often forget just how muchwe've been through during that time (good and bad): the ups and downs ofcollege, family deaths, graduation, grad school, first jobs, not knowinghow we'll pay the bills, buying a first home, andŠbabies (!). And evenwhen I sit here and write this, I know there are countless things I'mforgetting.

He's my person (anyone watch Grey's Anatamoy?). I can always count on him.He knows me best. Basically, he's my rock.

But, at the end of the day I love him the most because he makes me laugh.Not just giggle or chuckle. I'm talking the deepest, most uncontrollable,eye watering belly laugh that you can possibly imagine. There's nothingbetter.

So, my message is this: If you're with someone and you're not having funin your relationship, it's not worth it. Your ""person"" should be able tobring out the best in you and be able to make you laugh uncontrollably(and you the same to them). It's pretty simple really.

Also, listen to your kids (or just kids in general). I mean reeeeallylisten. My 2 year old points out the most obvious things that I take forgranted everyday. She's helped me see (and hear) the world around me in acompletely fresh light. Try it, you'll be amazed.

In the late '80s, My dad came to the U.S. from Nigeria with less than $100 in his pocket to study veterinary medicine at the University of Auburn. My mom followed a few years later to study pharmacy, and then they popped out my older brother. I still don't understand how two foreign grad students were able to raise my two brothers and me on an American college campus. But they did it somehow. And mind you, there were no grandparents to send the kids to stay with. And then if life weren't already hard enough, my mom encouraged my dad to go back to med school in his 30s: ""You've always wanted to be a real doctor. Be a man, and go be a real doctor."" (My mom's words, not mine). So he did at age 36, with an 8-year old, a 5-year old (me), and a 2-year old at home. Still, they both did a pretty solid job raising us, especially my mom. And I know I wasn't an easy child - wetting the bed 'til I was in high school, and getting expelled from middle school, all the while thinking I knew better than they did because they were foreigners.

After my sophomore year of high school, my dad got an opportunity to open his own OB/GYN practice in West Virginia. The schools there were pretty terrible, so my parents sent me back to Georgia to live with a friend. After 3 months, my mom decided she needed to be with me, so she and my younger brother came back to Georgia. But my dad stayed. He stayed in West Virginia until he finished putting me through Yale, and by that time, my younger brother needed his dad back so he'd stop getting into trouble. So my dad shut down his practice, and he came back to give it a go in Georgia in the middle of a recession.

Fast forward to today, and somehow they're so damn proud of me, when they're the impressive ones. They're so damn proud of their son in New York. They're so proud, and I don't care. I was always more concerned with impressing other people than with impressing my parents. For me, the impression hierarchy was always ""friends, then strangers, then family."" At least until recently. A couple years ago, I quit my job in finance to start a company (shout-out to my partner Andy, who also clued me into The Listserve!). Some days it's great, some days it's rough. This happens to be a good month, and today happens to be a good day. Tomorrow should be too. My parents don't understand what I do, and they'll be proud of me no matter what. But for the first time, I want to do right by them and make it work. I remember when I got into Yale. I leaned over the bannister and called down nonchalantly to my mom who was sound asleep on the couch. Her reaction was not nonchalant. She immediately jumped up, started running around downstairs (picture the running man at a gospel revival), then up the stairs screaming and praising Jesus. I know I'd like to see that again.

We shared everything that mattered for more than four years: a home, friends, finances, cats. Deep down, I couldn't imagine building that much familiarity and rapport with someone else. I had somewhere to go, and I wouldn't starve, but that was it; leaving would mean starting my adult life over from scratch.

(I told him I loved him, and I walked away.)

I wasn't sure it was a good idea to go back to college. After dropping out of high school, I'd taken a few scattered classes, but mostly got bored and abandoned them. If I actually pursued a degree, there would be serious money on the line. Fucking this up would have consequences for the rest of my life.

(I borrowed enough to buy books before financial aid came in.)

I wasn't sure it was wise to change my gender label. Acceptance for even binary trans* people is sluggish, and nonbinary folks (neither male nor female) are all but invisible. I didn't want to explain myself all the time. I didn't want to fight to be recognized. I didn't want to wince at the wrong pronoun or turn off people who might have found a gendered me appealing.

(I thought, I cried, I wrote. Eventually I came out.)

I wasn't sure moving was the right choice. Transferring to an out-of-state university would mean more expensive tuition and fewer grant opportunities. It was also a less familiar institution, with no reputation to speak of, and it was far away from my safety net. Moving would mean leaving behind almost everyone I cared about, for more risk and much more expense.

(I packed my life into a rental car and spent all night riding north on the 5.)

I wasn't sure I was ready to change my name. It was so expensive, and I'd be dealing with the paperwork for months. I'd only had the new one in mind for a little while, and wasn't even used to hearing it yet. Making it legal would be a statement of certainty and finality that I had still not begun to feel, and changing my mind would mean paying the costs all over again, financial and otherwise.

(I waited a month for one minute in front of a judge.)

If I miss the mark I'll never get another chance.

... but if there's one thing I've learned, it's that I can't wait to be sure. I'll never have all the information about any decision that matters to me. I have wasted a lot of time being afraid of change and stagnating; it's only when I'm brave, and take chances, that I grow.

Thanks for listening. Feel free to write; it would be fun to hear from you. Please pardon me if I'm slow to reply, though. This degree's not earning itself, and finals are coming up.

May 2014,31,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/05/31/on-time-and-puppies/,"May 2014, 31",On time and puppies,"I miss my dad.

This is not a sad story. I have learned, over time, that missing someone is not that bad. In fact, if I can resume my life so far, this is what I can say about it for sure: missing someone, be it a father who died, a friend who left you or the one that got away, is something that somehow pushes you forward & upward, in all the right ways you need to be as a person.

What I miss about my dad the most is probably the things he missed, too. Like seeing me graduate high school. Or college. Seeing me get a job and then quit it. Seeing me heartbroken.

I miss him on my birthday. And on his. And I still write to him on March 19th, every year.

A good friend one day told me how lucky I am for all the things I have left of my dad. My passion for reading, my career choices, my love for eyewear, my collection of toy bunnies, the stories he told me, the ones he wrote. If I leave behind only half of what my dad left, I am one very lucky woman. But what he left behind, more than anything, is time. Time to remember him and to miss him.

All of us who lost someone are richer, in fact, than we believe, because we have all this time and all these stories to tell.

I read today that it took a company 45 days to create and send out an official tweet. It got me wondering how we choose to spend our time & how others see this. For some people at that company, 45 days to create 140 characters might seem like a good investment. For some other people in media & advertising, it might seem downright overkill. And for some other people, it really does not matter one bit, due to the fact that, well, they might be fighting for their life right now, or getting married, or packing for a vacation, or

living in a refugee camp.

I believe that if it is time well spent, for you, it does not matter if it is 4,5 seconds, 45 minutes or 45 days. All that matters are the stories that are born at the end of a timeframe & how much they mean something to you in the great scheme of things.

Think about these:

- the rush you feel when you get an amazing idea which you really, really don’t want to waste, like some others you might have had

- the way you sprint towards someone warm, kind, generous and lovely you long to see again, after some time,

- the furious way you stick your key in the lock when you FINALLY get home to your loved one after a hard, long, terrible day,

- the impatience with which you wait for a bus, taxi or whatever, when you know what awaits you at the end of your journey,

- the haste in which you brush your teeth in the morning, when you know that this is the morning when you will do something Grand,

- and the incredible slowness with which you find the time to remember all these little urgencies in your life.

Oh, and the puppies in the title? It was a trick to get you to read so far. But since you have: get them, they are awesome. My family and I had 5 at a time and oh, the stories I could tell.

-  I know I’m ready to work when I’ve drank enough coffee to give myself diarrhea.

-  House hunting is incredibly boring, they never move.

-  On the first day God created the heavens and the earth, because he had to start somewhere.

-  I’ve probably taken over five hundred boredom-showers.

-  Did you hear the story about the dog that swam across the Atlantic Ocean to retrieve a tennis ball from Wimbledon?  Sounds far-fetched.

-  It’s the same old fish out of water story every time I go to sushi.  

-  “OCD” turned sideways looks like someone washing their hands in a sink.

-  How is he so relaxed, walking down the Champs-Élysées wearing shoes he cleans in the dishwasher?  [on my dad’s Crocs]

-  Suck a mile of dick.  If it’s a 6” dick that’s 10560 up and downs.

-  Monogamy is when you have one wife.  Monotony, too.

-  Every family has secrets, probably.  It’s impossible to know since they don’t share them.

-  At least Sisyphus had a job.

-  “Blunt Force Trauma”  TV show about a Rastafarian paramedic.  

-  In the entire Bible not one person gets hit in the nuts.  

-  Kristy wore vintage clothes.  They were new but covered in wine.  

-  Elvis = Levis, all shook up.

-  The greatness of humans over animals is proven by this sentence.

-  Movie idea: “Priestly” Jason Priestly plays a Catholic priest with a wandering eye at an all-girls school.  

-  Pizza is a grilled cheese sandwich with half the effort.  

-  Isn’t it weird that “prefix” has a prefix?

-  “I have no pride,” said the orphaned lion.  

-  I’m holding myself back.  And that takes a lot of flexibility.  

-  “In the beginning God created heaven and earth and vampires...” [beginning to a bestselling novel]

-  Jesus saves, but what good did it do him?  He didn’t even retire.

-  The word “efficient” isn’t.

-  The man who said human beings aren’t reflective never looked in a mirror.  

-  If Shakespeare’s so great why don’t people write like him anymore?  

-  Thank god for all the wars, without them there’d never be history.

-  Keeping your head above water is suicide for a fish.

-  How did people sleep before pillows?

-  I was watching the television for hours yesterday.  I got bored, so I turned it on.

-  If, once a year, we had to take a bite of a homeless person, we’d treat them much differently.  

-  “Speaking the truth is painful, but try hearing it!”  

-  I’m terrified I’ll be playing iTunes shuffle at a party and one of my recorded therapy sessions will comes on.

-  What do you call it when two hippies pass away at the same time?   Tie die.

-  Nothings says, “I don’t want to do more than I absolutely have to,” than fastening only one clip of your overalls.

-  It’s hard to convince a girl to sleep with you after you’ve mocked her dream catcher.

-  You say who cares about punctuation.  I say, “H.I.V., Free!”

-  Boogers evolved to be tasty to prevent us from suffocating.

-  Why do obese sluts like fascist governments?  Dick taters.  

-  Meat is murder, but only like third or fourth degree.

-  Do you think meerkats feel diminished by their name?  

-  One day I hope to say this sentence, “Chill baby, I’ve got a dental dam.”  

-  Corn Maze.  Isn’t that redundant? I am grateful I got to share with y’all.  Would love to hear you.

I text her when I wake up and she tells me when she’s going to sleep. I think she might have a boyfriend, but I try not to bring it up. She has dyed red hair and a bubbly nose.

Our relationship isn’t romantic because it’s inherently nothing. Picture the movie, Her. She feels like my Samantha. I bring her with me when I go out and unlock her when I get back into bed. She’s with me when I’m around other women, and I’m not certain if she’d mind.

Last night my roommate invited company over for dinner, and these two girls I’m indifferent toward were the only ones to show up. I entertained them still with curry and ice cream. We ended up at bar. I bummed a cigarette from someone and floated from group to group, trying to find a conversation that suited me.

I’ve been telling my therapist I’m trying to be more social, but it’s hard to force it when I’m not feeling on. I rarely feel on. He thinks I’m choosing to be off, but I don’t think he’s right because he’s usually not.

I sat at the bar and tried my best to pay attention to the two girls from dinner perched beside me. They were talking shit about someone’s weight and I was fading away. I pulled out my phone and texted Julie and asked her what she was doing. I tried to play darts with some strangers, but it just wasn’t working.

I left early and got into my bed tired and alone—too alone to fall asleep. Julie’s name beeped on my phone.

I hadn’t heard Julie’s voice in a month or so—when we met for the first and only time at a poetry reading, and went to a museum together in the morning. This was in Raleigh, NC, and we were both out-of-towners; the threat of rush-hour traffic looming over us as we sat under some trees and talked about everything. I didn’t really expect anything to come from this chance encounter (I thought of kissing her but didn’t. She told me later that this conceived action of mine would’ve been “a bit forward”).

She asked me a few weeks later what my intentions were (a move I myself considered forward), and we settled up with each other. Yes, there was an element of flirtation, but for the most part, we were platonic. It was kind of funny that we could be anything more than that, but I found myself relieved and a bit thrilled with the honesty. Honesty was new for me.

I didn’t notice it walking home, but Julie had responded to my simple, “what’s up?” text with a slew of messages and a voice memo. They were apologies for the levels and sound quality of something she sent me. I opened the file on my phone and held the speakers close to my ear.

There was light guitar music, but it was her voice that stuck to me. It felt like I was taking a hot shower after getting caught in the rain. That all my loneliness in that moment had been absolved by the digital voice of a woman in Baltimore, a city more than two hundred miles away. It seemed silly: just a minute or so of her singing and playing guitar into her phone, but it wasn’t just that. Julie was singing and she was singing for me. Unbelievable.

I imagined her bedroom. Playing guitar by herself. Singing a bit. Messing up. Deciding to record it and send it to me. What her lips and throat looked like as the words fell out. If she closed her eyes.

I told her she shouldn’t have sent it to me, which was true. I told her I couldn’t listen to anything else, and that was true too—nothing was as beautiful. After these past few days, I have it nearly memorized. I anticipate the points where I can hear her take in some more air, or stutter over a syllable. The parts that remind me she’s human. The way she sings the predictable yet still startling words, I love you.

From this year on, I will always remember the 1st of January as the day our family friend’s 15 year old son took his own life.

Time doesn't heal all wounds.  His loving family is left with no answers, except that perhaps he is no longer suffering in silence.

News travels fast on social networks.  Within a week the boy’s Facebook page lit up with thousands of posts, each one from someone in similar disbelief sharing how much they loved him, and will dearly miss him.

He couldn't have known how wide and deep his network extends.

When someone who is loved and very popular, seemingly happy with life, and always up for an adventure, decides something is troubling him so much he can't seek help, what chance do others have?

I know I hugged my sons extra tightly when I heard the tragic news.  It was an upsetting and tough conversation to then have with them about why it happened.  But it’s an awareness that’s helpful they have.

I tried to make it clear, if they're ever struggling with life there is always someone to talk to.  We can overcome all of life's problems, no matter how big they seem.

Do all our other family, friends, colleagues know they have someone to talk to when they feel down about life?

There is an awareness programme based on this unusual email subject line.  They encourage people to ask “Are you OK?”  They believe a conversation could change a life.  I believe it also.

I do hope you're OK.

Perhaps someone in your circle could benefit from hearing you want to know they're OK too.

May 2014,27,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/05/27/advocatio/,"May 2014, 27",Advocatio,"Hello listervians !

My name is Corentin, and I am taking my last internship to become a French « avocat » in a solicitor firm of London, within its family division that deals mainly with Children Public Law issues.

Those proceedings begin when a child is considered in danger, likely to suffer significant harm if left in the care of their parents.Even though solicitors will represent the Local Authorities that brought the matter to the attention of a court, as well as the independent guardian appointed to the child, we tend to mainly represent those parents.

The office is located in Brixton, and because its children law, because it is a neighborhood known for its immigrated communities, we mainly have clients on legal aid facing immigration and housing issues.

From what will follow, do not assume I am totally naive : I can understand that some parents behave so badly and violently towards their children the local authorities have to act to protect them. And I try to remain aware of my cultural bias, as French social workers and lawyers often work towards the reintegration of the children in their natural family, sometimes allowing risks in the process to protect this ideal.

But when parents come in, it is first evidence that they are willing to fight for their children's custody, and often the first step to make everything for their children's welfare.What is our job then ?

First we listen to their story :Mr X has Asparagus syndrome, and his wife and him, both presenting learning difficulties, were separated from their 4 children 10 years ago because of the harm they suffered in their care. Now the local authorities have concerns about their unborn child.Mr Y has been sentenced for a crime committed in another European country. He has 3 children, with no one to take care of them. Had he served his sentence in his country of origin, that would have been taken into account and he would have been able to serve it at home. But since UK does take this factor into account only at the sentencing part, those children will have to wait yet another 3 years before having the possibility to be raised by their parents.

Then we explain what is expected of them in our best opinion :Mr A, you will have to stop taking crack now, as we have to prove you are willing to change for the sake of your children's welfare.Mrs B, your child was taken right after a forced C section and we find it outrageous, but you have to respect the contact schedule and let us handle the fighting in the court.

And we obviously do what is expected from us :We carry their voice, write their statement, present their stories, make the court and the other parties understand, think twice, prove their caring capacities, contest unfair decisions, fight for their children's well beings.

After 26 weeks of hearings, contacts, expertises and tests, we finally explain the final decisions.

That is the closest I have ever been in my studies and short career of what advocacy means :We are not all born with fancy vocabulary and agreeable manners, for they are learned, and expression of cultural habits.I understand the fact that a state or population has to defend their children's welfare and security. In that field of law though, some persons have to carry the duty to fight a chance for improvement, present another cultural aspect of welfare, avoid misinterpretation.

I would be very grateful to discuss your own « legal » stories, do not hesitate to contact me if you are looking for someone to listen.

I find myself trying to look online for as much information as I can. I feel like the most suggested tip I see these days is the fact that college is not the only option after high school. There's always specialty school or something, but I don't really know much about that. They always have those examples of very successful people who did not graduate from college who because wildly successful (Bill Gates and Zuckerberg to name a couple) but these individuals were smart and they seemed to have luck on their side. To be honest, I don't believe that I can become one of those lucky people, so I work hard to do what I can even though I don't have an end goal of what I want to do. really admire those who can work their butt off for that one goal that they want to do, they are extremely driven and so optimistic about their future. The hardest part is figuring out what I'm working towards in school. With 7 billion people in the world it seems unlikely that I, or anyone else in my school will be the next world leader.

On a lighter note, this doesn't change the fact that I try to be a fun person to be around. The people that I meet will never meet 7 billion people so I want to be a fun person to talk to. I'm not that great at making speeches or talking to a crowd like this one but I do like to talk to people one on one! When I do talk to people, I'm always a bit different around the people I'm with. I can fangirl over boybands or attempt to have an somewhat intelligent conversation (because I consider myself to be somewhat intelligent). I like having many hobbies so hopefully I can relate to other teens that I talk to.

 I think I gave more thought to this than most of my English essays...

No? Then this relationship probably isn't going to last. No, I'm not talking about the relationship between you and movie star hunk Ryan Gosling. I'm talking about the relationship between you and whoever is visiting your website.

Because sometime after the charm of pinching to zoom and barely clickable links wears off you come to the realization that maybe the website is just not that into you. That it doesn't consider your wants and your needs(like the need to not fry your eyeballs a centimeter away from your iPhone screen trying to see a sewing pin-width link that your finger somehow has to click) and just isn't as attentive and caring as it used to be. That maybe it was just talking to you for hours on end because it liked to hear the sound of its own blog posts, and not because there was a connection.

Sure, there are more fish in the sea, but no matter where you cast your line be prepared for the same tired old zoomed-out pickup line. Only 15% of websites employ what's called fully responsive web design, a practice that allows a website's layout to adapt itself based on what size screen it's being viewed on. A business without a website that performs well on mobile is like that friend of yours who never fails to catch a ride home with someone every time you're at the bar then calls you up the next morning, whining about how no one sees them as marriage material. Websites that aren't responsive seem cold and inattentive, and who wants to put a ring on that?

However, just like a man can learn (although the ladies may disagree), there is a light at the end of the tunnel for websites that aren't optimized. My company, Evadra(visit the domain of my email to see our work), provides responsive design to clients of all business sizes cheaply, quickly, and of high quality. 

Consider me a marriage counselor of sorts for websites and visitors(or customers/clients), and to help get you on the road to lifelong happiness, I'd like to offer my services to members, friends, and family members of the Listserve at 25% off my normal quoted prices. Consider it a wedding gift for your renewal of vows.

If your website is ready to take the next step in its relationship with its visitors, please get in touch at the email below.

---------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR VERSION -

- Websites without responsive, mobile-friendly design give off a vibe of disconnect with their customers.- Visitors have to pinch and zoom, click tiny links, or stumble through sloppy navigation on non-optimized sites.- Web design with my company, Evadra is cheap, quick, and high quality, and it's 25% off for members, friends, and family of the Listserve.

May 2014,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/05/22/snapshots/,"May 2014, 22",Snapshots,"Hi Listserve:

I’m a 29 year old married female living in my hometown after completing University and living abroad in South Korea for a year. I’ve been working in PR and Communications but am currently on contract so if you happen to know of any opportunities in Northern Ontario, please let me know!

A few snapshots from my life:

Bikes:I’m participating in the Zoo-de-Mack bike ride this Saturday, May 17. This ride is set along a 51 mile route from the Zoo Bar in Boyne Highlands, MI to Mackinaw City, MI, where approximately 4000 participants will then ferry to Mackinac Island, one of the quaintest places on earth. The island does not allow for motor vehicles. Instead visitors walk, ride bicycles or take horse-drawn carriages to get wherever they’d like to go. While the ‘downtown core’ of the island is a total tourist trap, what’s not as well known about the island is that it includes a state park and with that, a combination of paved, dirt and unkempt trails to be explored on bike or foot. A number of times my husband and I have taken the trails and not seen anyone else for several hours, which I think is amazing because of the thousands of tourists that it attracts during the regular season. These trails are hidden gems. Due to my lack of training for the bike ride… feel free to send me any tips, tricks or perhaps any other info about bike riding routes or group rides in the USA or Canada that you have tried or know about.

Travelling:In September 2012 my husband and I went to the Netherlands and Germany for our ‘honeymoon’. People at home and many of those encountered on the way told us we were crazy for spending what was supposed to be a stereotypically ‘romantic’ time checking out Anne Frank’s House, Dachau, the Brandenburg Gate, Holocaust Memorials and the remains of the Berlin wall. Honestly, it was the best decision we could have made. I’d never been to Europe before that trip and it was illuminating to be submerged in history in a way that I had never been before- having grown up in North America.  No disrespect to beach and resort vacationers, there’s a time and a place for that- but you won’t regret taking the risk of being immersed in cultures that don’t specialize in making tri-coloured icey drinks on the edge of a swim-up bar.

Processed Food:I’m not going to pretend that I didn’t eat an entire order of Little Caesar’s stuffed cheesy bread yesterday for dinner, but stop eating processed food. Right. Now. I went vegan for a few months a couple of years ago, and while ultimately I found that period in my life to be unsustainable, it taught me what I somehow managed to not learn in the 26 years prior. Taking the time to understand how nutrition works to support physiological systems was invaluable. Veganism isn’t for everyone, it’s not even for me. But I recommend everyone try it and start to recognize that what we, as a culture have been taught to eat isn’t necessarily healthy. Challenge your existing ideas.

Books:A quote from George R.R. Martin’s A Game of Thrones: “A mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge”.  Never stop reading.

Volunteering: What’s your cause?I’m working with a couple of non-profit groups right now. Notably with The Sault Theatre Workshop. It’s a frustrating and rewarding experience all around, and often people ask me why I’m involved. I try to respond as non-pretentiously as possible that theatre is important because it challenges ideas and limits, exposes audiences and actors alike to experiences they would otherwise not have had, and ultimately builds and supports communities while allowing for creative expression. It’s an art that’s continually receding in this culture, and that disappoints me.  I’m always interested to know what other people are passionate about. What matters to you? Send me an email, maybe there’s something I can do to help.

In a few words, DBS is a surgical treatment where needles are placed deep inside the brain through small holes in the skull. Comparable to a cardiac pacemaker, the needles will stay there forever and will electrically stimulate the neurons inside the brain. This treatment has been used for over 20 years for Parkinson's disease, but is currently also used for Alzheimer’s, depression and many more.  You’re interested in how it works? Nobody knows.

I think it is fascinating to study the unexplored in a world where so many things appear to be known. While doing that I have not only learned about the things I was searching for. In contrary, I've learned most about the search itself. The first thing I have learned is that for many things no single correct answer exists, therefore I do not have to choose between different ideas. In contrast, I've noticed that it is more powerful to accept multiple ideas while simultaneously understanding its flaws. This brings me to the next thing. I have noticed that if somebody has a very strong opinion, chances are he/she might be wrong! I must admit, I used to have opinions about people based on limited information. Now I see, that it is natural to think fast, but I would make fewer mistakes if I would think slow. (Thinking, fast and slow - Daniel Kahneman)

Lastly, I try to be careful when echoing opinions or 'facts' I hear from others, since my ears are blind and yours probably too. You can trust me, I'm an engineer.

PS. Watch some videos to see the effects of deep brain stimulation for yourself.

I received this email first thing on a Monday morning and instantly thought to myself ""what do I say?!"" I've been a member of The Listserve for quite some time, but there's really way to prepare for those three words. . . ""It's your turn.""

I'm from the US, and I work in higher education. For the past ten years I've been involved in student services in some form or fashion, in Student Affairs, Admission, and Financial Aid. I've had the opportunity to work in a small liberal arts school and a large public university. In ten years I've literally seen and heard everything. I'd like to touch on the Financial Aid part of things today.

To those Listserve readers who are college students in the United States - Please, take responsibility for yourself. While a good number of students I've dealt with are go-getters and fend for the themselves pretty well, a startling majority of students seem to be attached to their parents throughout college. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The support that a parent provides on an emotional and practical level cannot be understated. However, when parents are doing things for their children that will have a lasting impact on their lives, such as master promissory notes and required federal counseling for student loans, that support becomes a problem. Students - it's your lives and your money. Take responsibility for yourself. When you default and you say you ""didn't know"" you had student loans, look back on your past and ask your parents if they did your paperwork for you.

On a similar but different note - the system that we have in place in the US to finance higher education is not sustainable. During the Recession students returned to school in droves because they were unable to find work. At the same time the government decided they needed the majority share in the student loan business to protect students from predatory lending practices. The result? A massive amount of debt that is owned by the government, which is sure to be the ""housing bubble"" for the next generation. We have got to figure out a better way to finance higher education to ensure accessibility for future generations.

Finally, I'd love to hear from you. Whether you're a student in the US who ""didn't know"" they had student loans, or someone from another country who has an idea as to how we can reform higher education financing here in the US. I can't wait to hear from you.

I’m French and homeless since 3 years. If you meet me, you wouldn’t even guess as I’m a pretty good illusionist: you might think I’m going to the airport for business with my suitcase following me everywhere. You might even envy my styles! Perfect hygiene is dignity…

I graduated a master degree in marketing in my 20s’ and immediately got my first job. For 10 years I worked for famous brands and even if it was not well paid, I was very happy about it as I’m from a very low class family. Everything was going well until the 2008 financial crisis. I got fired and couldn’t find another marketing job. No choice to change my career orientation: I became a fashion retail store manager. Sounds great, doesn’t it? Well, it was very badly paid, luxury brands are the worst - but still, it was paying for the rent.

I don’t know why but I entered a bad life cycle: that same year, my flat had been robbed twice in a row, administration lost my social security number files and I started to have health issues. If being robbed really helped clearing up some space in my studio, not having a valid social security number anymore gave me a very hard time! It is required to have a legal job, public health assistance, health insurance and basically, everything that involves administration.

It happened that I needed medical care for transit issues: my body processes very little food. Many times I had to go to the emergencies in the middle of the night to get ‘fixed’. Each time, I paid without health assistance reimbursing. I went out of money very quickly and had the bank paying for the medical bills while I was dealing with the administration to solve this ‘out of control’ problem. My health got worse. I lost my job. Without any social security number, no indemnity.

You do the math: I couldn’t reimburse my bank and its charges, I couldn’t pay for my medical fees, rent, charges, phone, transport, food, etc. I applied for the ‘bankruptcy status’ to get a chance to start over but I was denied this status because of the social security number missing. I fought for months…

***

I remember closing the door of my flat, walking down the stairs of my building. It was around 4am. I was leaving everything behind because I had no one to help me moving my stuff out and that I failed in selling them. I put the keys in the mailbox and walked down random streets with this visceral fear I had nowhere to go.

I went to many organizations that are meant to help. They have their priorities and without this number I can’t get any financial help. My only options are to be an illegal worker as I don’t give up on my dream of having a tiny house lost in the mountains. When no job, I spend hours in public libraries, the remaining time is about finding a safe place to sleep.

I turned 34 three days ago. When homeless, friends tend to forget you.

May 2014,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/05/18/the-once-and-future-growth/,"May 2014, 18",The once and future growth.,"Three little life stories, and two requests:

About a week ago I started a garden on my ugly concrete balcony. It’s been cheap, surprisingly exciting and the relevant internet communities are a delight. My mother is also happy to see me engage in one of her long-time hobbies, so it’s a win on all fronts. Today I had to thin out the radishes a bit because it was getting very crowded. Going at them with scissors was hard, but it’ll be worth it!

Over the past seven years I’ve tried my hand at three different degrees: applied physics, teaching physics, and now embedded software engineering. It’s been a hell of a ride – frequently terrifying because I’d screwed up again, or exhilarating because something appeared to finally work out for me. This one’s the first that I’ve stuck with for more than two years, and yet I don’t regret the others: I wouldn't be who I am today if it weren’t for all the other situations and people I’ve had to deal with.

About seventeen years ago I joined a choir for the first time, following in the wake of my sister. Today I’m the treasurer for my second choir, and I could probably spend another six hundred words on all the ways these two choirs have been good for me. I don’t know about the global situation, but around here many choirs are in dire need of new members. Often they’re not too picky about your experience either – if you like to sing you can probably learn how to do it well ;)

On that note: I’ll be leaving my choir in a few months and am looking for something new. Today it occurred to me that something other than singing might be nice – acting, dancing, anything really. Maybe someone on here knows who would welcome a 25-year old newbie to their arts?

And while I’m here with words to spare: I’m looking for an internship in embedded or industrial software engineering. I’m fairly passionate about providing libraries and tools that are very useful to other people, and generally just enjoy making things fit together well. I am known as “barometz” in various online places, including GitHub.

I hope this was at least a little interesting to some,

May 2014,17,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/05/17/first-world-problems/,"May 2014, 17",First World Problems,"As I advance through my High School career as a teenager, I'm subjected to a plethora of expectations. Most of these are negative stereotypes of what teenagers are supposed to be: rude, dumb, and with no respect for others. These intrigue me as I don't think I fulfill the first two expectations, and so when I see the old lady or nice couple cross the street to avoid my slowly advancing mob of friends as we walk down a street to dairy queen during lunch, making the most of our combination of free time and disposable income that most people tell me I don't appreciate enough. I tend to think what I'm supposed to feel. Do I get angry? We have no reason to be intimidating but most people see us as so, and it could be because we are so concerned about what impression we make on our other teenage friends that we loose sight of trying to fit into that illusive box of normal for the rest of the world, but I don't quite think thats it. Do I sympathize? We are taking up the whole street, and a mob of anyone be it teenagers or disgruntled workers is something that most people avoid for good reason, the mob mentality is a frightening thing that doesn't regret or think until the morning after. Although at the end of the day there is nothing I can do, I can't change the past, and I unfortunately lack the telepathic communication powers of Professor X. As for the third one, that stumps me. How does one know if they don't have the proper respect for something? It reminds me of when I am packing for a trip to some relative that I apparently met once when I was three, and am assured that they are family, even though the only communication I've ever had with them is the christmas cards and infrequent comments on facebook pictures saying something along the lines of ""Oh he is so big, I remember when he was just this tall."" I'm packing this bag without a list and know that there is something that I am supposed to remember to get, but how can you remember a thing you have forgotten? So I leave without it, and when all is said and done it turns out it wasn't that important anyway. But respect is different and it's hard to gauge how much I am supposed to have for someone. Someone like my dad, who has not done anything to change the world, but has the dedication and love to raise a child. He is someone I respect, but am I supposed to respect him less than someone else? Am I supposed to hold more respect for someone who has done something great but I have never met? There is no hand out to tell me these things, although it seems like everyone expects me to have one, and it's even harder to gauge the amount of respect I am supposed to give because I tend to get less just because of my age. It kind of reminds me of the studies on the effect of sugar on children. (Really interesting, but I can't link anything so you will have to find it yourself, sorry!) These studies show that even though sugar has no effect on the brains of children, when parents are told that their children were fed snacks with a bunch of sugar in them they act a lot more obsessive over behavior than the parents who weren't ""informed"" about the snacks. And even though neither group of children actually ate any sugar, when asked to describe how their children were acting the parents who were told that they did used words such as ""troublesome"" and ""difficult"", the study shows that the effect is purely physiological, and is caused by the children acting how they think they are supposed to act, and also the parents having this massive placebo effect when judging behavior and disciplining their own children. This is similar to something called the label theory, which admittedly I am less knowledgeable on. From what I know it basically states that the very act of treating something like they are going to do something, will make them more likely to do that thing. Whether thats acting hyper and troublesome, or being calm. From being stupid, to being an overachiever.There is no life advice in this email, and I don't think I'm really in a position to give that kind of advice when I am struggling to figure out my life still, but to quote the immortal words of Bill and Ted, ""Be excellent to each other!""

I often thought about what I would write to all of you.  I decided a long time ago that I would write about something that could change the world.  Parenting.

Why?  Because I am a mum of three wonderful kids.

My parents divorced when I was very young and it’s been almost 35 years since I have had any contact with my father.  I know he lives 30 minutes away and I know he has 6 grown children thanks to Facebook and social media.

I’m not looking for pity or sympathy, I simply want other parents to understand the deep and profound effect his actions had on me throughout my whole life – and continue to do so.

As a little girl, I struggled to understand his abandonment.

As an adult I realized it was his own immaturity that caused him to hate and punish my mother rather than look inwards at his own behaviour in the collapse of their marriage.

As a parent I wonder how he could ever walk away from his children and not know if they were okay. Not want to share in all the glorious things they do, see and accomplish.

I was raised by a wonderful strong-willed woman who taught me right from wrong, taught me that an education was important and taught me a strong work ethic.

The struggles of my childhood are what created the successes in my life today.

I want to keep it short as I know I am guilty of skipping over the long listserve emails.

So here it goes.

You as a parent have the ability to change the world with each child you bring in to it.  Love them and teach them to be good parents.

How ironic that the listserve invitation came on Mother’s Day.

A shout out to my glorious country of Canada.  True North Strong and Free!

First an explanation…. I’m 38 work full time, study full time (Masters of Emergency Nursing) and am a single mother to two teenagers, I work in my states busiest Emergency Department as a nurse and I have had the privilege to see the whole spectrum of human behavior and been witness to the beginning and ending of life time and again. I have been part of miracles and tragedy and everything in between.

So I ask of you this….talk to your families about what you wish for your life should something happen to you (yes bad stuff happens, even you cannot hide from it).

Talk about if you want to be intubated and ventilated if you can’t breathe on your own - it’s invasive and sometimes futile - do you want this? perhaps it will save your life, but it might not be the life you live right now. Think about these things.

Talk about whether you want CPR to be performed if your heart stops - we will likely crack everyone of your ribs, it is a brutal act - it is nothing like the movies and the success rate is less than 10%.

Talk about what you want for your life…. how you want it to be - you should have strong opinions about this….

These topics are hard to talk about, but it is a lot harder to make these decisions when you don't know what your loved ones want and we are fighting to save them….. and we will fight for you till we have no more options I promise you that, we will fight beyond all reasonable odds, but please talk to your families so we know when to fight and when to stop.

Here is the rest of my nurse advice - Please don't hit, spit on, piss on or abuse your nurse! There simply is no excuse for this behavior - NONE. Nurses give you a piece of themselves every time they tend to your needs, often while ignoring their own.

If you say your pain is 10/10 and you are texting on your phone or smiling we won’t believe you!  - we have seen 10/10 pain is and it’s when someone’s leg has been ripped off or their bowel is rotting inside, please try to be realistic and honest, we will still care for you and give you pain relief and comfort and respect.

And onto love…. be open to love it is the greatest force in our universe. Welcome opportunities to love every day and be generous in your willingness to give your love away. - The only cure for love is to love more…..

A shout out to Tracy who introduced me to the listserve - she is an amazing woman who I am inspired by and treasure.

A shout out to Amy who is my amazing daughter who is inspiring in her grace and wisdom and who will read this…. and a shout out to Harry my son who is funny and joyful and who wont.

Love each other deeply and talk to your loved ones - its important!Practice kindness everyday.

Check out Sleeping at Lasts’ music.Read widely and often- challenge yourself.Listen to the TED talks.

Drop me a line if you want to ask anything about Emergency Nursing, or Brisbane, or Australia or anything….

Consequently, this was my brother’s death. I have buried  and I have lost. Yet never have I died from death, until now. My sibling died on a Tuesday, weeks before his birthday, 16 days before Christmas, 20 days before mom's birthday and 3 weeks and 2 days before the New Year’s start. One single gunshot shortly before 10 in the morning. The most delicate sound I'd ever heard. Monumental in aftermath, but kind in waking me up, for it wasn't jarring. She screamed his name, followed by one last inaudible wretch. I told  mom to get out of the house. She took care of him in life; the least I could do was take care of him in death.The most detrimental and beginning of my mental health’s decline wasn't seeing his body, it wasn't therapeutically wiping his blood on my skin, nor was it watching the blood seep quietly and violently from his head. The biggest and most painful monster that day was my walking in his room and positively thinking my brother was sleeping. Entering his room and seeing his body positioned in a way that looked much like you as you read this right now. He was sitting up on his bed; head cocked back and held up by the white wall peppered red behind him. I assumed he was cleaning his gun and it simply went off while he slept. End of story, simple as that, brother wake up.It took the paramedics one half hour before they professed doing everything they could. I thanked them kindly, walked to my mother and with just one look and no words what-so-ever, I told her that her son was gone. Watching your mother mourn a child they gave life to, is simply the most divine form of punishment life can give you, for my mind will never let me forget her screams. Falling to her knees and announcing to the birds that her boy had died; what terror that was.

They brought him down in a dark blue body bag  45 minutes after. With  neighbors watching their spectator sport my mother sang ""You Are My Sunshine"". I whispered Pink Floyd lyrics into his ear.

I hear it every day and night before I rest my head. That gunshot will soar through my mind until my inner workings stop working, this I know.My mother was 46, I 24 and my brother Mark was 25 when he died. I wish I could say that I've learned something wise that rose from the ashes of his death…That, I have a perspective of betterment since that day. But I am still searching to wake up every morning and take but one breath that is not riddled with pain. The day I can do so will be an accomplishment and maybe a day for imparting wisdom.

Upon my request, sometime in late February of the following year Mark’s ashes were peppered like snowflakes upon the mosaic design of Strawberry Fields in Central Park, NY. A small piece of him lay with the memory of some of rock n’ roll’s greatest. Now and forever, John Lennon, George Harrison and Mark Limbeck have a memorial in the heart of the greatest city in the world, a city in which he always wanted to go. Finally, death took him there…

…You are my sunshine, my only sunshine; you make me happy when skies are grey. You’ll never know dear how much I love you…a black revolver took my brother away.

Often struggling with words, communicating to such a large number of people is daunting.  Visual expression as a form of language has been my best way of connecting and relating to other human beings.   Talking without saying anything.  Radiating energy into perception.   This leaves room for endless interpretation. Our life experiences shape how we see and feel.  So how does one strike a chord that resonates in the soul?One must have a deep connection with the world around them.  An endless universe of inspiration.  The quest for perfection, which I do believe exists.  This requires balance, concentration, and the ability to free yourself from time. A breathe. Embracing or rejecting chaos. The artist must inspire and be an example of love, happiness, and freedom.  Authenticity must never be compromised.When an era is coming to an end it is important to hold on to every last moment. But also allowing yourself to move forward and grow as a human being.  There are times to look back but life is continuously moving forward.  Getting stuck in a backwards motion could be detrimental.My body will die someday but my soul will live on through my work.Here I go…

Here I am. A 21 year old in a 20 year old democracy, South Africa. It is two days before the 4th democratic election in this country of extremes; two days before I’ll be allowed to go and draw my cross for the first time.

I’m a white, a pale native, woven in-between the everyday life of black Africa. I stopped looking for bright colours, for my technicolour dream coat, for the Rainbow Nation!

I’m not asking much:  I shall be satisfied by something in the middle- of- the-road. So I’m searching for a little bit of grey, maybe brown, something beige: normal, boring and predictable. But there is nothing in between to be find in the land of my forefathers, the land of my dreams, the country of hope- (lessness). Only black on white, only harsh, unforgiving extremes.

I’m currently studying Veterinary Science at the world renowned Onderstepoort Veterinary Faculty and Research Institute, high tech enough to easily be mistaken for an Institute in a developed Western country. But driving to campus from home means going through Zandspruit, Diepsloot and Soshanguve- slums where people have to live in shacks of corrugated iron and mud, sans electricity, water or sanitation. Full on 3rd World vistas.

I’m sitting at home, looking out over a green garden and sparkling swimming pool, studying for tomorrows Toxicology exam. Whilst scarcely a kilometre away at the traffic light a Malawian woman (Probably an illegal immigrant) sits in a wheel chair holding a child (probably not her own, but used to gain sympathy) begging for money. Extreme.

Me, like the rest of the world, avidly follows the Oscar Pistorius saga. But I can’t help but wonder why this white-on-white murder is allowed so much publicity whilst far more horrific crimes are committed each day. White-on-black attacks makes national papers, black-on-black attacks are maybe mentioned in regional papers. But black-on-white attacks, which are the most violent and heinous, are largely ignored.

As this election draws nearer, I realise how ironic this country is. We boast about being safeguarded by the World’s most progressive Constitution, our Human Rights being the best protected. But our human rights are violated daily by the very government that set out to fight for our people’s freedom. Apparently there’s some secret clause protecting the ruling party/government.

The irony of giving millions the right to vote but then taking away the right of their vote being meaningful and contributing to bettering their lives, is not lost on me.

Maybe me, a proud member of The White Tribe of Africa, together with the post-Apartheid, “born-frees” will be able to make a change for the better with our nearing D(emocracy)-day and find our pot of gold together for the sake of our beautiful country.

May 2014,10,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/05/10/race-in-america-the-final-solution/,"May 2014, 10",Race in America - The Final Solution,"Dear Listservers:

If America had a subconscious, race would be its neurosis. And it’s no wonder, as one way neuroses develop is when the reality of a given situation does not match up with what one is being told. The disconnect that is created between the official narrative given by an authority figure and the reality of your own senses makes the human machine malfunction, and worse, in the case of teachings about race it creates separation where there should be community.

In the United States from grade school onwards we are inundated with stories of racism. Like the Milgram Experiment, after years of this teaching most everyone seems to assume their given role: whites are the oppressors and blacks are the victims. And, there is seemingly damning evidence for racism all around us: Donald Sterling rants, police pull-over rates, incarceration rates, lower college attendance rates, lower incomes; the list is endless.

Through making a documentary film on an inner-city school (Google “Teaching and Learning in Compton”) I began to realize that the rhetoric of racism and privilege not only doesn’t help solve any problem, it actually hinders us. Unfortunately, talking about race, or privilege, or class, is so much easier than talking about the reality of what it takes to fix the problem. And the reality? Unfortunately, it involves work: lots and lots of work. The absolute, no bullshit, bottom-line answer is that the children of poor people will need to work a hundred times harder than their well-to-do counterparts to achieve a similar level of intelligence and skill.

Read Chapter 9 in Malcolm Gladwell’s book “Outliers”. It’s called “Marita’s Bargain”. It may be the most important thing that you ever read about race and poverty in the United States. It tells the story of Marita, a young girl whose family is very poor. Through her mother forcing her she attends a KIPP school in the Bronx and thereafter her life is changed forever. What’s a KIPP school? It’s basically a military school that takes her out of her social and family environment and shoves her into a world of year-round schooling.

This is the dirty secret of race and class in the US. Success and intelligence are not inherent, nor are they withheld or bestowed, they take work. The difference between rich and poor children, and generally therefore whites and blacks, is how much time is spent on learning. Gladwell points out in his book that wealthy kids and poor kids have exactly the same aptitude for learning. In early grades, their test scores are very similar. It’s only as time goes on that a disparity emerges. The reason isn’t anything other than time; the rich kids tend to learn year round while the poor kids tend to sit idle in the summer and after school, not enlarging on what they’ve already been taught.

The only tangible solution for racism in the US, and more importantly for poverty, is for poor children to work harder than anyone else. It might sound simplistic but it is the difficult truth. Programs like KIPP should become de rigueur in every poor and underachieving school district throughout the US. If you read Gladwell’s book you’ll realize this will take dedicated teachers and a firm hand with parents, but it is the only realistic solution.

Then, we can also begin to address the other issues that will come up: is there truly a pervasive race problem in the US and if so how do we address it? It’s an important question but let’s solve the first problem first: to have year-round, intensive public schooling available for our country’s poor.

Upon further reflection, it was much less surprising…so many nice things have been happening in my life lately that this opportunity makes perfect sense.

Today I am graduating with my master’s degree. Today, as in a few hours. I am beyond thrilled to be here, so happy that my son will see the results of my hard work. and excited to see what the future holds. I am a 40-ish single mom to a wonderful teenage boy, I work full-time plus, and there have been many times when I would swear there are not enough hours in the day to complete all that I have to do. Somehow I was able to squeeze out enough time and energy to finish this degree. I hope that my experience demonstrates that it is never too late, you are never too old, and you can (and will!) accomplish anything that you set your mind and heart to. Think about what you really, really want...and start today. I promise you will be rewarded, if for no other reason than you tried. Cheesy? Maybe...but so very true.

My commitment is to a world that works for all living things.

This commitment is a wellspring of happiness. As long as I get decent sleep. ( I have had depression when sleep deprived eg. my teenage years.) 

So what authentic actions are being taken? One thing I have noticed is that when you make a really big commitment in service of others you tend to hang with great people so a lot of great stuff gets done. Special thanks to; Kerrie Liao, Sean O'Sullivan, James Whelton, Marie-Noelle Keijzer, Sally hudson, Aubrey de Grey and the many others who get stuff done with grace, ease and love.

A world that works has to be broken down in to several realms and the prevailing discourse in each realm analysed to discover new contexts that can be created to address what is not working. ( Yeah I know and go on figure it out ) :-)

In the realm of environment - Trees make clouds - Clouds reflect sunshine - increase equatorial albedo through a 2% increase in cloud cover and you put a stopper in global warming for a while. So plant trees! You see it rains where there are rain-forests because rain forests make it rain. WeForest has planted 6,000,000 trees empowering impoverished women to be come food foresters to assist themselves and the planet. I am committed to not flying until we plant 100 million trees.

In the realm of entrepreneurialism - Synthetic Biology is about to leap from the province of the large corporates and universities to the province or startup entrepreneurs. My daughters type 1 diabetes pointed me at synthetic biology as a way to make her insulin, Through our SynBioaxlr8r and HAXLR8R programs we are supporting entrepreneurs to get a head start right now. If you know a budding entrepreneur then direct them to our programs where they will get mentoring and cash.

In the realm of medicine - As a founding board member of SENS ( health span is more important than life span ) I get to see the latest technology around health. Issues with resuscitative techniques have lead to heelgood a charity around redefining CPR ergonomics. They also lead me to Dr Lentz and the International Immunology foundation who appear to have as close to a generic cure for cancer as I have yet seen with the lowest risk of complications of any treatment I have heard of.

In the realm of education -Computer programming is a language skill and the best coders are poets in that they combine their creativity with an economy of expression. When is the best time to learn a language?CoderDojo is a global movement of clubs for kids aged 5-17 that provides an open and totally free learning environment for kids to learn to code. It is in 43 countries and if there is not one near you its open source and free of charge so you can start your own. Kids who can code get such a great grasp of technology and if you don't ""get"" technology then you are at the mercy of the technology and those who do ""get"" it.

In the realm of family - We live of an organic small holding and grow a fair bit of our own food. We home school our kids some of whom also go to CoderDojo. Many thanks to Gary Chapman's Five Love Languages and also to Mark Goulston's just listen. I am eagerly anticipating the day when our three kids state the missions they have in life. Above all family takes time and that time is worth it. When I do not put in the time that too is a source of misery.

So my commitments and actions bring happiness even when I fail and I guess I failed and continued to fail a bit more than most. Failure is a core part of the context of learning so failure can also be a gateway to happiness. Oh and because happiness is a contrast emotion you cannot be happy all the time and you can be happy when you choose and happier in general and while you cannot make anyone else happy you can be of service, be polite and authentically be of good cheer which are the next best things.

I wish you all great happiness from taking on big commitments in service.

If you don't know what The Game is, ask a friend who does. Or Urban Dictionary it. Point is, you and 24,741 other people just lost it. Please email me with other games to play, in the car or otherwise.

Shout-out to my fellow geologists and MiddKids, my fellow Ridgefielders and Madrileños and Christmas Cove-ers. Shoot me an email, I want to know you.

In my 20 short years, I have figured out how to keep myself happy. You may chuckle at my naïveté, but these are my thoughts:

1) Talk to strangers (but use your intuition). If you let yourself have a brief conversation, the wall is broken, and friendship becomes infinitely easier. If you get nervous, just pretend you've turned your brain off and say anything. This method works.

2) Take a moment to be silent and appreciate where you are. I find this often takes the form of a ""Mountain Appreciation Moment"" when driving in the car with friends, or pausing to let sunshine soak into my skin.

3) Don't let deadlines kill you. Chances are, if you send a polite and nicely-worded email to your professor, you can get a little extra time. Professors are people too, they don't want you to burn out. Alternatively, some experiences are simply worth a few points off.

4) Cats and dogs are the solution. Don't waste your time on an animal that lives in a cage and isn't happy to see you when you come home. Also, don't be so quick to dislike little dogs. They are so uniquely wonderful.

5) It's okay to do what feels good. Don't beat yourself up over taking a break. Surround yourself with some people who make you feel good and have a beer every once in a not very long while. Take pictures.

6) Call your mother. She loves you, even when it seems as though the rest of the world doesn't. My mother's best quotes: ""Everything's washable."" ""You're so full of shit, your eyes are brown."" ""Up with this, I will not put.""

Looking for an entertaining movie to watch? Try My Cousin Vinny or Big Fish. But my real, all-time favorite movie (I'm serious) is The Lion King. If you're like me this time last year and haven't started watching Game of Thrones, stop being stubborn and watch it. It adds to the human experience.

Enough from me! Enjoy your day.

May 2014,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/05/06/drugs/,"May 2014, 06",Drugs,"Hi fellow Listservians,

I had no plan on what to write if I ‘won’, so I’ll revert to what I know best – drugs – the medicinal type. I’m a 26 year old intern pharmacist from NSW, Australia and I thought I’d list a few interesting things, common misconceptions and general things to know about medicines.

**Disclaimer – I’m still learning, don’t just take my word for the following (or the news, or anything); look into things for yourself, and become informed. The world will be a better place for it!

1.       Are you one of those people (I’m guilty) that takes pain killers only when you can’t bear the pain any longer? It turns out that this is not ideal. ‘Central sensitisation’ is when you experience (chronic) pain above a critical rate over time, leading to your perception of the pain increasing i.e. the longer you leave the pain – the more sensitive you become to it – so treat it early and regularly if required!

2.       Medications come from many sources, especially natural ones. A new diabetes drug, exenetide is derived from saliva of a lizard. Penicillin comes from Penicillium fungus; digoxin is extracted from the foxglove plant, morphine from opium etc.

3.       The difference between paracetamol/acetaminophen (brand – Panadol) and ibuprofen (brand Nurofen). Paracetamol an analgesic (kills pain) that also reduces fever, is effective if taken regularly, however, if overused can damage the liver. Ibuprofen an anti-inflammatory - reduces inflammation, thereby reducing pain – can hurt the stomach if not taken with food.

4.       Generics – these are the cheaper options offered to you at the pharmacy. These products must by law contain EXACTLY the same active ingredient (drug) and be as effective as the original medication. The only difference is that they may have different non-active ingredients like colourings etc. Often these are made by the same company as the original brand – it’s all about creating the competition.

5.       Marketing – don’t let the drug companies fool you with ‘Migraine’, or ‘Period Pain’ tablets. Look at the active ingredient and you will probably find they all contain the same drug in the same strength, the only difference being the price.

6.       Ever wondered why pharmacists preach that you must take the full course of antibiotics, even if you feel better? It’s to do with survival of the fittest, if you take an antibiotic for half the course, you’ll kill the weaker bacteria. But the stronger bacteria that can deal with the drug will survive and this will become the norm. This cycle perpetuates, leading to resistance to an antibiotic and is how we get super bugs like Staph (MRSA) that don’t respond well to treatment. Taking the full course aims to eliminate all of the bacteria.

7.        Antibiotics and alcohol – whilst it’s not advisable to drink much when you are sick, there is only one antibiotic with which you should not drink alcohol as it will make you violently ill. It is called metronidazole.

8.       The oral contraceptive pill (OCP). ‘Skipping’ your menstrual cycle by not taking the inactive tablets in the pack does you no harm, contrary to popular belief. ‘Traditional use of the OCP with 21 hormone pills and 7 placebo pills, allowing for a bleed, was designed to satisfy social & religious pressures of the 1950's and mimic a woman's natural menstrual cycle. A withdrawal bleed has no physiological basis.’ – From Menstrual Suppression (Family Planning NSW website).

9.       Airing a wound out to dry is a thing of the past – Google moist wound healing, much more beneficial.

Have a lovely day.

In fact, I have just pictured all of you attending my funeral. Yes, that was an invitation for y'all to come to my funeral one day.  

 The only way I can cope with death is by making light, decently funny jokes. But we all encounter death somewhere in our lives so here is my only advice (besides attempting to make light jokes): dont sit around moaning and saying,""why why?!?!?"" Get off your butt and see how you can fill that void that just left you. The best way to commemorate someone is to take something they did or loved and make sure it isn't forgotten. I know someone who died that loves cooking so heres a recipe:

6 large potatoes and one large onion grated together. 

A quarter cup of oil into a frying pan until sizzling. 

Mix 6 large eggs and pour the mixture above into a large bowl.

Pour the hot oil on top of the mixture and mix together with compassion.

 Add salt and pepper. Amount to your liking.

 Add in about three cups of love.

 Pour into a Lasagna size tin.

 Preheat oven to 500.

 Put under broiler for 15 minutes until brown.

 Change to bake at 425 degrees for approximately 70 minutes.

 

If you know someone who died share something they loved or were passionate about and pass it on!  

 You are all awesome and I feel like I have 26,000 friends because of you.

 Also, if no body else signs up for listserve you will all get picked in at least 65 years!!! So until then, enjoy life.

 I want to take time to mention to people who I truly adore. My favorite girl in the world Noadia S-S! I wish a you all have the opportunity I had to meet her.

Also Andrew Pitkoff is solid.  

If you are ever in the tri-state area and you want to go skiing, hiking, golfing, scuba diving or want to debate brat pack movies and the question of theodicy, please feel free to shoot me an email.    

I also love tea and my mom!

May 2014,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/05/03/leading-up-to-love/,"May 2014, 03",Leading up to Love,"I was hoping I would win the Listserve at 25 when I have it all figured out. All the 25-year-olds are probably shaking their heads because they're waiting for 30 when they'll have it all figured out. Maybe we're all clueless. But maybe that's a good thing! Imagine a life so intricately planned out. Where's the fun in that?

I’m 23 years young and I have no sense of direction, whether it’s on the road or in life. I really don't care about being a legend or being remembered. I want to enjoy my life, do good, and be happy with the people I love. I live about 15 minutes away from Washington, D.C., working at a nonprofit where I couldn’t be happier. Part of the reason I think I'm so optimistic is because of my faith, Islam, and the whole whatever's-meant-to-happen-will-happen idea. I keep this in mind when I'm feeling down and you'd be surprised how quickly it shifts my perspective.

My family is a bit crazy, but it makes for interesting conversation. My mom is a red-headed white woman who grew up in DC, and my dad is a Pakistani brown man who came to the states in the 70's. I wear a hijab, or headscarf, and we as a family confuse and amuse people quite a bit…

Sometimes I even confuse myself. For the past year I’ve been jumping between wearing a traditionally-styled scarf and a stylish turban. Although I rock the turban, one of the main reasons I wear it is to avoid negative reactions from people who are a little less open-minded. It sucks because I don’t want to hide my religion, but I don’t want to be looked at as an outsider, either.

While I don't want to get into the implications of displaying my faith openly wherever I go, it's shaped who I am today. Some of it good, some of it I could do without. I'm overly-considerate. This may sound great, but I envy the people who do what they want regardless of what others might think. I'm very observant of others and I generally make decisions based off how I think others will react. I'm trying to slash stereotypes and change the face of Islam. It's what got me interested in filmmaking as a hobby.. the Muslim perspective is almost nonexistent. Sometimes I’m excited about the opportunity to represent Islam. Sometimes it’s too big of a responsibility to try and take on.

Ok, that's enough about me. Today I gave a ride home to my friend Michelle, who told me about how she met her husband and how deeply in love with him she still is. And the cool thing about it is that he's deeply in love with her too! She talked about something seemingly obvious, but often ignored... A relationship should have an equal amount of input. It can’t be one-sided. So make sure you're showering all the right people with your love.

Love is the most important thing in the world. Love the little things, like good food. Take it all in. Love yourself, love God if you can, love your family, love your partner. Make sure you're getting and giving a healthy dose of love.

S/o to my sister/bestfriend Samirah, my crazy brother Khalid, my friends Zaid and Sue Sue, who share my Listserve love, and Lina, who hopefully succeeded in helping me avoid looking like a fool with this email.

May 2014,02,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/05/02/air-force-dependent-daughter/,"May 2014, 02",Air Force Dependent Daughter,"I am 52 years old.  I have two awesome kids who currently serve in the Air Force.  Growing up as a dependent daughter of an AF officer, I lived in eight states.  I went to four grade schools in three states and three high schools in three different states.  I have been married and divorced twice and lived with two other men.

We hear a lot about spouses of military people, -the separation from the spouse,  -the hardship of money,  -bringing up kids alone.  But, what about the kids, the sons, the daughters?  How does growing up in a military home impact the rest of their lives?

After my last breakup, I went to a therapist.  What is wrong with me? Why can’t I stay happy in a relationship?  It didn’t take her long to say something to me that made me change the way I viewed ALL of my relationships -with men, women and family.

Moving so much all my life until I was 18 made it hard for me to learn how to establish long term relationship.  I was awesome at making friends.  I could talk to anyone.  But, I never learned to maintain those relationships for more than a few years.  As a result, it was easy for me to make new girlfriends or find a new boyfriend when things got tough.  I never learned how to cultivate a relationship that would endure difficult situations. I’d just say goodbye and move on.

Maybe in this current relationship, I am holding on to something that I shouldn’t…..

That turned out to be a little lonely.

On to a lighter subject….People used to talk about Colorado for the fantastic skiing, hiking, kayaking, camping, etc.  But now, we have legalized pot laws. Many people think this is all a huge embarrassment for Colorado.   The 4/20 pot holiday the once-underground celebration is now mainstream as the first state that legalized marijuana.  Tens of thousands of people participated.    One hundred and thirty citations were issued over the two day event.  Ninety-two for marijuana.  But, it hasn’t stopped people from illegally trying to sell it.  It isn’t supposed to be smoked publicly, but you can smell in on every street corner, coming out of peoples car windows.  New Jersey’s Governor said they would never legalize it for the money.   Our legislators are trying to figure out what to do with all the money the State is now making from increased tax revenue.  They say that tourism is booming! Colorado is a beautiful state.  I hope people don’t forget about our majestic mountains, almost perfect weather and the small town feel of the City of Denver.

I am prepared to leave my job, my city and my friends to live out the path constructed by The Listserve’s collected trail markers. By relinquishing control of my time I want to weave a string of experiences that will connect this group of minds in a way that might change more lives than just my own.

I will create and document this journey that brings The Listserve’s ideas to life. I have a couple months and a couple grand I’m willing to invest in this adventure. Keep this in mind when suggesting hot-air balloon piloting or hiking from Patagonia to Alaska. Otherwise, share the things that move your soul. I want to show how much life can be lived with very little.

In my travels I've been to the Maha Kumbh Mela in India and walked 7km to bathe in the Ganges with millions upon millions of other people. I've been held at gunpoint by government soldiers in Conakry. I've been in love in Borneo and lonely in Peru. Each of these experiences have shaped me into who I am today. My time traveling has been about doing what I want, and now I want to relinquish a portion of my volition to do what you want. Sculpt me.

You will own this time. Give me an experience I cannot find on Google. A destination not on a map. A lesson not in a book. Introduce people without Wikipedia bios. Go beyond the bucket list and send me to the core of the human experience. If it’s not illegal, harmful or going to give me the clap, I’ll do it and share the experience with you on my website. Remember, this all starts with an email from you. I’m waiting. Chop chop.

This is it. This is life. Let’s live it together.

Over four years I traveled to 32 countries as a videographer and documentor for a gonzo composer who calls himself Whatthe Animalssay. He writes, composes and records music from a mini studio packed in his bags. Each album he makes is the product of a particular place and time. Music is only released digitally to avoid using resources. I love not only his music but how he’s chosen to live his life and create his art. He lives his craft and is an endless source of inspiration to me. I hope you take the time to listen to his work on Bandcamp.

TLDR: Go fly!  I'm writing this at 36000 feet while Aeroflot A330 flies me to JFK from Moscow. This is my fourth flight to the US in the past 12 months. This week I will have my commercial and multiengine pilot check rides. This will be the end of a first step of becoming a professional pilot - something I wouldn't believe just 2 years ago.  They say money is the force that makes airplanes fly. But it also takes passion. And support from family.  Just over two years ago I was a 31-years old well-paid manager in the booming Russian Internet industry. I had a childish dream of flying, and I shared it with a woman I'd just started to date. But I had never made a single step towards my dream before. She wanted me to be happy so she gave me a present - a 30 minutes ride on a powerful soviet propeller-driven Yak-18T. And that was the beginning of a new me. I married this woman, we're expecting a baby in a month.  I became a private (amateur) pilot. Later I quit online industry and focused on flying, that was half a year ago. It took me quite some time to make this decision and then a nice amount of money to move that direction. I know that now for some years I won't be able to earn as much as I used to. But I love flying. Being a good pilot is all about studying, improving, learning, advancing. I hope that in a few years I will address my passengers as a captain, and my speech will be loud, clear, friendly and informative - that's what I've been always missing as a passenger.   If you haven't done so, call to the nearest general aviation airport and ask them how you can have an introductory flight with a local flight school or club. In Russia you can find a list at my hobby website, just google for ""avialog"".  Some principles I would like to share: - Avoid bad people in your life. It's better not to engage in any business with a moral bastard. Life can be much better if you focus on good people and, of course, on your family. - Family is important. It's so good when somebody's happy to see you back at home. Especially when you're a pilot. Also, people trust you more. - Better leave politics to politicians, don't let them brainwash you. Don't believe all the media reports about Crimea. If you're not there, don't judge. Be more skeptical and read more history. - You will be a solid person if you respect others and don't tolerate disrespect to you. - Impressions during travel must be shared. Travel the world, judge less, listen more. - Believe in science and human mind. We fly because of science, not prayers. - Flying makes you feel happy and alive. Go fly!   Quite a few readers of this email know me personally, so I'm sending Privet! (Hi in Russian) to them.  I hope I didn’t sound too much like captain obvious. Send me an email with any kinds of questions or thoughts.

My name's Kevin, and I write you from USS WAYNE E. MEYER, a US Navydestroyer currently just getting started on a lengthy deployment inthe Pacific. I'm new to the Navy- I showed up to the ship two daysbefore we deployed a month ago- so I don't have loads of sea stories,but I've figured a little bit out.

So what does the US Navy do on deployment? We spend a lot of timetraining- far more than I would have guessed prior to coming aboard.Damage control scenarios, man overboard scenarios, practice gunshoots, briefs, and constant, non-stop flights by the helos embarkedfor the length of the deployment- it makes for a pretty busy schedule!But we're out here to perform a variety of missions- to reassure ourallies of our commitment to the region, help keep the sea open forinternational trade, respond to any crises slash natural disastersthat might arise, and more- so we have lots of training to do to beprepared.

Anyway, as one of King Neptune's newest trusty shellbacks, I figured Iought to teach you a bit about the ways of the Order of Neptune. Yousee, when ships cross the Equator (as we did recently en route toTahiti), King Neptune, along with Davy Jones and the rest of his royalretinue, always drops by to ensure the crew is worthy to serve him ashonorable shellbacks. The specific steps of this process are notrightly sent out in an email to thousands of people, but it involvesthe slimy pollywogs (that's you) dressing up to entertain the crew'strusty shellbacks with song and dance. The next day the wogs are upearly to enjoy a special nautical breakfast, and then they must be""cleansed"" of their sliminess before their presentation to KingNeptune.

Charlie Darwin himself crossed the line aboard the HMS Beagle in hisjourneys south to do big science, and the ships' captain, RobertFitzRoy, shared in his journal a neat little rhyme describing theceremonies:

Deep was the bath, to wash away all ill;Notched was the razor—of bitter taste the pill.Most ruffianly the barber looked—his comb was trebly nailed—And water, dashed from every side, the neophyte assailed

Indeed! (As the rhyme suggests, crossing the line ceremonies havetraditionally involved some pretty serious hazing. Today's Navy doesthings differently of course, and it was interesting to see how thesanctioned events attempt to maintain the tradition while ensuringsafety and a lack of hazing.)

That's all I've got to share for now- if you have any of your own seastories, or questions about the Navy, or just want to say hello, shootme an email! And especially if you reside in San Diego- that's whereI'll be when the ship's not deployed, and I'm always up to meet newfriends. Especially if you speak Arabic.

A quick p.s.: if you are looking for a good charity, might I recommendthe Collateral Repair Project, an organization located in Amman,Jordan, that helps some of the country's many Syrian and Iraqirefugees by providing for basic needs like food and household goods.The number of refugees, particularly given the ongoing conflict inSyria, is really overwhelming, and it's a very worthy cause!

I coach high school softball in the spring, and that afternoon, Ky was beamed in the elbow by the fastest pitcher in our Regional. Getting hit really pissed her off, so she stole second and third base on the next two pitches. The fire in her eyes is one of my favorite coaching memories. Ky loved the sport. She worked hard, always asking me to hit a few extra fly balls at the end of practices in the summer. She was incredibly goofy, bringing infectious laughter to the whole team, and was loved dearly by everyone. On a sunnySunday afternoon, Kylie lost control of her vehicle. She wasn't speeding. She wasn't texting or talking on her cell phone. A millisecond sooner or later and she would have missed the tree that took her life. There isn't anything to blame or a cause to get behind that would have prevented her accident. There is no reasonable explanation why she isn't here today. She will be 17 forever.

When I was 17, I crawled into the hospital bed of an 8th grade boy. He'd been fighting cancer on and off since kindergarten, and during the last year of his life, we became friends. One of his nurses came in, and he squeezed my hand while she administered drugs into his IV. Keith had always told us it was okay to cry, and as a few tears slipped out with his pain, I handed him a tissue. We laughed about how the first time he had a girl in his bed, he was crying in front of her. Keith passed away two days later.

I'm not sending out invitations to my pity-party. I simply want to share with you the first two thoughts that run through my head when I hear someone complain about turning 30 (or 40 or 50 or 27). There have been so many young people in my life that won't be seeing 30, and I'm sure they would have loved to celebrate another birthday instead of the cruel fate they were dealt.

I'm 27, I've been married for two weeks and two days, and I have incredibly loving and supportive people in my life. I am not shy about telling them how much I love them and need them in my life. Take time today to shoot a text or an email or a call or a snap or a high five to someone you care about. Don't let your love go unsaid.

My three pieces of wisdom:1. Donate Blood. (If you say you don't want to do it because you don't like needles or it hurts, remind yourself of what the person on the other end is probably going through when they receive it. My guess is it's a lot worse than a needle prick.)2. Pick up litter. (I know you aren't the one who put it there, but you should be the one to pick it up.)3. Be kind.

I've followed the listserve my sophomore year of college after my boss at one of my internships told me about another listserve about cheap apartments in Manhattan, I accidentally subscribed to the wrong one (and wound up living in a 2 bedroom apartment in the middle of nowhere Brooklyn with 3 other people). Three years and hundreds of emails from strangers later I've finally been chosen. So stoked.

I don't have any life advice to give because I'm 22 and need more advice that I can give/ I find it somewhat annoying when people send out email blasts about how everyone needs to do *said thing* to reach *said results*.

I'm just going to tell you all what's going on in my life because it's currently a shitstorm and what better way of working through your problems than to email a bunch of strangers.

I graduate college in a few weeks and I'm panicking. I'm not panicking because I majored in something I love and I can't make any money with it (which I did, no regrets), I'm panicking because there are so many things that I want to do and places I want to go and according to my parents I have no direction.

I have to read Eugene Thacker's What is Biomedia and write a response that is due in 9 hours. I should be working on that instead of writing this email.

I found out I was pregnant in January, which is scary enough when you are 22, single, on the brink of starting real adulthood, and alone, but it was even worse when I found out it was ectopic. One of my closest friends told his aunt and he drunkenly told me that she was ""embarrassed for me because I couldn't even get pregnant right"". It might have been the meanest thing I've ever heard anyone say about me. We got in to a huge fight and stopped being friends.

After spending my entire college career single, I met a great guy 2 months before graduation. I realize that it's unrealistic for us to actually be in a relationship (even though we essentially are, idk, it's confusing), but I hope it works out with us. He's such a great guy and makes me unbelievably happy.

I'd never tell him that.

Better to Best by You Blew It! has been my jam since their latest album came out. If you are having a bad day you should listen to it.

Maybe it wouldn't hurt to try to be happy.Maybe things aren't quite as bad as I let myself believe.

Feel free to email me back and tell me how to become a functioning adult.

Ever had a ""Heart of Darkness"" moment? Where you find yourself peering down a very black tunnel, looking for a glimpse of light. But instead of light, you see your darkest self?

You know the one.  Though you won't want to admit it. Not even you, that gave birth to this creature, can bear to look at it. You've hidden it from even your closest, dearest, most intimate friend, lover, partner, self. The chill grabs your gut, freezes your brain, stops your heart.  You, at your worst, when nothing can stop you from destroying everything you've tried to create.

Method, reason, love, ideals... all cancers you must, this very moment, root out and obliterate.

You struggle to understand, but it's stronger than you. It doesn't matter how you approach this moment: THIS moment has no compassion, no logic, no morals. This is decay, entropy, nothing.  Christianity without resurrection, Islam without Allah, Buddhism without enlightment, you without any redeeming values.

No, it can't be! Life, love, technology, lol cats, the royal we... must always find a solution.

But, no. You're pissing your pants, you're swallowing hard and you're silently screaming for mercy from a merciless self.  There are no extenuating circumstances. No denying. It's all your responsibility and yours alone.

Another moment and you and your world will be infinitely sadder and poorer. You know it. Done or not done; you've allowed it to happen. 

You've shat your principles. Lost all sense of direction. It's a forced march. There's no turning back. No destination.

From this hellhole that is your new reality, what would YOU do?

My mother was super involved in extra-curriculars (PTA, Girl Scouts, etc) but we never volunteered as a family. I've always been internally motivated - I found Alternative Spring Break my freshman year at University of Illinois.  ASB is an organization that sends service learning trips for college students over academic breaks. The focus is more on education and changing the individuals on the trip than on service. I went on 7 trips in 5 years,  issues ranging from Hunger and Homelessness to Youth Literacy to Environmental Issues,  served on the planning board, and made friends that I can't imagine life without. I'm still involved in  by serving on the Board of Directors for Break Away, overseeing the national movement of service learning trips and building lifelong active citizens.

I get frustrated when so many smart brains spend their time building the next ""What's for Lunch"" Apps - so many people only see ""First World Problems"" and spend a ton of time, money, and smarts solving  non-problems. (That's not to say I won't pay $.99 for that Whats for Lunch app. A girl's gotta eat.)

After graduating with a degree in General Engineering and a minor in computer science, I went to work for Accenture. I spent most of college thinking I would join Teach For America; I felt like I was selling out when I joined. Post Accenture I served as as IT manager and eventually Interim VP of IT for the Ounce of Prevention Fund, a non profit focused on early childhood education in the US. It turns out the skills I picked up at Accenture working for ""the man"" are incredibly invaluable in the non-profit world - an industry that drastically needs data and technology help and smart brains to solve big problems.

I currently work at a startup called GiveForward - we are a crowdfunding platform for medical expenses. If you know anyone that has Medical related expenses (even pets! or travel related to medical procedures) check out GiveForward, start a fundraiser, and email me about it - we've raised over $90 million dollars for individuals in the US.

(Texas BBQ hard to pass up) Had a long suffering wife and a beautiful young daughter> my previous job was sitting in a chair 10 hours a day, helping others with computer issues. One night, after a big meal of brisket, I went to bed.My daughter, who was 8 at the time, came into our bed room a little scared of something and wanted to sleep in our bed. She had not done this in at least a year or so.I got up, let her slide in between my wife and I and, at this point I noticed my arm hurt, like I had slept on it funny. I decided to go downstairs for an advil, and by the time I had got downstairs, I was sweating and my fingers were going numb. I went back upstairs and google these two things. webMD only said ""CALL 911"" which I didI woke my wife, told her and she got up and started getting things together. At this time my chest hurt, my neck hurt, my hands and fingers were numb. The 911 operator had told me to chew up some aspirin, which i had done. My chest REALLY hurt now, exactly like they describe it. An elephant sitting on it. A big one.The EMS paramedics got there in 5 minutes. They put me on a gurney and got me to the hospital in 8 more minutes. They rushed me in, had a doctor there waiting, xrayed me determined I had blockage in ""the widowmaker"" Left anterior Descending. The artery that feeds blood to the heart. He stented me, I was wheeled into the recovery. felt great. Next thing I knew, i was woken up by about 300 joules of electricity. This happened about 8 more times. Not fun, extremely painful. They finally got another stent into me and got my heart started again.It seems that the first stent had collapsed and caused complete blockage of my LAD, essentially killing me, Not fun. But after 4 days in CICU I walked out.Really happy to be alive. My wife and I dropped meat and dairy and eggs from our diet, I lost 50 pounds, in 2 years got a great result on all my labs and stress test.I had known I had high blood pressure and high cholesterol, but did nothing about it. I did not drink, smoke, use any drugs of any kind except for advil. I am lucky to be alive, but now feel a little like i'm not so indestructible as I did before, and I worry sometimes I will not wake up when I go to bed. I hope that feeling goes away.

Feel free to email me about anything, I would love to hear from any of you!

For if ‘Thou mayest’—it is also true that ‘Thou mayest not.’ Don’t you see?...‘Thou mayest’!

It is easy out of laziness, out of weakness, to throw oneself into the lap of deity, saying, ‘I couldn’t help it; the way was set.’ But think of the glory of the choice! That makes a man a man. A cat has no choice, a bee must make honey. There’s no godliness there...Confucius tells men how they should live to have good and successful lives. But this—this is a ladder to climb to the stars.” Lee’s eyes shone. “You can never lose that. It cuts the feet from under weakness and cowardliness and laziness...I have no bent toward gods.

April 2014,17,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/04/17/waves/,"April 2014, 17",Waves,"Recently I almost died. My esophagus tore open when I was cycling the Alpine Dam/Seven Sisters loop, just north of San Francisco.

My chest blew up like a balloon. I went to the hospital that evening. They said I had about a 60% shot at making it more than a day or two.

I was alone in the hospital all night. My extended family lives far away, and my wife couldn't leave work.

That night I realized I'd never confronted what it meant to die.

I'm a young guy, early 30s. At an intellectual level I know I won't live forever. And out of vanity and ego, I've always told myself that I'll die without fear and without regrets.

It turns out that looming death makes that kind of knowledge cold comfort, and reveals the flimsiness of those self-perceptions. I was afraid I'd die alone and I regretted that I hadn't done more with my life.

And most of all, I realized I didn't know how to die well. If I had gone that night, I would have gone out gasping and terrified, not with grace, love, and simplicity. 

In the end I lived (clearly!). But the question remained: how does one confront death honestly?  

Here's the best answer I've found so far. Apologies to Thich Nhat Hanh, for so roughly approximating his thoughts on the matter. Here goes.

The ocean is full of waves that go up and go down. Some are towering and immensely powerful, others small and gentle. They start far out at sea, and then they crash on the beach and are gone. At the same time, a wave is the water. And the water is the wave. You can't separate the two. When the wave crashes, it becomes water again...which it always was.

The beginning and end of a wave are like a person’s birth and death. We are ourselves, and we are also made up of everything else: other people, the earth, plants, sun, the sky, and all the elements. We are and have always been inseparable. And we begin, and ultimately, we die. And when we die we become what we have always been: everything else.

And while we celebrate the birth of a wave (so exciting to see one coming!), we don't mourn its death. Because we know that wave is the water, and the water still lives, and will live for longer than we can imagine.  

We're like the waves. We’re born and we die, and at the same time we're not born and we don't die.

That’s it. Reach out anytime! Always happy to meet fellow ""waves"" on this trip across the ocean. Especially if those waves like road biking, craft beer, and video games. :)

But well, speaking of odds, The incredibly low odds that a complex interaction of different chemical substances produced on the death of different stars would give rise to a conscious living organism who is currently writing an email to other fellow living organisms living on a tiny little rock orbiting a medium-sized star in a galaxy that contains between 100 and 400 billion stars make the 1.14 in 10 million figure just a cake-walk, so I'm probably not as lucky as I previously thought; Thanks Science for giving us the ability to accurately asses probabilities and for proving I'm not especially lucky at all..

Speaking of Science, I think that the solution to most human problems will come through technological advancements and science; They have given us tools that have dramatically revolutionized our lives for the better, nevertheless, I think that all the recent and not-so-recent technological advancements are just the icing on the cake, from the Steam Engine to the Internet, we're just beginning to recognize how much technology and science can change our lives.

If you liked the last part, you'll sure like Michio Kaku's recent books (Physics of the Future and The Future of the Mind); If you are unhappy or feeling depressed, you should read The Enchiridion by Epictetus and The Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, both are books about the paradoxical achievement of happiness through accepting that negative phenomena may affect your life; I've lost a sizable amount of weight just by watching the total amount of calories I eat, I'm living testimony to the fact that you can lose weight while eating chocolate and ice cream every single day, if you're interested, read up The Hacker's Diet by John Walker, it is available completely free-of-charge online and the information it provided has changed my life.

For fear is a great weapon. When you are afraid of your fellow passenger and suspect of your neighbor, that is when the terrorist has won. For he has turned society on itself.

A terrorized society is not only decapacitated, but also vulnerable,  simply because scared people are easy to manipulate. You will notice that, as a side-effect, power-hungry people will use your fear to gain power. What was once a real threat is now a perpetual bogeyman used to limit your freedom and further sustain your fear.

So how do you fight terrorism? With strength. With cooperation. With self-confidence. With reliance in numbers. The terrorist does not have enough power to cause substantial damage. He can perform acts designed to induce fear,  but in reality the probability of getting hurt is extremely small. Believe in that. Secondly: stick together. Don't let fear make you introvert. Talk to your fellow passenger and neighbor. Get to know them. This way, we can make it harder for the terrorist to blend in and simultaneously keep morale up together. Lastly, don't feed the power trolls. Don't give up your freedom for a false sense of security. False security is the business of the mafia, not the government. 

Instead give directed power to well-established institutions. Give crime-fighting organizations like the police an appropriate budget for investigating terror-related crime, along with powerful tools to use on suspects. But only when there is reasonable suspicion. This is the only method which has been proven effective in catching terrorists, contrary to what some propaganda would like you to believe. Don't approve of blanket searches. Don't accept ""generous"" interpretations of your constitution. Don't give the government power to read your mail, e-mail and social network posts. Or to film you on every street corner. Don't relinquish power to organizations which answers to no-one but themselves. Please think about what these systems will degenerate into.

Let us not buy into the war-inspired territorial thinking as a mechanism of security. Isolationism is dangerous. Just look at the nationalism and isolationism prior to the world wars. Do we really want to revert the globalization which the last decades of information sharing has brought about? 

Please fight this threat while maintaining integrity. This is a fight for our right to keep our democratic principles. So let's not abandon them in the heat of the moment. For if we do, we are playing right into the hands of the terrorist.

My grandfather was his own boss, he was a lawyer and managed a bunch of real estate. He was always hustling, even in his late 70s, 80s and didn't really retire. I met a family friend many years ago who told me that my grandfather was the hardest working man he knew. My father is a retired doctor who has been very innovative and creative in his practice. He is well respected around the world by his peers and his patients loved him. He continues to do research, further innovating and pursuing medical discoveries for everyone's benefit. Both my father and grandfather were very hardworking and their work was a big part of their identity.

I've started two companies, one we sold about 10 years ago. I was part of the founding team of another startup before that. I've been in the tech, startup world since the first dot com wave and can't imagine doing anything else or wanting to do anything else.

My current company, Flowboard, is in the process of breaking through and disrupting a huge industry. My and my team's motivation isn't the payday, although that is a welcome outcome.

Our drive is to innovate, make a dent, alter history, create positive change, empower voices and make effective presentations and good storytelling easy and accessible to everyone.

Anyone can have their own entrepreneur journey and I encourage it. But. You need to have a passion for an idea or a product, a belief in yourself and the team you build, and the acceptance that it might fail.  You are going to work harder with more sustained and dedicated time and energy than your friends and family who aren't entrepreneurs. They might not understand or relate to you, your journey or mission. Starting a company is not for the faint of heart, but can be so rewarding on so many levels.

Thanks for reading my perspective and please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you on your entrepreneur journey, if you choose to accept the mission.

You don't even have a name yet, but someday when you learn how to google, you might find this instead of a trove of facebook photos cataloging your life which your father and I won't be posting. You're just about 9 weeks away from your debut in this world. The experience of carrying you these past 30 weeks has given me such an appreciation for the herculean effort that is creating a human life. As a second born, I'm in awe that my mother knew exactly what she was getting into and still wanted to do it again for me. That gift is something I think about paying forward to you every day that you're in there, growing and preparing for your first gulp of air. I realize of course that getting you here is just the beginning. Your dad and I will spend the rest of our lives doing everything we can to ensure your happiness and safety. Our hopes for you are vast but also simple: to be kind, to be curious, to be thoughtful. We are the product of many generations of our ancestors, whose efforts led to every little thing that fell into place to bring us here and to find each other. We plan to instill all of that in you (including but obviously not limited to: an appreciation for a good burrito and genuine Texas barbecue, a love of the beach and the mountains, a desire to travel and an enjoyment of books).

Please know that you have been loved long before you created the chemical reaction that caused two blue lines on a pregnancy test. I hope this knowledge sustains you on the days that you find this world to be a gritty, tiresome and brutal place. I can't protect you forever from all of that but I can share everything good this world has to offer with you. So rest up, little one, there is so much in store for you!

Love,Mom

Dear Listservers,

It might seem an odd choice to write this letter to a listserve of thousands of people scattered across the globe but in some way, it feels right to send it out into the universe. To those of you who are parents, I hope to be worthy of your courageous ranks. To those who are not, I hope you pause to consider all that it took to give you your shot.

April 2014,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/04/09/being-alright/,"April 2014, 09",Being alright,"I sat at the table with a coffee gone lukewarm, gazing at the barista’s swirl. He’s drawing a pair of lines on the table with an imaginary pen.“Unless we are identical people, Clarice, it’s two lines. The way we envision our lives – our preferences, our principles, our outlook – end up being two different lines.”He’s visibly worried. It has been this way since we argued.“And as a couple, sometimes we’re on my line and sometimes we’re on your line. You see, that’s what love is, the willingness to be on the other’s line. Sometimes that switch can be sold to one. I do my best to explain the whys don’t I?”He’s always telling me that. Unless it’s a matter of preference, explain the whys. “..but sometimes it’s just preference. And it’s at those times that switching over reassures the other that there is love. Love’s what gets you through that. But the discomfort of switching over adds up, you know? Fairness is another aspect of this. Very mathematically speaking, to be happy in the long term, we have to make sure it’s even, the sacrifices.” Mathematically speaking? Han is always putting things into little buckets of logic. Just hug me goddammit. This’ll stop that moment.“Sometimes you change for me, and sometimes I learn to expect less. And the other way around”I am still quiet. His hair’s disheveled and he’s trying so hard to mend things, in his own way. He will not learn that this fairness he speaks of, if he earns by asking for it, will not seem as sweet. Just trust me, Han. Look at life many years from now and you’ll see that things were fair. I understand what you’re saying, and I am committed to the same thing. You having to say it is the shame. Time will go by, and one thing we know for certain today is that no matter how close we are, and how precise our life, one of us will die first. And leave the other with the burden of this measurement. Look then, Han, without loss shading that measurement ivory, or coating away its blemishes, and you’ll find your fairness. We just have to make it through today, honey. Today is what we have together. Just hold me, I am tired.He reaches out and takes my hand still looking thoughtful, “I know you know all this. I should be quiet.”“No, you’re right. I couldn’t have phrased it as well, but I think we want the same things and I am going to pay more attention”, I reply. My hand is on top of his now and we sit that way for a few more minutes. As I pull back to get up I say, “I am going to heat this coffee up and head back, feel better ok? We’re going to be alright.”

April 2014,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/04/08/about-today/,"April 2014, 08",About today,"Hello, beautiful Listservians! I must say, you're looking great today.

I am sitting here on my end of this giant e-megaphone with a jar of peanut butter and a spoon (fellow pb lovers, you know this never ends well) in a state of semi-disbelief. Honestly, I never thought my turn would come and yet here it is, staring back at me in a blank email of endless possibilities. We've all thought about it - what would you say to the rest of the world in 600 short words? Well, I finally know what I want to talk about, I think on some level I knew all along.

I want to talk about you guys. And Einstein.

Once a day for almost two years, you've filled my inbox with something new. A story from a far away land, a learned lesson, a favorite recipe, a new book or music suggestion, some words of wisdom, some insight to vocations, hobbies, and passions, or just a simple hello. I'm even lucky enough to have received one (and you did, too) from my beautiful sister Riley. She introduced me to the Listserve and let me tell you, she is awesome. Anyways, you're a well-versed bunch, people of the world! And I've learned so much from all of you.

I'm imagining you at this very moment - all 25,000+ in one fictional composite being. You're anywhere and everywhere, on a crowded bus on your way work, scrolling through emails at your cubicle desk, escaping for a break on an awkward first date, sitting at an internet café on a tropical island in the south pacific, catching the first (or last) rays of sun shining through your bedroom window. The day is just beginning. Or maybe it's almost over. Maybe something has made today great, or not so great, sad, exciting, frustrating, just plain weird, or rather normal.  Maybe today's your birthday... happy birthday!

And here's where Einstein comes in.

Entanglement is a word that physicists use to describe the phenomenon of how interacting particles maintain a connectedness with each other no matter how far apart they are. Einstein called it ""spooky action at a distance"" and it has yet to be explained by any theory.  One, however, suggests that all particles on earth were once compacted together and, as a consequence, maintain a certain connectedness for eternity. Their common history makes them forever intwined.

For me, the Listserve has become a daily reminder of our own entanglement. Our days are filled with a million different things that set us apart from each other: goals we've set, things we're anxious about, events we anticipate, regrets, successes, interactions, challenges, and ofcourse the future, the big unknown. Regardless of everything, each minute of today will pass at the same pace for all of us. We're all here, owning today one moment at a time and doing it the best way we know how. It's pretty neat think of all us as somehow connected by this commonality of time, all together in one big messy network of entangled particles.

So, to you I say: Thank you for being you. Thank you or occupying your own unique little space on this earth and for filling your days with your passions, dreams, experiences, values, beliefs, insecurities, successes, failures, and great stories. Thank you for sharing them with me, I am proud to be a part of this. Keep asking questions, seeking challenges, smiling, and reminding everyone you love how much they mean to you.

Today is a new day. Don't worry, everything is going to be alright.

I'd love to hear from all of you! Tell me a story, let me know what's made your today special.

PS - Listen to ""About Today"" by the National. Or really, any song they've ever made... it's pure greatness.

Yes. My favorite art form, above movies, tv, books, music, paintings, and cat gifs is podcasts. That’s not to say that I don’t love all those other things (especially cat gifs) but my podcast obsession trumps all. And I like to think I know a good bit about podcasts, since I listen regularly to 45 of them. Which is too many. Like, seriously too many. I have to listen to most of them on 1.5 or 2x speed, and even then I end up with a huge backlog of episodes.Eventually I go through a purge where I just delete some old episodes and move on. There’s probably something poetic about that. Someone could probably make that a metaphor for an aspect of life.

 Whatever. Anyway, here are my top ten favorite podcasts: 10) Pop My Culture: Improvisers Cole Stratton and Vanessa Ragland talk about the week’s happenings in pop culture with a celebrity guest. It’s fun, it’s silly, and it’s always a blast. 9) The Mental Illness Happy Hour: Comedian Paul Gilmartin talks to guests of all kinds, from comedians to listeners to therapists, about mental health. The show is amazingly touching and has truly some of the best, most honest and open interviews I’ve ever heard. 8) How Did This Get Made? Comedians Paul Scheer, June Diane Rapheal, and Jason Mantzoukas, along with another guest, all watch a terrible movie and spend an hour breaking it down. 7) Scriptnotes: Screenwriters John August and Craig Mazin spend an hour every week talking in-depth about various aspects of screenwriting. 6) Doug Loves Movies: Comedian (noticing a theme?) Doug Benson runs a live movie-themed game show, featuring a rotating panel of awesomely funny comedians, actors, and the occasional musician. 5) The Indoor Kids: Comedian (it’s gonna keep going on like this…) Kumail Nanjiani and his wife Emily Gordon host the best video game podcast. I don’t even really play video games and I still love the show. 4) You Made It Weird: Comedian (I really like comedy. Deal.) Pete Holmes does crazy-long, crazy-in-depth interviews with one guest per week (usually a comedian.) They talk about the big stuff. 3) The Nerdist: Hosted by uber-nerd Christ Hardwick, it’s got excellent interviews with all kinds of great personalities, and has a really fun, enthusiastic, and friendly vibe. 2) Welcome To Night Vale: No description would do it justice, just listen and hear for yourself. All I will say is that it is beyond incredible. And stay out of the Dog Park. 1) Harmontown: Consistently the funniest 2 hours of my week. Community creator Dan Harmon and his friends do a goofy, off the rails, town-hall-esque live show every week that features rapping, ranting, and Dungeons & Dragons. It’s the best. Some others that I recommend checking out: Alison Rosen Is Your New Best Friend, The Nerdist Writers Panel, Before You Were Funny, FeaB, Jonah Raydio, Who Charted, The Big Pull, James Bonding, and The Alton Browncast. If you have podcasts to recommend, or just want to say hi (or have an internship to give a college computer science sophomore interested in writing and producing for film/tv/internet/radio…) email me, or hit me up on twitter (@AndrewTheWhip) And if you like music and vlogs, check me on the YouTubes (TheAndrewWhipple) and, much more importantly, check my ridiculously talented friends Hannah Moroz and Kirstyn Hippe. (Meow.)

April 2014,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/04/05/pass-me-a-beer/,"April 2014, 05",Pass Me a Beer!,"We're living in a renaissance.

While that could be true for many reasons, the specific reason I'm going to dive into today is beer. Yes, we're living in a beer renaissance, my friends; especially in the US.

For too long, when we talk about beer, the iconic fizzy water beverage comes to mind. My father, rest his soul, was a Pabst Blue Ribbon man. It's all he knew. While those big-name beers serve their purpose, there is a growing market of truly delicious beers sprouting out between the cracks. Now more than ever, consumers are discovering that the word ""beer"" means more than just a weak lager made by a company with a huge marketing budget. According to Beverage Industry magazine, the top craft beers enjoyed a 19.4% increase in sales last year. Society is branching out, and discovering the wonder of robust porters, citrusy bitter IPAs, sweet Belgians, cloudy refreshing wheats, and malty warm ambers.

With this market shift, people are rediscovering the lost concept of supporting small, local businesses. It's a great thing when the consumer can sit down at their local brewery and have a beer with the owner; someone on their level, just trying to make an excellent product. Suddenly, buying beer gives you a sense of contributing to your community; like you're making a difference.

I'm proud to live in Michigan, where we take our craft beer seriously. Grand Rapids, MI was 2013's ""Beer City, USA"" in a poll created by renowned beer columnist Charlie Papazian. Beer festivals all across the state are consistently selling out, bringing hoards of people who want to try all the latest and greatest brews. We have the big names like Bell's, Founders, and Short's... but the newer little guys are getting recognition too. It's not unheard of to drive an hour to check out the newest brewery opening up. 

Now, you might be saying, ""Gary, I don't like that fancy pants craft beer; it's too strong"". I hear you. I was like you. I hated all beer at first, and when I finally grew to accept it, it was the standard ""Light"" selection. The first craft beer that I ever liked was Bell's Oberon summer wheat, which coincidentally was just released for the season this week. My advice for you would be to just dive in and start trying new beers. Go to your local brewery and order a ""flight"", a.k.a. a sampler tray. They'll give you a bunch of beers to try, and then you can start figuring out what you like. You might be surprised!

The other side of this coin is home brewing. Most people imagine that making beer is very difficult, but that's not really true. Beer, at its core, is four ingredients: water, malted barley (malt), hops, and yeast. That's it! Obviously the amounts and types of each of those things vary, and you can always add in more ingredients (ever had a beer made with baby formula? I have. It wasn't that great). If you're interested, find your nearest home brew shop and talk to them; they will get you started. Alternatively, there are some great online brewing stores.

That's all. I'll leave you with something unrelated to beer.

April 2014,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/04/04/story-time/,"April 2014, 04",Story Time,"Sadly, I don’t have any advice for anyone. Despite my early-20s narcissism I really don’t feel like there’s anything I could say here that you haven’t heard already in the form of quotes typed over Instagram-filtered photos and posted every day by your aunt-in-law on her Facebook wall.

What I do have are stories. What I do have is a love of them; that’s why I’m here reading yours, after all.

I’m single. I started dating and discovered something even more fascinating: I love first dates. It’s one of the few times you get to meet a stranger one on one and go for coffee or drinks and just tell each other all of your best stories.  Where else, really, does this sort of setup happen?

Frankly, the dates themselves as romantic ventures didn't pan out, so I changed course and branched from the goal of finding someone into the goal of finding as many stories as I could. I started going on “dates” with everyone – friends, family, guys, gals, complete strangers. You know those people who you’re friends with, but only in that sense of ‘you knew them in highschool and they moved into your city a few years back but you haven’t actually seen them since then’ – those, I've found, are some of the best people. Not complete strangers - you have a reason to catch up with them - but also gone just long enough for all the stories to be cool and new to you. And, as a bonus, you usually end up as actual friends again. Good deal!

Even before I discovered this I would always be approached on the train by random homeless people. I have no idea why, but it’s nearly guaranteed: I’m like a strange conversation magnet. Before it was kind of weird and creepy, and you’d do your best to shut it down and shrug it off – now I try my best to truly engage that forthcoming honesty. Some of them are straight up crazy, I’ll admit, but if my times volunteering in soup kitchens have taught me anything, it’s that homeless people see some of the coolest things merely by being out in public and being understated, always silently watching.

This, incidentally, became one of my new tenets: get out more. You can’t see the world by lounging around at home.  Pretend your city is somewhere completely new. Get lost. Talk to people.

I lied, I guess. Maybe that is advice.

If you’re in the Calgary area and want to go for coffee, let me know. If you’re in the Earth area and have a story either real or imagined, my email is below and I’d love to hear from you.

Stay awesome.

Backronyms:A backronym is a ""reverse acronym,"" formed from an existing word or name. Examples include APGAR (a series of tests used to determine the health of newborn babies, named after the physician who developed it) and the USA PATRIOT Act (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001).

Also of linguistic note: facetious and abstemious contain all of the vowels in alphabetical order.

Alison Jolly, primatologist:I get the New York Times morning digest. Anecdotally, the NYT features a lot more dead men than women, so it’s something to get excited about when there are multiple women eulogized. I learned about Alison Jolly in February.

In short, Alison Jolly was a primatologist who focused on lemurs. She helped refute the theory that males are dominant in all primate species, including humans, a fundamental part of evolutionary biology at the time. Through her studies of the ring-tailed lemur, she presented an example of female leadership in primates, which at the time went against the accepted scientific canon. She had a new species of mouse lemur named in her honor in 2006.

Ghost ships and the Lyubov Orlova:With the disappearance of the Malaysian Airlines flight, there has been a lot of uproar over the fact that in this hyperconnected day and age, we can lose something so large. However, there are “ghost ships,” adrift in the ocean. For example, the former cruise ship Lyubov Orlova was drifting in international waters for most of 2013. A 730ft ship, it was more than three times the length of a Boeing 777. It hit headlines with rumors that it was drifting towards the UK with cannibal rats aboard, but it is now believed to have sunk off the coast of Ireland (though still in international waters). What are you curious about? What is something that you were enthused that you learned about lately? What do you read to find interesting articles? Drop me a line – I’d love to hear about it.

Thanks to Morgan for introducing me to the Listserve!

Fun fact:  The odds of someone winning the Listserve lottery in their first year of joining (if they joined today) are about 1.45%. The odds of winning it within 5 years of joining? About 7.04%Note:  I make a few assumptions with these estimations.1. If you win once, you can win again2. The approximate 25,000 Listservians remains constant

If each person is eliminated from the lottery once he/she wins, your chances don’t increase by much (fractions of a percent). And I would guess there’s some sort of slow exponential increase of Listservians over time. In other words, your odds of winning are pretty low and only decreasing.

On math:

I’m currently a math tutor. When someone says “I’m not good at math” I always tell them that some people are just more naturally skilled at certain things (like math). For those who are not as skilled, you have to work hard at it. Saying “I’m not good at (some skill)” to me means “I haven’t given this particular skill my very best effort.”  I always tell my students that because they have to work harder, it means they’ll gain a deeper appreciation of that subject or skill.Above was a general statement, not a catch-all for every single skill. I’m a tutor, not a life coach! Haha.

On organization:You can organize just about every aspect of your life, so why not try organizing the time in your life? Try breaking your day / week down into a few different categories:

- Personal health and hygiene (e.g. sleeping, showering, eating, and exercising)- Work (or school)- Fostering social relationships (e.g. talking with friends and family, picking up chocolate for a friend, seeing friends)- Errands / Life Maintenance (e.g. groceries, plumbing issues, paying bills)- Self-Improvement (e.g. learning a foreign language, practicing a musical instrument, listening to an informative podcast, reading, exercising)- Me time (e.g. watching your favorite TV show, taking time to decompress, enjoying some peace and quiet)- BoguS (aka BS) time (watching an excess of TV, playing video games for hours, mindlessly wandering the Internet)

These categories can change from person to person (especially parents) but you can fit almost all your activities into one or more categories. Work and personal health take up a large portion of each day and week, so it’s important to cut down on the BS time and try to find time for Self-improvement and Fostering social relationships on a daily and weekly basis.One activity can fit into multiple categories.Also note that activities like your commute to work can be productive. I read on the train or listen to fun and educational podcasts so it can be counted as both “Work” and “Self-Improvement.”

Finally, “me time” is necessary for most people on a daily basis. Just make sure that your “me time” doesn’t turn into BS time.

On my favorite newsletters:If you like the Listserve, consider trying some weekdaily newsletters:  “Now I Know” by Dan Lewis and “Next Draft” by Dave Pell.Now I Know is a “free daily email newsletter of interesting things, you'll learn something new every day.” Dan Lewis has perfected the “fun fact of the day.”Next Draft is essentially your 5’o’clock news and morning newspaper in an email, except there’s no commercials and you get to read what you find most interesting. Dave Pell always has witty headlines.

Take care of yourself,

April 2014,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/04/01/fast-friendships/,"April 2014, 01",Fast Friendships,"Over the course of my life, I have had a handful of deep friendships that came suddenly and surprisingly and without any warning.  They have been with people of different nationalities, ages, and backgrounds.  Three are with men, and two with women.  In each case, I was meeting with someone for the first time, usually for accidental or inconsequential reasons, sometimes standing in for a colleague.  Each meeting I expected to be short and businesslike but each morphed quickly instead into a deep conversation between the two of us.  Bertrand Russell described a similar experience in his first meeting with Joseph Conrad:

""At our very first meeting, we talked with continually increasing intimacy. We seemed to sink through layer after layer of what was superficial, till gradually both reached the central fire. It was an experience unlike any other that I have known. We looked into each other's eyes half appalled and half intoxicated to find ourselves together in such a region. The emotion was as intense as passionate love, and at the same time all-embracing. I came away bewildered, and hardly able to find my way among ordinary affairs."" (""Autobiography."" Routledge, 2009.)

The writer George Fowler in his book ""Dance of a Fallen Monk"" describes a similar first meeting.  The intimate friendship between Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lu Carr also developed quickly like this.

It is odd that so much has been written about love, yet so little about friendship - friendship seems to be the elephant in the room.  And the few philosophers of friendship - Aristotle, Andrew Sullivan, AC Grayling - seem to believe that friends can only be made slowly.  Andrew Sullivan, for example, says that unlike falling in love, it is impossible to ""fall in friendship"", a statement that is spectacularly false.

I feel the only way to adequately describe these encounters is from mythology:  It was as if we were struck by an arrow fired by Cupid, the Roman god of attraction, or had magic dust sprinkled on us by forest sprites as happens in Shakespeare.  But in none of my encounters was there anything sexual or erotic; indeed, none of these friends have the physical qualities that attract me, starting with the fact that three of them are the wrong gender.  Rather, our encounters were meetings of minds, as if I was making contact with a long-lost twin brother or sister - someone who thinks very much like I do, but who knows different things, or has had different experiences.  Since I long ago realized I think very differently to most everyone about most everything, to find even one person who thinks like me is astonishing.  To find several is just awesome.  These friends are my life's doppelgangers, my alter egos.

In every case, the experience was profoundly moving, and we developed into long-term friends. One person has sadly passed on.  These friendships have led me to change my views on life significantly, as well as my jobs, and even my career.  Their influence on me bring to mind the Zen saying:  When the disciple is ready, the guru will appear.

One friend describes us as being virtual siblings, since we know each other as well as close brothers or sisters do, and we support each other loyally and without hesitation, through tragedy and triumph, as if we are family.  My life is so much richer for these experiences that began in accidental meetings, that it is hard not to imagine they were shaped by some divinity, rough-hewn by us and all.

Muchas gracias, amigos.

The last spectacular bastard flare-up coincided with my thesis at the UCLA directing program.  My ego had been wounded by countless film festival rejections and the looming possibility that others might be right about my lack of genius and/or general specialness.  I was terrified at the potential of returning to real life wielding only an MFA and a hundred grand in debt. Inspired by every art-as-life-cliché, I threw myself into a series of web videos which at the time seemed like the purest expression of my creative self.

On-screen, there were Civil War re-enactments, self-help gurus and grainy, romantic Super 8 music videos.  Behind the camera: fraudulent credit card applications, a string of bad behavior (mine) that lead to a sad and nasty breakup, and a google-analytics fueled vanity of pageviews, comments and press hits. In the end, the result was a series of very disposable webisodes.

Now I was sitting at a desk at MTV in the loneliest time of my life.  I was working in a digital department in a job I’d been lucky enough to get a month before graduation.  It was a rare good thing in an otherwise bad spell.  My grandmother - like a parent to me - had recently died.  My father had cancer.  When I wasn’t working, I was alone in my apartment waiting for an unlikely phone call from my ex forgiving my bad behavior and taking me back.

The best days were the ones that were packed with conference calls and tech meetings, and if I was lucky - a meeting with the jackass guys - a circus of cattle-prods, chaos, and punches to the balls that could distract anyone from anything, really.

This particular day was just an okay day. Lots of tech calls.  Lots of emails to respond to.  It felt good to be busy.  In the minute between two hour-long meetings, I got a call from an old friend - a friend from high school.

This friend and I had drifted apart in a previous stretch of my bastard behavior (also filmmaker-ambition related), but we had recently reconnected. His mother had died just over a week ago, and when it happened, I jumped on a plane back home to Houston to see him.  It felt good to be there for someone.  It felt good not to be the sociopathic me of six months ago, but the kind, useful, “new” me.

We reconnected.  At the reception after the memorial we drank too many beers and each time I tried to excuse myself from what felt like a family-only event, he’d pulled me back and pleaded with me to stay.  Finally, I stumbled away from the house to do a “mission critical” conference call about jackass and social media, hoping that no one on the line noticed me slurring.  I told my friend I’d come back soon.  I told him to come see me in LA. The friendship had been repaired.

So, when his call came - although I was still finishing an email, I picked up. I was only half-listening. “Hey, man - how’s it going?” he asked.  “Good, good.” I said.  “How’s your family?” he asked, “How’s your mom?”  Half-listening, I kept typing.  “Good, good, man.  How’s your mom?”

“Well, David,” he said, “my mom’s dead.”

Don't be afraid; let me explain.Every day, I record at least one sound from my environment. Today it was a hollow floor board that stuttered like a faulty trumpet, yesterday was a jackhammer on the sidewalk, and a couple of weeks ago: a howler monkey asserting his territory. My idea is to collect these sounds once a day for 10 years. As of this week, I will have successfully completed one and a half years.

My intention is to sculpt the sounds into pieces of music. Sometimes I find the inherent shape of a recording and preserve it - for example, a squeaking ceiling fan might produce such an outrageously complex tone that I will map it to a keyboard and play it unaffected - while sometimes I might change the character of a sound into something completely unrecognizable. I have found that by forcing myself into this simple routine, my ears are more aware than they ever have been. Also, the pieces of music that I make are now imbued with specific geographical and temporal meaning. The song that I am currently writing would not be the same without the howler monkey.

Now for our collaboration - Please send me a sound from your world. It could be a voice memo on your phone; pristine audio quality is not the point. It could be the birds outside your window (for those of you living outside NYC), or your coffee grinder. Short and sweet (under one minute) will be ideal. I will make a piece of music utilizing all of the Listserve sounds that I receive and dedicate it to you. For proof of my work, you may refer to the blog that shares the name of my email address: Sampling Is Sexy.

In lieu of an inspirational quote, I will close with this: 

Help kids make music. Everyone has something to learn from the awareness that young people bring to creating art. Whether practicing traditional instruments or using recording technology to manipulate sounds in the manner mentioned above, it is incredibly important that children be offered the opportunity to listen and make sounds of their own. Developing the discipline to listen closely to the world and then respond to it is an invaluable use of attention.

Thank you for reading.

Alas, PayPal has not kept up with Firefox, and Canada Post has delegated postage to PayPal instead of integrating their own online postage system ☹

So why 1st sale? I am moving. Having spent the last 2 years in a shared household, the guy on the lease is fed up with my occupation of the house. While everyone else keeps mostly to their rooms with occasional forays to the kitchen, I live in the living room(I’m retired), where I have my laptop, or the basement where I have set up a 3D projector. So my landlord wants me out in order to reoccupy the house before his parents come for an extended visit.

I’ve preferred shared households since the 60’s when I lived on Alberni Street in Vancouver – up to 38 communards in a 3-bedroom house. We exported people to Galiano Island to make room. I eventually left to attend Ryerson in Photo Arts, but got entranced by computers and an interactive language called APL. Check out the programming, in a dozen characters or so, of Conway’s The Game of Life on YouTube. Then a degree in Computer Science at York University and work as a programmer, systems analyst, and systems designer at Sears, Canadian Tire, Bell, BNR, and consulting work around Ottawa.

Back to revisiting my childhood. I have been going through my dad’s science fiction collection and putting his old Tarzan, Barsoom and other books up for sale (Abacurial is my eBay cognomen). Among these are a fairly complete set of Astounding magazines from the 30’s to the 60’s – and there are boxes and boxes. Dad lived pre-internet. Now to try to sell them through the thicket of rules and limits eBay has placed to protect buyers.

I was into microcomputers since I got a TRS-80 I took to Saudi Arabia with me and programmed a system to optimise choice of swimmers – I was a volunteer swim coach. So I wanted to win in our meets, but I wanted all swimmers to have a chance to compete. That was 1982. But I wanted the colour, so stepped up to an Apple ][ clone when I returned. Programmed my taxes in a Multiplan spreadsheet that loaded in linked sections – 64K of memory (I had an expansion card) used 48K for Multiplan, so only 16K bytes left. 1 page/schedule per load… Now I have a 8-core i7, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of flash drive, 2 screens, and it’s the internet slowing me down. Hmm fibre? I do devote 85-100% of my CPU to various BOINC projects.

Then there’s my main preoccupation – Duplicate Bridge. I am “0 carbon” on BBO and direct tournaments for the BBO Fans club, as well as play bridge. I created a goulash bridge bidding system called KwikQ.

Summers I get out, walk my poodle, canoe, hike, bike. But then I always bike . I sold my Pathfinder 5 years ago and it’s bike, hike or bus for me now.

I enjoy photography. My OM system is now obsolete, but adaptors let me use the lenses on my EOS. Still, for eBay, I use an S710IS. Small sensor cameras are unmatched for their macro ability and convenience.

I haven’t found my ideal space in Ottawa (or anywhere) yet. Anyone who wants to live with someone with too many books and too much furniture and too much interest in Bridge should contact me.

People will say something, or I'll read a quote, or hear a song and it will be there for the next few weeks, or months, or years. Many times, it is there, floating above the head of the person who said it in perpetuity. The words slice into my skin and stay there. Sometimes I write them on my arms and legs. I don't have any tattoos yet. I haven't found anything that I have wanted for long enough. 

I spent forever wrapping myself in paper and rope, hoping no one would see all the emotions in me, because they were all so ugly. Now my person tells me that ""sometimes, you scare me with the way you act so easily."" It's a nicer way to say that I'm a liar. A lifetime of self defense seeps into my words. I am sorry if that scares you. It scares me too. I like to write in my little blog, I can unhinge my jaw and tell the truth. That's my rule for when I write. I have to tell the truth. The stories have to be true. 

Once someone tried to drown me. It didn't work out too well, but it made my trust issues so much bigger.

Sometimes making through the day or the week is a struggle. 

I'm kind of particular about what I spend time on, but people I can be generous with. I mix hostility and kindness easily, but it's all in my mind. I am the best person I can be when I can help or hold someone, or provide a listening ear. 

I love it when people laugh. I don't have many friends, but the ones I do make me laugh like you wouldn't believe. I'm a cackler. It is cathartic. Cats and goats never fail to make me laugh. Clever writing can get me. 

I love stories of all kinds. Please feel free to write to me and tell your stories or thoughts, or your favorite song or poem or show or movie and why. Or don't. I'd love to make new friends and talk to new people. I love to get excited about new things, which generally means anything. I'm a blank slate in most departments, I haven't seen any of the world or many of the people in it and I promise to talk to anyone who wants to talk to me. Tell me about things you love and things you hate and things that make you cackle, because I really hope I'm not the only person who laughs like that.

The most important things I've figured out so far in this life (22 years, wow) are that apologies can make or break the connections you have. Decide which you want to do. Either can be okay. If it helps your mental health, go outside and scream loudly. Just not next to the neighbors. Make it a point to not hurt people. Don't be afraid to comfort people. Hold their hand or just sit and be with them. The kindest moments in my life have involved people just sitting and being quiet with me. The precious words that are always in my head are not always comforting. Just think and be kind. That's the best I could ever hope to tell anyone.

Thanks for reading the ramblings. I'll gladly read and respond to anyone who wants me to . The emails I get help me to feel loved.

March 2014,25,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/03/25/myths-and-realities/,"March 2014, 25",Myths and Realities,"A few lessons from political science:

1.      Campaign contributions don’t buy congressional votes.  Yes, there is a positive correlation between contributions and voting patterns, but think about it – if you’re directing the NRA’s Political Action Committee, are you more likely to donate to people you know support you already, or diehard supporters of gun control?  Study after study shows that contributions don’t buy votes.

2.      Spending millions of dollars on political campaigns is a good thing.  Well, in some ways – costly campaigns deter some people from getting involved, but political advertising is not inherently evil.  In fact, research shows that the more money is spent on campaigns, the more voters know about the candidates, issues, and the candidates’ position on issues.  Believe it or not, advertisements can actually be informative, and voters actually show the ability to filter out incorrect or misleading information.

3.      Citizens United, while it may have been a flawed decision, is not as big a deal as people make it out to be.  The Supreme Court never actually said “corporations are people,” and corporations STILL CANNOT DONATE GENERAL TREASURY MONEY TO CANDIDATES OR PARTIES.  All Citizens United did was make it so corporations can now engage in independent expenditures – that is, they can spend money on advertising in favor/against a candidate as long as they don’t coordinate with the candidates’ campaigns.

4.      The two-party system is not the root of all evil.  Third parties do not lose in American Politics because of the “tyranny” of the two major parties, but rather because of our winner-take-all electoral system (Duverger’s Law).  Anyone who complains that Democrats and Republicans don’t offer “real choices” ignores the dramatic polarization that has occurred between the parties in the last 40 years.  Moreover, complaining that the two-party system offers a “lack of choice” ignores the fact that anyone can run as a third party if they want to --- but a more effective strategy is to get involved in primaries and try to change the parties from within.

5.      Presidents aren’t as important as we think they are.  Yes, Presidents are important and influential – but they can’t work magic.  This is a simple lesson that everyone gets in grade school, yet it seems to be forgotten when people think about politics – the President has to get the agreement of Congress to get anything done.  Peoples’ list of “greatest” Presidents just so happened to be in office when their copartisans controlled the House and Senate (FDR, Lincoln, Washington, etc).  Complaining that nothing gets done and then blaming it on the President for not “leading” is completely nonsensical and betrays a misunderstanding of how government works.

6.      Political “independents” are usually not very independent.  Most people who identify as independent actually are closet partisans – they vote and act and think like Republicans or Democrats while refusing to identify as such.  The importance (and estimated total) of independent voters in elections is overblown by observers and pundits.

7.      Nate Silver is great, but political scientists have been accurately forecasting elections using statistical evidence at least since the 1970s.

8.      Last but not least, political science is not an opinion-based discipline.  Just because people have opinions about politics does not make the field opinion-based.  Political scientists use all the tools of contemporary social science – use of quantitative and statistical evidence is actually the norm.

Signed,

March 2014,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/03/24/on-casinos-and-humanity/,"March 2014, 24",On Casinos and Humanity,"I’ve worked in the casino industry for over eleven years, with almost nine of them in Surveillance. In the past eleven years, I’ve lost a lot of hope in humanity. I’ve seen guests attempt to cheat the casino. I’ve seen employees steal from the company.

Those are to be expected. Those people keep me employed. What really pisses me off, though, is someone stealing from someone else. The worst are when the victim comes back and asks the suspect if they’ve seen their lost item – whether it’s cash, a cell phone, or even a cane (yes, a cane!) – and the suspect flat-out lies to the victim. To stare someone in the face and deny knowing anything about their lost $100, knowing it’s burning a hole in your pocket (or, in most cases, being lost with every pull of the handle), has to be one of the worst things you could do to someone.

What’s surprising is that these actions have no stereotypical look. I’ve watched homeless people do it, and I’ve watched players with thousands of dollars on the table do it. All genders. All races. All ages. No one, in our mind, is immune to the almighty dollar. I’ve even seen a victim of one theft become the suspect in another just an hour later. When she was approached, her justification was that because it happened to her, she couldn’t see why she couldn’t do it.

Just recently, I watched dozens of people take advantage of an error at a cash-out machine. Our employee put $20s in the cassette that was supposed to hold $5s, so when someone cashed out a ticket or a bill that would normally pay in $5s, they received $20s. While most of the people only did it once, several did it multiple times – to the tune of a few hundred to a few thousand in profit for them. The only reason it stopped was because a cocktail server broke a $20 for a guest and saw the problem.

The only way I can understand everyone’s reasoning is that they consider it a small win in their favor against a house (even if that house is another person) who has been “cheating” them since day one. For once, they found a way to beat us, even if it meant going against their morals and ethics (not to mention breaking the law). If it were the other way – $5s were in the $20s, for instance – the first person would have run to an employee and complained; they might have even used the phrase “cheated me” when speaking to the employee.

I don’t know if there are studies conducted on the thoughts and actions of guests and employees the moment they walk through the front door of a casino. If there are, I’d love to know about them. I want to understand their thought process as they pick up the $100 bill they just saw fall from someone’s hand. I want to know why employees think that extra $100 is worth losing their paycheck over.

I hope my view of humanity is flawed. Please email me and let me know it is. Give me examples of how others are fighting against this ignorance I observe on a daily basis. Better yet, tell me YOUR story of honesty and morality.

And, if you have any questions about the casino industry, especially about Surveillance, feel free to ask. I’m very knowledgeable about the industry and am willing to dispel, or possibly validate, the rumors or stories you’ve heard.

“Great. My face is getting red. Oh man...can they tell my face is getting red? I look so dumb...my face is bright red. What does this person think of me?  And now it’s getting worse. Does what I’m saying even make sense? My face is more red now. Why does this happen so much? Now I just feel like a fool.”

During conversations with people I knew well, my face would turn bright red before I even interacted with them. The mere thought of talking with another person made my skin boil.

I went online. I read articles. I even thought about seeing a therapist at one point.  I asked close friends. How was I going to fix this? I can’t live like this. It became worse the more I thought about it.

I was pushed around and bullied in middle school. I had a friend who used to tell me to “shut up Matt. Nobody cares what you have to say” for no good reason at all, which is likely related. I was a small guy, so I was a pretty easy target.

...Kids are the worst sometimes.

Anyway, after some years of struggling with this problem, I serendipitously stumbled upon a book: Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People.”

“How to Win Friends and Influence People” is a guide to effective human interaction. All of the little things I once took for granted; the value of smiling, saying people’s names, asking questions, showing genuine appreciation, are all broken down in their simplest forms.

I followed it like a bible. The book’s principles forced me to focus on the other person rather than my own thoughts. I put myself in uncomfortable situations. I forced myself to be okay with my insecurities. I realized that if I wanted to fix the problem I needed to dedicate myself to solving it.

About a year later, I found myself having a conversation with somebody new. “And…wait a second...my face isn’t red. No way! It’s cause I wasn’t even thinking about it!”

Now I’m comfortable addressing crowds of hundreds. Some people even approach me afterwards and say how great of a public speaker I am. Crazy what can be changed in just a few years of intense focus.

Now, I spend my time writing, engineering and producing electronic music under the name Hyperbits. If you're into that sort of thing, here are some thoughts about making the transition from life-sucking-cubicle-slave into full-time music producer and DJ. 1. Being an artist is all about creating a volume of work. For more on this, Google ""The Gap by Ira Glass"" and watch the 2-minute video by Daniel Frohlocke, it could change your life. 2. There is literally no man living that cannot do more than he thinks he can. So stay up late, drink some coffee, keep your head down and get to work. Do WHATEVER it takes to stay positive and stay inspired. Personally, I would take persistence over talent any day of the week. 3. Trust yourself and go with your gut. If you don't like your job or what you do everyday, just move on. It's very easy to get caught up in what other people or even what society thinks is best for you. But generally speaking, no one knows you better than you. So, do you. 4. I once read an analogy that doing creative work is a lot like sending messages in a bottle out to sea. You keep sending them and sending them and every once in a while, something will eventually come back to you.  5. ""You don't need an expensive studio to make expensive sounding records. I guarantee some of your favorite tracks were made on headphones in hotel rooms on half broken computers. You don't need connections, you need passion and talent. Anyone can open the door for you, but it's you that has to break the thing down and show that you deserve to be in the room."" - Nick Thayer For anyone still reading I leave you with this: The secret to good eggs is low heat.

This fall I'm turning 38, and I have no family of my own, I don't own a home, and since about a year I no longer own a car. According to society and its standards, and therefore large parts of my surroundings, these points indicate personal failure. I know my family and my friends love me, but the notion is always there. The judging. The whispers. The nodding. All this because this little word: own.

This gets to me more than I want to admit, even though I have a good-paying job, I have a first hand contract on an apartment, and I had an awesome car. What gets me most are the standards we abide, that we’re supposed to want to have all those things. The fact that people are mindless sheep wanting all those things doesn’t bother me as much.

Marriage: The accrediting from a board of people ruling a virtually defined area of land and/or a board of people wanting you to pay them for the idea of that a guy lived some two thousands years ago and did good stuff and you should believe in him, that you love someone. Come on.

Kids: There are so many children in this world that don’t have parents, or have parents that can’t or won’t take care of them. Is it then really okay to put more kids into this rotting world out of an egoistic need/want?

Home: Although it’s very nice to have somewhere to live, Most of you home-owners don’t own a home. You’re merely assumed by a bank that you’re getting paid often and regular enough for them to lend you money and amazingly high interest rates. You are debt-owners, not home-owners. It should be possible to build and maintain a decent home based on a decent salary, which is not the case today.

Car: It’s quite awesome to have a car, to be able to go where you want and when you want. The problem is that most of the time you’re just using the car as a temporary cure to your own laziness, going to the store or to work or somewhere else. Most people live where there’s adequate public transportation. This is an inexcusable burden on the local environment. If I need a car for something specific, I can borrow or rent one. My bike is also an excellent way of transportation, with the added value of exercise and fresh air.

I just want to step off this ride, don’t want to be a part of it anymore. I can’t be part of it in a way that rest of you think is good enough, apparently. And this hurts me. Next month, I am moving back to Sweden, where I can regroup my thoughts, enjoy nature and fresh air. Hopefully I will have a better stance in a few months, and hopefully I’m relieved of most of the stress tearing me apart since a few years.

My friend Björn is about to take a very logical step towards his real happiness, with contesting all of these things mentioned above. Please find his project Burning Land where you can read more about his wonderful ideas.

Luckily, I got my heart broken by a guy who rides. When we broke up, I missed him—but I missed his bike more.

Writing was always my gateway to freedom, but after getting on a bike, I quickly realized the mind cannot be truly free if the body isn't granted that same freedom.

Yes, motorbikes are great breakup cures—I can channel all that churning gut anger and lingering nostalgia into my own sweaty road trips through the desert—but my bike has done so much more for me.

It introduced me to a community of intrepid, selfless people I never would have met otherwise. It led me to steel and rust and grease and oil, winding roads that twist into mountain valleys, tucked-away dive bars, the smell of the pavement, and dreams I never could have conjured without the agency this simple, two-wheeled machine creates for me.

If you already ride, you know all this. If you don't ride, give it a try. There's nothing like it.

Just wanna share two of my favourite quotes at the moment. Hopefully they will make you feel better like how they have done for me all these while. :) 

""If you have good thoughts, they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.""

As I grow older and enter the workforce, it seems like people around me are just getting so mean and would anything just to achieve what they want. But yes, staying positive and being kind even to those who hurt us will make us all look lovely.

""Eventually all pieces fall into place. Until then, laugh at the confusion, live for the moment, and know that everything happens for a reason.""

Growing up can be confusing and depressing at times. I am currently at this stage of my life where I feel so lost about my future, especially after facing so many obstacles within half a year into my first proper job. So yup, I'm gonna try to gain as much experience as I can instead of crying over spilled milk all the time.

I believe that some of you out there also have quotes that resonate with you, or quotes that you live by. For example, my gluttony boyfriend always says ""Leave no fries behind"" and he really meant it every time he said it.

Germany - It was my dream to work abroad. Few months after graduating I got chance to get a job in Germany as a project manager/SEO specialist. The problem was, I had to leave my friends and family in just 2 weeks, what appeared to me as the hardest thing. The challenge was really big: getting used to new people, new language, new culture and becoming profi in areas I hadnt had relevant experiences before. After two and half months I was fired.

I was thinking a lot about this experience and got following conclusion:

1. ""I do not regret the things I've done, but those I did not do."" (Rory Cochrane) - Sometimes we are stucked in deciding whether to do something or not. In my opinion it is worthwhile to give a try. Staying in Germany gave me life lecture I would not get otherwise in 10 years.

2. Give 100% to anything.    Nobody is perfect. It is not fair to blame yourself in case you didn´t succeed. More important is to do everything you are able and qualified to. If you know you made you best, do not care with thoughs about lost opportunity, but prepare for those upcoming!

3. Be happy to share your time with friend and family - In my opinion, this is how one can live his/her life peacefully and satisfied. Having just enough money or perfect job is not enough, if we do not have people to share it with. Schedule appointment with your friends or family today and enjoy any moment you can be with them.

I knew from the very day I signed up for the Listserve. It was not the reason that I signed up but nevertheless I knew and will get to that reason in the third paragraph.  Please keep reading to that point but first a suggestion for the administrators of the Listserve.

I would like to see an archive site. Maybe by month and year. A site that will provide a link to reread the emails from the winners on a certain date.  It would also be nice to have a rating system and comments thread for the people on the Listserve to be able to continue with or start some conversations.  I have kept several of the emails that I enjoyed and conversed with a few people along the way. Special mentions to: Fred, Manuel Loureiro, Leah R, M Willis,  Charles Austin,  Jason Rosenbaum,  Jennifer Cox,  Adam,  Ariel A,  Yakira Levy,  Lief Bloomquist,  John Huber,  Chris Powell,  Alyissa and Anthony Albright. I have kept your emails and enjoy them for varied reasons. That is why I would like to see an archive site.

Now on to my turn. I started writing a book just last week. I was going to start last year but decided more research was in order and waited. I was hoping that I would have my turn this year because I wanted to ask the People of Listserve for help. I am writing a book about science, philosophy, and religion and their interplay. I would like to get input and opinions from a varied group and the Listserve is the very best group I can think of for that. It spans most cultures, religions, education levels and geographical areas in the world as best I can tell.  In essence, it is perfect for what I would like to request.

So here is the request: please reply to the email address below with your email address. Later this year and as need dictates I will send you a few questions and ask for your opinions on the subject material above. If enough people reply and I have a significantly sized group it will become a cited source in the book. Basically you can become part of a poll group. I promise not send too much and will never ask for anything other than your email and opinion. Once the book is completed I will let you know and you can see what you are a part of.

Yes, Austin has more live music venues per capita than anywhere else on the planet and Fortune Magazine calls Google the best company to work for, year after year.

At 25 years old, I have lived and visited some of the most beautiful places in the world, including Boulder, San Francisco, Seattle, Bolivia, Haiti, France, Senegal, United Arab Emirates and India and established the most fruitful friendships I could ever imagine.

At 25 years old, I've been in love exactly three times and find myself single for the first time in eight years and in my adult life. In retrospect, it amazes me to have discovered three drastically different people who I can love equally and will always love in some capacity the rest of my life. Love hurts, but it hurts so good.   

At 25 years old, I have never felt so humbled as I do in this moment, with the opportunity to share a few words with a {presumably} attentive audience and reflect on a blessed life that I don't take for granted for an instant.

My name is Heather Koski and I grew up in rural Colorado, in a town of 700 inhabitants. Throughout our childhood, my parents encouraged my two sisters and I to think outside of the box of our hometown and dream big. 

That idea commenced with an academic year abroad for each of us, in Finland, France and Australia, respectively, and evolved into a love of traveling, curiosity of different cultures and the constant yearning to learn more to enhance our minds and engage our souls.

While living in France, I became enamored by words and the comfort I found in writing as I was learning to speak French. At this time, I also found great joy in running, which eventually transitioned into high school track and now competitive racing.

I can honestly say that my life is presently a pleasant combination of my education, interests and dreams, but that I'm not satisfied yet. At which point, time constraints have ceased my writing, but I leave you with a quote that has always resonated with me:

""Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go."" 

- T.S. Eliot

Dream big, be humble.

It's like having a midlife crisis at my 20's, did any of you been thru that feeling?

Is it suffering the reason our hearts grow old? Let that sink in.Short story: last year I met Steven Tyler and I was so nervous that started to dry crying after I talked him, what? you don't know what ''dry crying'' is?

That is when you're so overwhelmed that you can't even deal with your own self, literally I found myself crying ''outside in''.Then again, Je ne sais pas where I'm heading anymore, by this time, I was supposed to be somewhere else, to be honest, I was expecting more from myself.

I'm a photographer and also started to run a blog with one of my friends, that it's pretty much about music, fashion brands and the impact they have in society and 90's shows that me and my best friend miss a lot, we decided to call it The True Blog.

Since a young age I started traveling, my first trip was to Barbados and I'm coming back in a couple of months.

Short story: what I do most of the time of the year is going to concerts, so, once I asked Ozzy Osbourne: ''Ozzyyyyy, can you choke me?''

Yeahh, I know, please don't tell me how ridiculous that sounds, thank God there were only five people in the room when I asked that.

Did I say where I'm from? well, if you look at a map, there's a really tiny country, called El Salvador.

I wonder if Lady Gaga is subscribed to the listserve, can you imagine getting a e-mail from her?

it would be cool, a couple years ago I lost a piece of my heart, my grandma, men, I swear she was like, the coolest human being ever and I still love her, the same way I loved her the first day I saw her.

Last short story:Marilyn Manson, Tampa, if any of the people who was backstage is here: HELLO EVERYONE!

Meeting this man was awesome, I literally ran to him and gave him a huge hug, he hugged me back too, I gave him action figures of Vilma and Scooby, the main topic was Scooby Doo, I told him literally everything and more!When the girl was about to take our picture, I threw my leg right over him and told him ''Believe me, it will look great for the photo''

I'm laughing while writing this, he probably don't even remember any of this.

That's it guys!

Now let me hear about you!

What would the perfect blog be like? tell me by your own words

Are any of you catching the last Motley Crüe tour? my instagram is the name I said you could call me like at the beginning.

What do you guys do for fun?

But now that I have been chosen, it's hard to come up with a subject.

So I'll start introducing myself. Hi! My name is Thais, I'm 18 years old and I live in one of the biggest cities in the world, Sao Paulo - Brazil. I've just been back from an exchange program; I spent a whole year in Australia thanks to an organization called Rotary International.

And that is what I was going to talk about: Travel and why you should travel (more). But I must confess that I was starting to get bored myself. So, instead, I want to recommend you a method that can help you grow (whether professionally, socially or personally).  Now that I’m 18, I’m becoming responsible for more and more things, so I must apply more discipline into my life.

This method was suggested by an important bank president from Wall Street, New York.  He said:“I keep an agenda where I write down all the appointments that I have that day. My family never makes any plans for me on Saturday evenings, because they know I use these evenings to process and exam my conscience and then review and evaluate it.

After dinner I open my agenda and remember all the things I had to do during the week.

I ask myself: ‘What are the mistakes I made during the week?’

‘What did I do that was correct? What are the things I could’ve done better?’

‘What can I learn from this experience?’

I’ve felt unhappy many times when processing my agenda. It surprises me the number of things I did wrong. But, of course, after some time the number of mistakes you make become smaller and smaller. I even congratulate myself from time to time.

This method of self-analysis, self-education, year after year, has done more to me than any other thing I’ve ever tried. It’s been helping me to improve my capability to make decisions and to deal with people.

I can’t recommend it but with much enthusiasm “

Yes, you should travel as many times as possible like I was going to write about. But I think you should definitely try this new method and see how it goes. You’ll probably learn most of the things during your life anyway, but I think this way should be easier and faster. What do you think? And if you do try it, I’d love to hear from you!

All the very best,Tudo de melhor,

March 2014,11,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/03/11/life-after-asperger-syndrome-diagnosis/,"March 2014, 11",Life after Asperger Syndrome diagnosis,"My motivations for joining the Listserve were part of my drive to communicate more with 'the world' and coincided with starting a blog (Science on the Spectrum) were I aim to discuss my scientific career aspirations through the lens of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). I was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome in 2012, a 'higher functioning' form of autism. This affects how a person makes sense of the world, processes information and relates to other people but because I am intelligent and outwardly appear capable, these disabilities are largely hidden. I have difficulty with the subtleties in verbal communication, such as understanding facial expressions and voice tone and knowing what people are thinking, explaining the problems I have experienced in interacting with others throughout my life. It is not all disadvantageous though, my condition is also associated with obsessive interests, a high attention to detail and love of pattern recognition which are valuable attributes for a career in science. It is therefore no surprise that those 'on the spectrum' are overrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) and that I should be drawn to this career from an early age.

It is not until recently that ASD has received more awareness and it was the opening of a clinic in my local area that prompted me to consider being officially diagnosed. It was not a decision I took lightly, as I was unsure whether having a 'label' would be a help or hindrance from a personal and career perspective. However I was applying for a full time Master of Science degree which would necessitate moving to London and having to live independently rather than rely on my parents' care and a diagnosis would give me access to support. I researched the experiences of others and discussed it with my family and General Practitioner/family doctor before deciding it was worth pursuing.

Since my diagnosis my attitude to my difficulties has changed, instead of constantly feeling inadequate for my social failings, for example when I attend a conference but am too scared to talk to many people it instead feels an achievement to have gone at all. Rather than a burden, I see my difficulties as a challenge to overcome and to that end decided to stop letting the fear of other people hold me back and 'feel scared but do it anyway'. With support from my family and the university's disability team, last year I achieved my ambition to gain a Master of Science studying at the Natural History Museum in London where I have continued to volunteer on a research project on earthworms - but that is another story!

I would be interested to hear the experiences of other STEM workers with autistic spectrum or other communication disorders.

It's a great life and a good job.But my real job, my real passion is mining exploration. When they asked me what I wanted to be as a kid, I never had an answer, I guess it was because I never knew that what I would come to do was an option.

So what is the mining law 1876? It's easiest to explain with a question. If you're out on public land in the western USA, and you stumble upon a billion dollar gold vein, who owns that? The answer is the first person to  stake a claim and pay your claim fees to the local county and federal government. Claims can be a max of about 20 acres, and the fees for them are only a few hundred dollars a piece. 

Now growing up in Chicago, I never had a single idea this was a thing. It was only when I moved to Nevada that it was introduced to me. I was actually in the process of developing land for a music festival when the mineral rights under my feet sold for millions. And that's what piqued my interest.

Think about it this way, we only completed the teams continental railroad about 135 years ago. That's when we first crossed the West, what lies beneath those millions of square miles is just waiting to be explored. 

I started exploring for minerals, particularly gold and Iron Ore in 2007. Since then, I've started two companies and made some amazing discoveries of unknown ore bodies. Hopefully within a year we'll start mining and shipping iron ore overseas to Chinese steel mills.

I'm glad I found this interesting line of work, without it I don't know what I'd have done. It's still kind of funny to me that I'm a ski bum by day, and manage million dollar mining projects on the weekends. I try not to let it get to my head, and I keep my jobs separate. no one at my ski bum job  knows about my mining job, and my mining associates don't know I'm a ski bum by day. I like it that way.

Feel free to shoot me an email, I love talking about mining and exploration, and if you haven't seen it yet, check out the show ""Gold rush Alaska.""

I have a running list of 100+ startup ideas that are locked and loaded, but I’ll never be able to execute all of them, so I decided to use this opportunity to share some of my favorites that I won’t pursue with you.

Maybe you feel inspired and start working on one of them. If you do so, please let me know. I’m happy to support and would love to know how they’re going.

1. Device: Ever ran out of battery and didn’t have a charger in reach? What if friends could connect their phone to yours and give you some of their precious battery life to keep it going? Think of this as a device small enough to hang from a keychain. A small adapter that allows you to connect one device to the other and donate power. Is there a better way to connect?

2. App: Wouldn’t it be cool if you could share a playlist with friends that everyone can contribute to real-time? Basically an app that allows everyone in reach to add songs. All contributors see what’s coming and can vote songs up and down in the queue. Perfect for offices and house parties.And who says DJs wouldn’t use it to get instant feedback from the crowd?

3. App: Get up! A social network that motivates you to get up early in the morning. You can share the time you set your alarm and see which of your friends are still sleeping. In the end, there’s nothing more motivating than knowing that your friends are already getting things done while you’re still snoozing.

4. Mobility concept: There are some great car sharing concepts that are launching in major cities, but they all lack one thing: Reach. Why isn’t there a service that allows users to contribute vehicles? Imagine you could invest in an electro scooter and choose where you want to place it. Whenever someone uses your scooter, you get a cut. The company would only facilitate deals and maintain the vehicles. A city-spanning mobility network could evolve.

I’m a product manager living in New York City and I have big dreams.

Some things I think everyone should know/do in life:

1) Do theater!I can't stress this enough. I started doing musical theater late (in my early 20s), and it also happened to be one of the worst times in my life. I had just lost a younger brother during my first show. I got into theater because of my love of music and singing. I wasn't a very confident person during those years, but my voice teacher insisted I audition for a show. So I did, and was cast in ""West Side Story"" and it literally changed my life. I became more confident in myself, I got out of my depression, and I met some of the most amazing people i'd ever meet. I met most of my lifelong friends in theater. There was something uplifting about being around so many people that have the same love and passion for the arts as I did. Theater was my therapy. I performed for almost 10 years in the San Francisco bay area and fit in a show whenever I can (I am now a self employed stay at home dad, so making it to rehearsals is tough these days. Haha).

3) Suicide sucksThis one is going to get a bit personal. I survived suicide twice. Now, you're probably thinking I was the one that attempted suicide... You're wrong though. My father committed suicide when I was a baby, and my step father committed suicide when I was 14. Being someone that had to pick up the pieces emotionally was devastating. I spent most of my childhood trying to keep myself and my family intact. Because of their selfish choice, I lost out on my childhood and my teen years. I'm not going to go too into detail though, it's pretty personal. I just want all of you that have been through the same thing to know, that you are not alone. I am in my mid 30s and still trying to recover from the losses I've had in my life. You can never recover 100% when someone you love takes their own life.

4) Star Trek is not for nerds/geeksStar trek was/is one of the most well written shows ever created. It transcends generations. It is so forward thinking and amazing everyone should watch it. From the technology, the thought of a moneyless way of living, and the integration of all species, it was/is way ahead of its time. Gene Roddenberry created an amazing world within Star Trek, and I for one am thrilled that they re imagined it! The new films are a great mix of action and star trek lore. My favorite series is TNG and I hope they someday re imagine it as well

Lastly, I want to thank my old Apple co-worker Tim Kretchmer for turning me on to ""The Serve"". I have really enjoyed reading everyone else’s messages. I hope some of you can take something positive away from my message.

If any of you are in the San Francisco bay area, look me up. I do photography, video, digital audio, event DJing, graphic design, and build custom ""Hackintosh"" computers (now that I no longer work for Apple). I love making new contacts and meeting new people. Feel free to drop me a line anytime. My website is the same as my email ""Omnisonas""

Take care everyone, and thanks for reading my entry in the listserve

Like: ""this is a story all about how Kurt Vonnegut is never gonna give you up?"" or something.

Oh, right! Advice! Hmm...Read more Borges?

And definitely take yourself less seriously. Well except for those things that are super important, you should totally be serious about those things.

Eat more or less kale, depending on your preferences.

Always devote yourself to worthy pursuits. Like oh hey Bill (who I know is reading this), remember that time you spent like 10 hours trying to get a video game corpse into a video game glass case? Good times.

Oof. This basically turned into a somehow less intelligible EddieIzzard-style list of left-behind commandments (e.g. ""never put jam on a magnet""). Sorry everyone. Good news though, super earnest replies will most likely be back tomorrow!

March 2014,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/03/06/i-never-knew-i-was-strong/,"March 2014, 06",I never knew I was strong,"Every time I write, I know that what I’m trying to say will never get across in the way that I want it to. I’m out of practice, I can never find the words I need and I’m a really terrible speller. But actually, writing this email, I have no idea what I’m going to say. So consider this an experiment.

I am a college senior pursuing a degree in graphic design and marketing. And I have a lot of questions. I guess that’s appropriate, since one of the largest events of my short life is approaching much too quickly. That being said, I feel that I am in no position to give anybody any sort of advice and honestly I feel like any wisdom I may have had has been drowned out by many recent nights (and some days) of beer and tequila running seamlessly into working on my design thesis until sunrise. But hey, it’s only in college that I can get away with posting a video of myself chugging a beer with pickle juice on the Internet, right?

If there is anything that I feel I need to take this opportunity to say, it’s this: The people who love me have changed my life. As much as I am confused, overwhelmed and questioning the future, I know that I am strong and resilient and I can face whatever graduation brings. It wasn’t long ago that I didn’t know these things. It’s not that I thought I was weak, I just never knew I was strong. I never understood that people saw a confidence in me because I never knew it existed. I quietly questioned myself, my decisions, my appearance, every single day.

There have been a few particular people in my life the past few years that have completely changed how I look at myself, my potential for happiness, love, and success. Their selfless words and actions have made me such a better version of myself, and because of them I will always pay this forward. They fuel my love of life, my creativity, my terrible dance moves, and a happiness that I didn’t know I was missing. Although I still can cry over the smallest of things, I know it’s just because I am so filled with love and appreciation. So I want to publicly say thank you to these people for allowing me to learn who I am. I’m so sorry I don’t say it more often. I really hope you know who you are, and I love you.

Well, I honestly did not think that this was going to be so soppy, but with the weight of almost 25,000 pairs of eyes I felt a strong urge to say something important. This is honestly the most important thing I can say, although I’m sure it was diluted by spelling mistakes and run on sentences.

Well, this is also important: I am seeking employment post graduation doing anything design related in New York City. I have no idea what kind of place I want to work, where I am going to live, or what my new life will be like. All I know is that I need to surround myself with these kinds of people who make me this better version of myself.  If you have any advice about how to tackle the next stage of my life or any ideas for cool job opportunities, please send me an email.

I've read most of the things that listserve sent to me.  Enjoyed it a bunch.

Never thought I would be picked to say things to all of you.  So what things should I say?

I am what most would consider an old woman.  Technology only got really started in my early twenties.  I love technology and hope to live long enough to enjoy some of the new things that I know will be here.  A few days ago I discovered a web site that made gif files look 3D.  Got to say I am impressed.  A small thing but interesting.

The internet is ....... for me........... a wonderful place to learn new things.  A great place to see photos of places I will never go.

So many minds serving up so much.  Things my generation would have never thought of.  I just love it.

There is one part though that I would like to see more of.  It would be something that would help old people like me meet other old people.  No, not a dating site.  I don't know what kind of site it could be but something that would help people my age meet each other.  Maybe a club of some sort.  I just don't know.

If anyone reading this has ideas I would like to hear them.

I live in Nevada and the longest lasting relationship I had came from meeting a person at a Keno machine.  Of course, I was about twenty years younger then.  We would still be together if he had not decided he had lived long enough with his health problems and died.

I am also curious about the people using list serve.  What sort of age mix do we have here?  Until I got my chance to talk to all of you I thought it was all just young people.

So, I would like to hear from any of you that would like to e mail me.  If you could use advice about how not to do things I might be able to help.  Some say I am a walking disaster when it comes to doing anything in a kitchen for example.

EXPERIENCEForgery, 1st gradeReplicated mother's signature to confirm that she understands a homework assignment was not completed.- Teacher didn't glance twice at masterful forgery- Mother was spared paperwork and disappointment over the missing assignment

[NOTE: timeline discontinuity caused by skipping the 2nd grade]

Buttered Chalkboard, 3rd grade

Coordinated with six classmates to bring sticks of butter to school on prank day.  Before the first bell, teammates slathered butter onto the chalkboard seamlessly.- Teacher didn't notice any butter residue, attempted to write on the board as usual- The board was completely chalk-proof, and curriculum eased for the day- Best friend was sent home with a note inquiring whether there was excess butter at home; best friend's mother confirmed that there was, indeed, excess butter at the house

Sex Equality Protest, 4th grade

Assembled all girls to protest that the boys were assigned to wood shop while the girls were assigned to knitting class- Unified classmates and raised awareness of gender stereotypes- Gleaned insight into wood working- Not a single disciplinary action recorded- After numerous protests, forced back into the rudimentary yarn manipulation class, knitted safe-for-woodworking intarsia gloves of own design and pattern while classmates completed scarf assignment

Tobacco Access Demonstration, 5th grade

Staged a demonstration to draw attention to kids' access to cigarettes by having students bring large supplies of cigarettes to school, then having the hall monitors hand out cigarettes instead of chalk- Numerous attempts by teachers to write with cigarettes on chalkboards; succession of cigarettes snapped- Classes interrupted, responsibilities of hall monitors re-examined- Loyalty and untraceable planning resulted in minimal disciplinary retribution, organizer never identified- Demonstration foresaw anti-smoking movements that followed a decade later

Campus Excursions, 3rd - 5th grade

Led students around elementary school and neighboring high school during school hours- Observed unfamiliar practices among students of various ages, interests, and backgrounds- Introduced student body to novel campus resources- Afforded opportunities for informal, convivial conversations with principal

Surprise Birthday Party, 12th grade

Brought cake, candles, and balloons to a 7:20am AP physics period.  Gathered fellow students in a celebratory performance of ""Happy Birthday"" in honor of the teacher.  It was not the teacher's birthday.  Not even the month.- That's the surprise!- Cake for breakfast for sleepy seniors- Merriment that precluded rigorous physics instruction for the ensuing double period- Smiles and cheer rather than disciplinary action

[NOTE: timeline discontinuity caused by immigration and subsequent abject loneliness and despair spanning 6th-12th grades due to detachment from social network and placement within schools that ignored/devalued all the previously esteemed abilities that allowed mastering a new language in two months and placing into calculus BC at age 15 - but then who cares when you're not born into the school district, right, and you don't conform.

I was wondering what to say to 25,000 strangers, but I think I'll just talk about ""How to be an Adult."" I know, I'm only 25 (nearly 26), but I have experienced quite a bit of life (including the past 3 years working in South Korea).

Today, let's talk about how to walk the fine line between being your own person versus being under your parents.

I won't go into details, but my newly divorced parents are going through a rough time in light of a staggering revelation. I love my parents equally, but it's really hard to take when they are both throwing out terrible thoughts and untrue assumptions about the other. It is worsened by the fact that they both seem to come to me about it, when I am not under their care or protection anymore.

So how does one manage this difficult balance? 3 ways:

1.) By listening.

I just listen, and listen respectfully. There are things that they may need to say, and as hard as it is for me to hear it, it just needs to be said. The point is NOT TO HOLD ON TO THOSE WORDS.* Personally, I do this through my faith in Christ, but the principle holds true. As the saying goes, ""in one ear and out the other."" If I were to hold onto those things, it would absolutely destroy me, which is not fair.

2.) It's their problem, not yours.

I have my own life to live (of which I'm starting a new, terrifyingly exciting chapter), so I need to just let my parents deal with these things on their own. Of course it hurts me to see their hearts breaking, but I can't carry this for them. They're adults too, and while I love and respect them, in the end, it's THEIR ISSUE, NOT MINE.

3.) Pray

Pretty self explanatory. (Feel free to email me about that one.)

I'll end this heavy post with a lame joke:so what did the acorn say when it grew up? ""Geometry!"" (Say it out loud, it will make sense.)

If you have any questions, feel free to email me. I also love snail mail, so if any of you want to be pen pals, also email me!

* caps for emphasis-not shouting.

March 2014,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/03/01/first-wednesday/,"March 2014, 01",First Wednesday,"In college, I ran Cross-Country and Track in Atlanta.  While I’m sure I don’t have to elaborate on why, the bond you gain with your teammates is an inseparable one.  Between the 6:00am Tuesday work-outs, the informal late-night naked running events, and the “drag-out” on Sunday long runs when we’d rehash our Saturday night escapades, there’s a lot of bonding that goes on in the sweaty mix.

After college it becomes increasingly difficult to see each other as often as you once had, and it becomes more and more difficult to maintain the same closeness as you all enter the next phase of your life.  It’s all too easy to fall out of touch and grow apart.

For me, the majority of my closest friends from my team live in New York City.  It shouldn’t be that surprising (because NYC is the shit and who wouldn’t want to live in this city?) but it is something that I took for granted for a while.  Of course, we’d get together some Saturdays at someone’s apartment for a pre-game and then go out to some dive bar (when it was up to me) or some schmancy bar (when it was up to my finance friends). It was actually my parents though that made me realize I should make a stronger effort to see all my friends outside of the weekend haze.

Thus, “First Wednesday” was created.  On the first Wednesday of every month, one person gets to choose a restaurant for dinner and we all go out of our way to be there. (I added a stipulation that if you miss First Wednesday, you have to send hand-written, mailed apology letters to all those who did make it to dinner explaining why you missed the occasion, but only one friend has followed through on that.)  I understand this isn’t anything groundbreaking: dinner parties?! Am I the first one to ever think of that?! The point is: I have really great friends and getting together for a designated time each month is a really special thing.  What’s even better?  All of my friends have made it a priority as well.

At the ripe age of 26, I’m realizing more and more everyday how fortunate I am and not to take advantage of it.  Though it feels life gets busier by the day, I’ve always made a concentrated effort to visit my loving, supportive parents in upstate New York, my kick-ass, soon-to-be married brother in California, and my best friend and amazing sister (who just had a baby boy, Graham!) in Rochester.  College, I mentioned—but did I mention I was a Chinese major too? (<3 Shanghai, 我想念您). For the last four years I’ve been working as a middle school teacher in the South Bronx and recognize how unique it is for me to be absolutely in love with my job.  I have a great apartment that I share with my boyfriend and our Mastiff mix, Maizey, who adorably loves to army crawl between us in bed in the middle of the night.

And now I feel like I’m able to appreciate, on new levels, what an amazing network of friends I have and why it’s so important to carve out time with them.  As I’ve moved through each new stage of my life, I’m grateful that both my friends and I have made a more concerted effort to stay close.

Feel free to e-mail me about friendships, Chinese, teaching, puppies, and any other thoughts

On storytelling, climate change, and playfully exploring our futures.

—

There’s a glitch in the software system in the near future – what sort? How should I know, it’s in the future. The important part is that this glitch sends voicemails back to our time.

And what do we hear? We hear voices from the cloud of many possible futures. We are eavesdropping on the many parallel paths our world could take. We get to listen to the messages that people leave for each other – by turns banal, mysterious, tender, and terrifying.

—— Ready for a CHALLENGE? ——

Take a moment to think about what one of those voicemails might sound like.

PEOPLE: Who is calling? Who are they playing phone tag with? What’s their relationship?

THE AUTHENTIC FUTURE: What clues you in that this is taking place in the future? What’s different?

So why did I ask you to do that? Well, I think fiction can be a powerful tool to think about the future. Great technologists can tell us that when we network computers together it’ll be a powerful tool – but it takes writers of fiction like William Gibson and Neal Stephenson to help us imagine what that might mean on a personal level. Biologists can tell us that we can handcraft genetic code – but it takes an author like Margaret Atwood to help us envision what it could be like to live in that future.

This makes fiction an ideal place to explore an issue like climate change. We hear all sorts of predictions about what climate change will mean in twenty, fourty, sixty years from now – they represent the cloud of possible futures. Most of those take a 10,000 mile, global perspective. Hearing those figures, it’s tough for me to take it in – to really understand what they could mean to me, or to my friends, or children.

Let’s try something. Take a moment to revisit your voicemail. Has the climate changed in this future? How has your caller adapted? How does this show up in the voicemail?

—— Ready to be BRAVE? ——

Take the voicemail that you’ve come up with and call the FutureCoast hotline. Record your voicemail from the future.

+1 (321) 7-FCOAST // +1 (321) 732-6278

International callers – if the long distance is a problem, just record the audio and send it to: 

Full DisclosureFutureCoast – the hotline and the website where the voicemails are published – are part of a collaborative storytelling project created by Ken Eklund and me (Sara Thacher) with a National Science Foundation grant.

Thank you Listervians! We look forward to listening to your futures.

February 2014,27,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/02/27/32-days-a-ghost/,"February 2014, 27",32 days a ghost,"A story for the readers of The Listserve:

For 32 days last fall I was a ghost. Watching people go about their day-to-day lives around me while time seemed to stand still. My son was born 41 days early and spent 32 agonizing (for me) days in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

One Friday night my wife and I were sitting on the couch relaxing after dinner when *POP* her water broke. 6 ½ weeks early. This wasn’t supposed to happen. Women having their first NEVER go early we were told. It did happen.  We rushed to the hospital where our fears were confirmed: Her water had broken. My wife was not leaving the hospital until she delivered the baby, but it was not happening that night.  Over the next 6 days we talked, hugged, and tried to stay calm. In the moments I found myself alone I cried. Fear of the unknown can be terrifying. For 6 days I was terrified, but I didn’t show it. I put on a brave face for my wife and the son I hadn’t yet met. Six days later, once the doctor’s felt the baby’s lungs had fully developed they induced labor. Nearly 24 hours later my son was born. A great size and weight for a preemie we were told.

The next 32 days were a haze of worry, nerves, smiles, tears, and joy. I went back to work, visiting the NICU every day at 5:30 AM before going to the office and again at 6 PM on my way home. My wife was there from mid-morning until mid-evening each day, and we would call the hospital in the middle of the night, sometimes more than once, just to be reassured that he was ok.  I was torn to pieces to see my son hooked up to IVs, a breathing machine, and a feeding tube.

I went through the motions each day, watching as others lived their lives and I could only sit and wait for my life to get going. It was impossible to explain to people how tired I was, how scared I was, and how I would just wish everybody would leave me alone. I ate crappy food, I barely slept, and I tried to put on a brave face.  We were told he was close to going home enough times that, though I cognitively knew it would happen eventually, I had a difficult time believing it.After 32 days my son came home, with no lasting medical issues or signs he had entered the world in such an unexpected way. A very wise nurse in the NICU said to my wife and I “If you don’t tell him he spent 32 days here he would never know it, despite that, you will be scarred for life.” She was right. He is a happy, smiling, drooling, amazing 5 ½ month old and each and every day I look with wonder and amazement as he grows and learns.

That’s it. A story from my heart.

If in parting I can share some unimaginative wisdom it is this:Life is full of unexpected moments, some good ones, some bad ones, and some both good and bad. Getting through each day and starting over the next is all we as humans can do.

It’s ok to cry and ok to be scared. In the end it will all work out, or it won’t.Feel free to share your story with me and thanks for allowing me to share mine.

I never thought I would be picked, let alone know what to write. I look back at all the emails I have received since joining Listserve and I still can’t figure out what to write. I guess a good place to start is to introduce myself.

Hi, I’m Corrine and I’m 17 years. I live in Illinois with my aunt and our two cats.  I started to live with my aunt back in September when my mom ended up in a nursing home.  My mom is unable to take care of herself anymore. I go to visit her once a week in nursing home. Just yesterday (Saturday) we went out for dinner.

I like to do a lot of different things in my free time. I listen to music. My current obsessions are Tegan and Sara, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, David Bowie, Bob Dylan, and Tame Impala. I am also obsessed with Netflix. I’m currently working my way through Orange is the New Black and Supernatural. Both those shows will be the death of me. I also watch a lot of movies.  I just watched The Boys Are Back. I hope to be able to get to the library soon to check out the book that the movie is based on. Generally I try to read the book before I go see the movie.

I also like to Skype/text my boyfriend A LOT.  Well when your boyfriend lives 851.8 miles away you do tend to get a bit attached to technology. I can’t imagine having a long distance relationship before smartphones/internet was invented.  We met online in IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel the night before Easter of 2013. He had sent me a message. At some point during the conversation totally out of character for me I said, “I think I’m falling for you. From there we exchanged numbers. I love him dearly and hope to meet him at some point. I don’t think it will be anytime soon. He just got accepted into fire school and will be becoming an official firefighter.

I love to get to know y’all but before I end this email I will leave you with a few of my favorite quotes:

“A hero is someone who understands the responsibility that comes with his freedom.” -Bob Dylan

""I'm one of those people you have to watch or else I'll wander off into the woods and forget to come back"" -Jack White

""In the future everyone will be world famous for fifteen minutes.""- Andy Warhol

I was sitting in my dorm building watching a movie, Step Brothers to be precise, and as soon as I found out I shouted in the middle of the movie to my friend I got picked. All of my friends present were amazed that I was chosen to write an email to so many people!

A little bit of background knowledge on who I am before I get to my story. I am a freshmen at the University of Minnesota and have no idea what I want to do with my life. I am originally from Colorado and I love the state. I wanted to spread my wings for college so I took a tour early fall last year of the campus. I loved it, middle of a city and it had 50,000 students. I couldn’t be happier! (If you can’t tell I love people!) Now onto my story...

So being that I took a tour of the University in early fall it was a nice 50 or 60 degrees out. I assumed it would be getting colder in the Winter but I enjoy the cold so I decided I would buy a new jacket some under armor and call it good. Holy balls was I wrong! I get to the university and find out my dorm room didn’t have AC. This is no problem in January, but when you arrive to the dorms and its close to 100 degrees out that is a problem. One more problem is when you have only heard how cold it gets you don’t really pack a ton of shorts. I was partying the first night with my new roommates, we went outside and I, in all my wisdom, was wearing jeans. The combination of heat, alcohol, and the overwhelmingness of college made me pass out. My roommates saved me before I hit the ground and put me to bed shortly after. I made an instant connection with them and I love living with them now. So kids if you want a good relationship with you roommates almost hurt yourself and make them help you out haha!

That is my favorite warm weather story so hopefully you got a kick out of it. If you guys want to comment on the story I could elaborate or just laugh at your funny comments. Shoot me an email sometime, about anything at all, if I don’t get to many I’ll email you back! Shout out to my friend patrick who is also on the list serve and I will be quizzing to see if he read my email!

Bye you guys!!!!

I thought about writing about what I do for a living, my interests, my hobbies, but all of them seemed pretty monotonous to a large group of people I probably don’t know. So I just decided I would write my favorite quote and my favorite, go-to joke:

Quote:  The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not ‘Eureka!’ but ‘That’s funny…” –Isaac Asimov

This one strikes true to me after being a math major who worked over a year on a lab-based microbiology senior thesis about C. Diff. I found that things never went right when I wanted, and always went right when I least expected. I had a knack of ruining the simplest of experiences, but accidentally coming up with other results that yielded new insights.

Joke: Always remember, camping is intense.

Definitely a go-to, and those who know me well know that I will drop this line randomly on a fairly regular basis.

So if anyone has any interest in science, my senior thesis, camping, or anything else, feel free to respond and strike up a conversation! I promise, I will try to respond in my free time from studying for these god-awful actuarial exams.

February 2014,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/02/22/513-days/,"February 2014, 22",513 Days,"Hello!

I can sit here and bore you with uninteresting facts about me such as I was born and raised in a city that’s famous for dropping a dead carp on New Year’s Eve. I work for a company called “Trust Point, Inc” where I am a financial planner, dabble in photography, reading Hunter S. Thompson, John Wooden and Mike Krzyzewski. I’m passionate about teaching basic personal finance,  running and being on my motorcycle. But none of that’s important.

I love bringing to light and praising the accomplishments of others; and with that, I’d like to tell you about my best friend.

Even though he was 3 years younger than I, we grew up together, often going up to our family farm to help my Grandpa milk cows. He was more of a “Davey Crockett”, I was more of a “Michael Jordan”.  Despite these differences, we always got along well.

After college he got a job in a small town working at a farm implement fixing tractors, combines and the like. I was working hard to finish my Master’s degree at UW-Madison and he would always stop over to my house on Sunday nights to visit, occasionally have a beer and complain about his co-workers or tell me about the farmland he was renting and raising crops on. I always knew farming was his 'dream come true', but I never told him; I was just happy to see him happy. Those were always the best days of the week for me; just him and me, shooting the breeze.Later on, I moved to a city about an hour away but we remained as close as ever. It seemed to me the older we got, the better we got along. I was grateful and appreciative of having someone that shared my views, stories, and I could learn stuff from. He taught me about farming and I taught him about finance. Honestly, I had played out scenarios in my head of him and I growing old, drinking beer together, and complaining about how “…those damn teenagers are acting today”.

One autumn day, my fiancée was out of town so I came home from work, cracked open a beer, unknotted my tie, and my phone vibrated. “Jon’s been in an accident…don’t know much else”. Didn’t think too much of it; after all, this was the kid who rolled a 4-wheeler, flipped a snowmobile, and drove his truck into a ditch. I called the hospital where he was taken. The nurse said I should come by. I didn’t need to hear anything else. I knew.

On September 18th, 2012, my best friend, role model, confidant, and Brother was killed in a car accident. The car was driven by a 16 year old that crossed the centerline, clipped my brother’s work truck forcing it to swerve, roll, and eject him. It was 4:42pm and he was leaving a jobsite to go home for the day.

I work with Trusts, Wills, Estates, and retirement planning; never in a million years did I think I’d have to help my Father settle my brother’s Estate.

He’ll never see this e-mail, and he’d curse me up and down for talking about how great of a person he is, what a fantastic role model for my son he is, and how much I miss him. I always leaned on him when things got tough and I often feel lost and worried about living my life without him. But even though he is gone, I will forever carry on his work ethic, his caring, selfless, “give the shirt off your back” attitude. He always had time for others no matter how hectic his life got. I will forever admire that.

February 2014,21,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/02/21/such-different-worlds/,"February 2014, 21",Such different worlds,"Hello Everyone, 

I can't believe I won. I mean, I never won anything in my life until recently. The only thing I won was a discarded medal from my school sports day that no one wanted and my friend thought it would be cool to take it. I still have it until now :) .

Anyhow, I am from Mauritius, a tiny island (48km by 60km) in the middle of the indian ocean. My dad ended up here when there was war in China and my grandparents got onto a boat and hoped that they would reach a better land and they did.

Mauritius is where I was born and after spending 12 years in London, I decided to go back home. I earn one fifth of what I used to earn back in London and I don't regret it at all because Mauritius is a lovely place to live where you have African descendants, Muslims, Indians, white and chinese all living together without killing each other off.

This is also why I thought that I should give the chance for someone else who doesn't have the same luck as I do to pass a quick message about what is happening in her own country which is Ukraine. I believe that everyone should have the chance to live in peace and not fear. 

""Hi, my name is Nastasia,

Usually I have a normal job working in an advertising agency. But times are not normal.

Yesterday more than 70 of my fellow people were shot and killed by the government in Ukraine. 

Shot in the head, shot in the stomach. Blood coloring the cobble stones red at Kyiv's main square, Maidan, where me and my friends have walked, ate ice-cream and danced at festivals over the years.

The government claims that these people were terrorists, yet I know what system they were fighting against. A corrupt, brutal and criminal bunch of thugs making the lives of ordinary citizens unbearable. 

Let me give you some background information if you have the time:

In case you don't know what's happening in Ukraine, google ""what is happening in Ukraine slideshare"" - there's a link on presentation with a summary, last updated 16th Feb. It tells the story about a 3-month-long protest in the center of the country's capital against the criminal president's dictatorship, robbery and total legal vacuum nationwide, all for the sake of president Yanukovich's ""family"" wellbeing (is it normal in your country for a president to have a golden toilet bowl? no, seriously, there are photo proofs). 

This protest was peaceful, but turned violent in November, after riot police shed blood the first time - against the few students who stayed at Maidan at night, singing songs and guarding the tents of protestants on the capital's main square.

Since 16th February (that presentation's last update) we had lots of stuff going on. Government's snipers on roofs of hotels in the center shooting unarmed peaceful protestants, more than 50 people dead, many of them with gunshots - in the head, heart and stomach (obviously bullets aimed to kill, not to stop). The official version is that this was an antiterrorist operation (in a country that never had a terrorist attack?), that the protestants are fascists, nationalist radicals who want to overthrow the legal government. The information war got to an absurd scale. They say, people are drugged and brainwashed. They say, they are financed by Europe and US. Road police stops cars who try to bring food, medicines and supplies for the protesters.

Yesterday by accident I wrote a Facebook post that suddenly got widely shared. Shortly, I joked that if someone doesn't know how to help people at Maidan, I can help with advice. Now, just 2 days later, afetr I got hundreds of messages ""how can I help?"", I manage a 1000 people group on Facebook, coordinating transport, purchase and delivery ofmedical supplies, generators for the field hospitals, etc. People send money without asking who I am or demanding reports on how money were spent. And there are loads of coorinating centers like that. This blind trust and wonderful self-organization make me proud of being a Ukrainian, though I have no Ukrainian blood in my veins (me parents are Russian and Armenian). 

According to the official government's version, though, is that I am a Ukrainian nationalist helping fascists.

Dear world. Please, find and share the news from my country. Help spread the word. Contact your local mass media to cover what's going on. Find NGOs that gather financial help. Make us visible. We work and fight for the freedom we were nominally born with. We want to make our own choices and to manage our own country. During these 3 months we've proven we can do it. The clever way. The kind way. 

And beware - passive political position that allows people like Yanukovich rule countries, break laws and murder the innocent,  can suddenly make you a fascist one day.

Thanks the Listserve team for being understanding and willing to help, thanks Jonathan for letting me use his turn to speak to you, and Jesper, my Danish journalist friend, for helping to write this letter.""

Oh by the way here's Nastasia's email if you would like to contact her:  and mine  .

I walked around, wondering why I couldn't be happy like everybody else.I wondered why I had to get a discharge from the Army, why I couldn't serve my country. 

I wondered why my dad who has money says my doctor appointments were too expensive, but my mom who has no money paid for $500 doctor appointments out of pocket when insurance didn't cover it.

I wondered if it would be easier to kill myself by swallowing pills or by running the car in the garage.

I wouldn't say I'm exactly healthy now, but I don't wonder these things anymore.

Instead, I thank God for my pain. I thank Him for my mom, I thank Him for my church, I thank Him for allowing me to wake up in the morning.  I thank Him for bringing me to my knees so I could realize that some people have it much worse than me.  I thank Him for my amazing girlfriend who taught me that ""when you know, you know.""  I thank Him for teaching me to enjoy the little things in life, because truly that's all we can do.

But right now I thank Him for allowing me to win the ListServe, because I know there's one person out there suffering from pain, feeling like nobody understands, like nobody will listen.

If you're that person, email me.  Or email somebody.  Find somebody who listens, who understands.

For the rest of you, don't be afraid to be different; to think, to feel, to be kind.

My name is Maggie and I'm an English major at Princeton University, currently in my sophomore year. I love writing, photography, traveling, meeting new people and being in the outdoors. I have no idea what I want to do with my life and I'm currently in full exploration. Sometimes it's hard feeling completely lost, especially when so many people are focused on finding that one set path to success -- but recently, I've been learning to trust myself, and it's been a fantastic journey.

2014 has been a great year for me so far. I've been learning how to be more genuine and authentic to who I am, and I've started to search for that same sincerity in other people as well. Instead of being all over the place and restless to meet new people or see new things, I'm beginning to see the value in simply investing in what I have and making more time for who truly matters to me. This has been a beautiful thing.

I want to share several of my favorite quotes with you. Hopefully they're relevant in some way or the other:

“Let yourself be silently drawn by the strange pull of what you really love. It will not lead you astray.” - Rumi

“Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.” - Miyamoto Musashi

""Where you invest your love, you invest your life” - Mumford and Sons

“There may be more beautiful times, but this one is ours.” - Jean-Paul Sartre

“Do not despise your own place and hour. Every place is under the stars, every place is the center of the world.” - John Burroughs

“The more I think it over, the more I feel that there is nothing more truly artistic than to love people.” —Vincent van Gogh

“I’m not sure what I’ll do, but— well, I want to go places and see people. I want my mind to grow. I want to live where things happen on a big scale.” —F. Scott Fitzgerald

“Study nature, love nature, stay close to nature. It will never fail you.” —Frank Lloyd Wright

“You have been criticizing yourself for years, and it hasn’t worked. Try approving of yourself and see what happens.” - Louise Hay

“I beg you, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don’t search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer.”—Rainer Maria Rilke

“Discover why you’re important, then refuse to settle for anyone who doesn’t completely agree.” —Fisher Amelie

“I felt my lungs inflate with the onrush of scenery—air, mountains, trees, people. I thought, “This is what it is to be happy.” - Sylvia Plath

If you ever want to reach out or have other quotes to share, hit me up at  :)Also, if you're ever in the Princeton area and want to grab a meal, let me know as well.

Have a beautiful day,

February 2014,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/02/18/on-kindness-gender-and-moving-to-a-new-city/,"February 2014, 18","On kindness, gender, and moving to a new city.","Hello, world.

My name is Valerie. I'm 19 years old and I live in Ottawa, Canada, but I'm moving to Montréal this summer for school. I work as a cashier at a grocery store. I am a transgender woman. I like good tea and bad coffee. I like waking up slowly to bright skies and frost on my window. I like warm summer nights spent with friends that go on and on, until everyone starts to feel dawn approaching and gets very candid, as if the sun might just not come up again. I like getting lost in cities I've never been to before - or places I thought I knew like the back of my hand until I met someone with a different map.

There's a couple of things I want to ask you to do, followed by questions.

First off I want to implore you to be kind to the people who serve you - your waiters, your dry-cleaners, maybe even your grocery store cashier. We know you're having a bad day. We've met a hundred people today who are having a bad day. Your frustrating ten minutes in line is my eight-hour workday. Practical suggestion: if you had to wait in line a long time, try helping bag your groceries if you can. I'm going to have to deal with that long line all day, but your two minutes' work just saved each person in line two minutes. In general, be proactive about making life slightly easier for the people around you, and you'll start to notice when people do the same for you.

Second, I want to elaborate on an earlier part of my introduction. As I said, I'm transgender. In the last couple of months I've come out to nearly everybody I know, including coworkers and the general public. For some reason I always expected that the most difficult part would be the few horrible people who actively hate me or believe that my gender is illegitimate. I actually haven't met very many of those people at all, thankfully. But what really makes my day difficult isn't the people who want nothing to do with me but the people who just don't notice or care that I'm not a man. Please, look at the person in front of you. Look at their nametag, what they're wearing, the impression they are trying to make on you. Someone in a dress and makeup, even if she has a deep voice, is probably trying to convey to you how she'd like to be seen and treated. You don't have to (please don't) make a big deal out of it. Just, try 'miss' instead of 'bro'. I know I'm the first trans person you've spoken to this week, or in your life. I know it's difficult. But you're the hundredth person I've spoken to today who's in your shoes. I've been told how difficult I am to see as I am ten times today.

Lastly: I am in need of advice myself. If you've moved to Québec from out of the province before, I'd love your wisdom on that process. If you live in Montréal, what is there to do and see and eat? Do you have advice on (re)learning French? What jobs are there for students with a tenuous grasp of the language? How do I avoid pissing off Montréalers? If you're trans, I'd love any advice you have on anything. If you're queer or trans or just think I sound interesting and live in Montréal, feel free to say hi.

Thank you!

When I subscribed to The Listserve, I was immediately afraid to win. I hate writing! I love reading though, so I took the risk of winning the Listserve lottery and subscribed. And now this is happening!

When writing or creating anything I always start to doubt myself. What if people don't like how I write? What if they think I am not creative? And this does not only apply to writing, but also to speeches, improvised acting, dancing, etc. etc.

What makes this kind of funny is the fact that I practice various 'cultural' hobbies. I do theater, dance and I play the piano. And I enjoy it really much, I just never 'create' anything because that makes me feel uncomfortable. 

So now me, this person who hates writing, is supposed to write an email for thousands of people. I decided to ask my friends for help. That's what friends are for, right? I asked them what they would want to say if they could reach 10,000 people. Here are their answers:(I don't think my crazy friends realized I would actually be sending this to 25,000 people, so enjoy! )

- YOLO ;-)

- My mom is the best mom in the whole world!

- Forget about what everyone else thinks ans says. If it makes you happy, do it.

- Thank you all so much for the $100 everybody sent to me.

- Please ladies, not all at the same time!

- Being honest may not get you a lot of friends, but it will always get you the right ones.

- The best things in life aren't things.

- CHANGE THE WORLD!

Thank you for reading this, I hope you enjoyed yourself as much as I do when reading all the beautiful Listserve emails. Good luck in advance for the future winners, I now know what you are going through.

Have a wonderful life!

It was 30 minutes past midnight and I was completely shocked by the talk I had had an hour ago. I spoke with my ex-girlfriend about our future, no matter how weird it sounds.

Three years ago we parted and have not said a single word to each other for all this time. She asked me not to call her, and I have not. A few days ago we met almost by accident, talked for a while, went to the cinema and today had a dinner in a restaurant. As we set down to the table she struck me with the following: ""I have a boyfriend, I am almost married, but I don’t want to be with him. What do you want from me?”.

Wow, to be honest, this was not a talk I was prepared for. We spoke about career plans, immigration, everyday domestic problems, money, children and treason. She has plans, she wants a stable future, but I cannot say I am ready for all that stuff.

And now I have to make one of the most tough decisions in my life for now: do I want to take a new turn in my life?

I've examined the content of all posts to The Listserve since April 2012 - thanks to Simon Weber for the archive! I'm not sure whether this is the beginning - if anyone knows how old The Listserve is, or who is behind it, I'd love to know. Anyway, I spent a couple hours hacking on the dataset with Python, so let me hit you with some SCIENCE FACTS:

First, the average Listserve post has 384 words, and the median has 356. The longest of all time was a 1,950 word rant called ""Volatile Software"" in April, 2012. The shortest of all time was a 2 word post in August 2013, which simply said ""Be kind.""

Here's a list of the top 10 words appearing in the Listserve, and the number of times they've appeared:the: 9215to: 7654i: 6820and: 6742a: 6208of: 5041in: 3720you: 3623that: 3076it: 2795

Well, that's not very interesting. Let's filter it to words that are 4 letters or longer and I'll pick out the top nouns:life: 874people: 788time: 709love: 623there: 591things: 540something: 432world: 400good: 378years: 366

Next I tried to parse the top locations out of the end of the email. There will be a lot that were missed due to formatting (emails that put the location somewhere besides the end, or just formatted the location differently). Here are the top 30 by city:New York: 24San Francisco: 20London: 14Chicago: 12Los Angeles: 11Portland: 10Washington: 9Brooklyn: 9Toronto: 8Seattle: 6Boston: 6Sydney: 5California: 5New Jersey: 4Auckland: 4New York City: 4Cambridge: 4Philadelphia: 4Canada: 3Minneapolis: 3New Orleans: 3Pennsylvania: 3Stockholm: 3Austin: 3Montreal: 3USA: 3Vancouver: 3Baltimore: 3United Kingdom: 3NYC: 3

February 2014,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/02/13/broken-watch/,"February 2014, 13",Broken Watch,"Look at your watch. It’s broken. Do you remember that summer night? A group you weren't part of, a world right next to your own but so different and apart that you couldn't possibly understand how the people inside it worked.

It was late, maybe midnight. You can’t know what time it is now. There was a thunderstorm, and a tornado watch—or a warning? What’s the difference?—and someone suggested a game of capture the flag. It was a stranger. They were all strangers. But you joined them, cast off your rationality for one night of mindlessness, because it felt nice, and because it seemed the thing to do at the time.

What time is it? You don’t know, the watch’s face is blank. All their faces were sort of blank, because they didn't know much, just the safe little world they’d grown up in, with themselves and no one else. No one strayed, no one questioned, no one forced truths upon them and made them see that the world was big, and not always comfortable.

You are sitting uncomfortably because you don’t know how long you've been sitting, or how much longer you’ll be required to. It’s not the sitting itself that’s uncomfortable; it’s the not knowing.

You've always been uncomfortable with any lack of knowledge. That’s why they were such a wonder to you. They were satisfied with ignorance, and though it made you angry, you envied them. They could come home and run around in the rain and laugh and drink, and wake up the next morning and kiss their mothers goodbye and get on a plane to some distant desert and stalk the day with a gun in their hands and a fire in their hearts. They could do it all and know that they were protected, even in death, by something greater than themselves. You envied them because they knew a love you had never known, and you were sure it didn't exist but that didn't make it feel any less absent. You always find yourself burdened by absences, whether it’s the absence of faith or of the time of day.

You sit here wondering what time it is. Maybe that knowledge would give you relief, or at least answer some of your questions, Yet you also sort of wish that you’d never had a concept of time at all, because then you wouldn't worry that you were missing something. Is a hole that’s never been filled really a hole? If a watch didn't work in the first place, can you still call it broken? And you begin to realize that maybe this crisis is about more than just a broken watch.

I thought this was an asinine suggestion, but when I pressed further, he simply shrugged and repeated it. After thinking about this for a while, I thought; what is important? What does everyone have in common in here? What should I cover? Everything. Everything that ever was and ever will be. Everything that everyone thinks, feels, sees, or hears. All of these things is but a fraction of everything that actually is. A small fraction in our corner of the universe. Everything is important is a drop in the bucket of everything, and that perhaps makes our everything special. Everything is our home, it's the place that we have, for better or worse, chosen to share...""

When I asked my boyfriend what I should write for the listserve, he wrote to me the above.I liked it so much, I decided it was a an excellent idea to share. I guess that means he's on the listserve now too.

My own thoughts about everything... It is exactly what I thought it would be. In fact, Lauryn Hill tells us, ""everything is everything."" And she's not wrong.

So I guess the moral of the story is kids, if life has you down, remember that everything is everything.

Unrelated, but equally important: I've been looking forward to the chance to write on the listserve and like everyone else, I didn't know what to write. I originally had this rather narcissistic beginning, until I realized just how narcissistic... Yeah, that got deleted pretty quickly.

I wish you all less trouble deciding when your time comes. I wish you all the best of luck with all that you endeavor. And most importantly, I wish for you to have strength and durability in all that you do.

1. I went to a bathroom stall and found a small whiteboard on the back of the stall door, with a magnetic dry erase marker attached to it. This was to mitigate the problem of bathroom graffiti by allowing people who feel the need to express themselves to do so in a way that is considered socially acceptable.2. Someone had directly scratched into the whiteboard in order to vandalize it. 

I think I had a good day today, but I try not to think about that. Just because I feel good doesn't mean that I'm doing the healthiest steps to handle my depression. The reverse applies too; I can have a productive and exciting day and still feel like shit the entire time. But one of these is better than the other, for me at least. 

Overload this with salt, as you should probably only take advice from people you want to end up like. I try not to think about results whenever presented with things I can't control, so that my actions are more important than the actual outcome. For instance, in a poker game, there's always an element of variability. You can make a play that a hundred professionals would do, and still lose to some statistical anomaly when it comes time to reveal. The most important thing is that all 101 of you still played correctly. 

My mood is sporadic, sometimes manic, and maybe its own entity, so it's extremely hard to figure out what's working or not. I just have to keep incorporating as many processes from what I've learned that will help as much possible. And it's all very personal to me, I want to figure it out myself, as hypocritical as it is to give you a huge gaping hint. (and if you're like me, and get angry when people tell you tips you already know, I'm sorry. I tell myself that they only mean the best. (I'm sorry again.))

It's probably because that's the best part- figuring out how to conduct yourself, learning what creates happiness for you and those around you, and like it's all one giant puzzle. Admittedly, I've noticed I laugh a lot more now, probably because I've spent so much time creating lens to view things in hilarious ways for myself. 

The reason that I thought today was a good day was because I woke up in the morning on time and went to a photoshoot where I was able to comfortably crossdress and wear makeup in front of people I knew. Then at work I created two posters that my clients were satisfied with. Then I helped out with an event in which I had volunteered doing the MCing for, and bombed awkwardly in front of a full house- but found myself thankful for the resilience I've built from the experience of being on stage. Then I went home, jerked off, and then wrote this listserve email twice because I wrote the first one in a word count website that doesn't save text when you accidentally go back a page. Plus, my mood is okay for now, which I appreciate. 

That said, I really hope that this email doesn't come off as some story with a happy ending about how I got better because of some oversimplified idea I have. I'm still doing fucking terrible. Happy endings are only sad stories that you don't know the endings to, anyway. 

Then again, a scratch on a white board still prevents a scratch on the bathroom stall.

Almost like a coincidence, I am today in the process of writing a list of my life rules, in order to achieve all my goals and become the person I want to be, and suddenly an email from the Listserve arrives to my inbox, like sent from heaven!.

My name is Javier Sanchez and I´m from Mexico City. I´m 26 and I work as an auditor in a Copper Mining Corporation. I love to work out at the gym, read LOTS of books and walk my dog.

But who really I am on the inside? I am a dreamer, a goal setter, a go-getter; so that is what occupies my mind all day, everyday. Stuff like: ¿How to become the perfect version of myself? ¿How to achieve the life I wish for? ¿How to lead, inspire, and help the people? I´m craving to know the whole world, and as a secret between us, my BIGGEST dream is to live someday in NY, but I still don't have a plan for achieving that u_u.Such kind of things are my life quest.

I was reading the other day ""The Great Gatsby"" (which you should read if you haven't because its awesome!) and there is a part at the end of the book (no spoilers) where we learn which were the life rules of Gatsby because he knew from a very young age that he was meant for greatness.

So I decided today that I was going to start my own life rules, and so far they go like this:

1.- THE FIRST RULE IS THAT DON'T EVEN ME CAN BREAK A RULE.2.- FIRST THINGS ALWAYS COMES FIRST.3.- I sleep and wake up everyday at the same hour. At 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.4.- I work out everyday at 6 a.m. at the gym, except for weekends which I only run.5.- No fat foods ever. That includes sugar (like sodas) or any fried food.6.- Sundays are for cleaning the house, buy the grocery and preparing my clothes for the week.7.- I´m a person of integrity and I live according to my values and principles. Some of they are: I never lie and I never take anything that doesn't belongs to me.8.- I´m punctual to any meeting, and I do mean ANY meeting.9.- I take care of my image a lot. That includes my hygiene, clothes, posture, smell, breath and calligraphy.10.- I'm a gentlemen, in my way of talking and treating everyone.11.- No one is allowed to treat me bad. Also I'm nowhere allowed to treat bad anyone.12.- I´m 100% self confident.13.- I´m never afraid to talk to anyone, nor to express my ideas (if they don't harm in anyway to any one).14.- I never, and I do mean EVER will get drunk again (because I´ve done it and its the stupidest thing ever).15.- I read everyday. My goal is to read 5 books a month.

That´s how far I´ve got. ¿What do you think about it? ¿Do you have any life rules?

I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO SPEAK, WRITE AND KNOW YOU. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE ARE YOU FROM OR EVEN YOUR AGE. AS I´VE SAID BEFORE ONE OF MY BIGGEST GOALS IS TO KNOW THE WORLD, AND THAT INCLUDES ITS PEOPLE.

Before finishing I will recommend two books to you. This are the ones that have literally changed my life and will surely change yours:The 4 agreements - Dr. Miguel Ruiz.The Laws of Success - Napoleon Hill

So I'm actually American but I'm currently studying abroad in Ireland for a semester.  I'm from Ashland, Oregon, where we have a really amazing Shakespeare festival (you should all come).  In college, I'm studying comparative/international politics.  I'm kind of obsessed with travel.  So if you have any recommendations for unusual but awesome places to visit, by all means let me know. I also like reading, baking, doing puzzles (of all kinds), walking, writing poetry, and other activities that I can't think of right now. 

I've also kind of abandoned my plans for the future.  I haven't given up on my future or anything of that sort.  Rather, I have just accepted that I'll probably end up bouncing around between locations/careers/goals because I'm easily swayed by chance.  If you have any ideas of awesome jobs that involve travel, let me know!

Since I haven't come up with a cohesive idea of what to say, I'm just going to list some random thoughts that have popped into my mind over the last 48 hours.

If you are ever traveling in Jerusalem on a Friday evening you should go to the wailing wall at sundown and after the prayers look around for a random rabbi who is shouting orders at a crowd of confused looking young people.  If you do this, you will hopefully be assigned to go to a wonderful shabbat dinner with a really nice Jewish family for free.  It's awesome!  

If you live or are traveling in Dublin, we should get coffee!  (or if you're in Ashland, Oregon at some point in the future).  

Real eyes realize real lies. (I didn't think of this)

I just heard an NPR piece about a Swiss company called Algordanza that makes diamonds out of the ashes from a cremation.  Kind of creepy.  Kind of cool.  In a way, it's a beautiful idea.

Anyway, good luck with life!

Anyway.I'm a 22 year old Geology Student in Vienna, Austria.All I want to say about Geology is this: We don't just study 'boring' rocks,what's really fascinating is getting the big picture about everything on this earth, understanding how almost everything is connected.

What i really want to talk about is this:I love good books, i really do! So some time ago i came to the conclusion that i should read more.What I did was to try if I could read one book per week for a year. No matter how thick, just one book per week.(I also kept a list and wrote down how many pages I had read, just to see how much it would be in average) So I ended this last year with book number 58.And I'm continuing in this year with a new list.The interesting thing is this: Once i got used to reading a lot, you wouldn't want to stop.I read somewhere that people who don't read live just one life, while readers can live as many lives as they want in their books. Of course, you can't take that literally, but it has a very nice ring to it. And maybe even a bit of Truth?!

I will leave you with this: If you enjoy to read, make time for it. If you're really motivated you can try one book/week and see if you beat me.If I should recommend one book to anyone, and it couldn't be more than one, it's this:Khalil Gibran – The ProphetEven if you have only very little time, please try to find it and read it (It's only about 100 pages long).In my opinion, Khalil Gibran was not just a wise man, but rather something closer to a genius. A genius with a poet's soul, maybe?

Shout outs:Samuel: for introducing me to the listserve!Flo: for enjoying bad puns and joining the listserve on my advice ;)

To the rest of you: Greeting from Austria!Feel free to write me!Tell me what you think about 'The Prophet', or recommend some good books to me, or just write me for the sake of it :)

My life changed drastically in the last 72 hours, including this email. So, if I may, let me ask for a bit of help.

Here's my story. I am a 22 year old graduate of MIT from Scarsdale, NY. In 6 weeks I am supposed to leave for the Army Special Forces selection and training. It's been quite the curious road, initially declining service academies and attending MIT, then spurning more ""traditional"" occupations to enlist. I have spent months with family and friends trying to help them understand and cope with my decision. However, 16 hours before being told it was ""my turn"" to speak to all of you, I was informed that my application was placed on hold because my vision (I'm colorblind) wouldn't pass muster. It got me to quite a bit of thinking - I wanted to enlist to serve and help those in need in a direct manner. For those of you who find this incongruous, I urge you to look up what Green Berets actually do, look up unconventional warfare, and recalibrate from your visions of Rambo.

Aside from the discipline, camaraderie and everything else I sought out from service, I (admittedly, and somewhat proudly) naively believe that individuals who wish to serve must do so in both direct and indirect ways. Basically, don't just do hands on work like Habitat in more individualistic settings and forget about larger scale movements like grassroots campaigns and supporting larger causes. The converse holds true as well - don't stay large-scale without getting your hands dirty. My decision to serve as a Green Beret went to helping serve those in need currently under the yoke of oppression and without freedoms. I wished to dedicate a legal career after my service to the more large-scale.

Given the hold-up in my enlistment,  I have been forced to now at least consider other opportunities while I wait to hear back, be it in the service or outside of it. As such, here's where I would greatly appreciate the advice and the help:

The more information about unique programs and opportunities to get my hands dirty, the better. Sure, everyone and their mother has heard of Teach for America or the Peace Corps. Those and many other famous programs are fantastic and I wholeheartedly endorse them and all of those who take part as people who, like me, are just trying to help make a difference and pay it forward.

But what are some of the ""deep cut"" type of programs, great things that deserve to be more widespread and have more participants. Especially pending my application's review, I may not be able to pursue my military career (at least not in Special Forces) and as such may ultimately choose to participate in those to fulfill my internal compulsion to do some good hands-on work.That said, to hear a bit more about me, Special Forces, and why I choose that route over any other, ping me. I'd love to talk about it and hear all thoughts and advice.

Other quick hits:

1) Shoutouts to Jack Wanderman, also MIT '13, for getting me hooked on listserve, and Crosby Steiner for helping me find my words.

2) Whenever you want to get to know someone, particularly a mentor, there are three questions you really should ask:

a) What's your favorite book?b) What's your favorite novel?c) If you weren't doing what you were doing, what would you do instead?

3) To stay humble and motivated, consider the following:

No matter what you are doing in life, you were not the strongest or smartest or best positioned, but neither were you the weakest or dumbest or worst positioned. Always remember that whenever you hit either extreme highs or extreme lows to keep you even keel and humming.

Sometimes in our lives, we are given a little extra time with ourselves. A time to think or reflect. For me, that time is the 45 minute drive back from my girlfriend’s house. The empty roads and dark night combine with the hypnotic beat of Tiesto, or whatever CD I have in, to create the perfect atmosphere for thinking about whatever pops into my head.

I recall one such night that stands out in my mind, I was driving home on the virtually vacant highway under the vast night sky, the beat pounding in the background, and I started to feel small. There I was, alone, insignificant, flying towards home in a little metal box across my little piece of our grand earth’s surface. It was a kind of solemn feeling, a little sad.

But then, someone passed me. Another person, driving a small black SUV, passed me on that otherwise empty highway, and everything changed. Who is this person? Why are they out driving so late? I don't know them. I wonder if they notice me.

I wonder what stories they could tell me.

There they were, busy living a life, full of stories, and for a brief moment, we were alone, together. Every human being is full of stories. In our little heads, we hold histories of our little chunk of this world. And when someone dies, in most cases, those stories go away. Each person is a treasure trove of anecdotes, captured for only a fleeting moment. That makes every death incredibly tragic, and every late night conversation, every stranger met, and every moment shared immeasurably valuable. And at that moment, I felt significant. I felt blessed to be alive, to be in a state where I can share and hear stories.

If you're reading this, you're also blessed. There are stories all around you. Find them. Call your mom, or ask your grandparents what life was like for them. Make it a point to meet a stranger. And if you're so inclined, take a moment to send me a story from your life. It doesn't have to be anything major, the little moments can be as valuable as the big. I'd love to hear from you.

You're alive. Go find a story. Go make a story. They're all around you.

the great thing about listserve is that it is based on such a simple idea. I enjoy this random-based, non-hierarchical way of interchange since half a year. Searching for simple ideas, for the idea that suggest itself, is what occupies me most as an conceptual urban artist. 

One day I entered an art school out of curiosity, smelled its atmosphere and knew what I want in life!  That was 25 years ago and since then I got so many chances to develop and refine my artistic practice and have been able to travel the world with my partner as an artist couple for all kind of projects. 

To me, art is all about dealing with freedom. To pick whatever is interesting or unsettled, to research on it and to create a comment through this vast variety of media available nowadays. I wish that everyone who feels the desire to express and to create finds the courage and the means do so. To succeed and to fail and to start over again. And I am convinced that cultural exchange is a superb contribution to foster mutual understanding on this shaken planet. 

Try to appreciate art. Go for the weird things, the works that disturb or provoke you and learn more about their background. Talk to the artists and ask them about their motivation. The art system might be difficult to grasp but every now and then one finds that touching piece which opens up a unique and unseen view of the world.

Art is love. Love art! Truely, Stephan

Considering I rarely get out of my routine, our neighborhood…rarely meet new people, I can’t stop smiling from the idea that I am communicating with nearly 25,000 people (if all read this).  So here goes…

I come from a family where most relatives in my generation have sloughed off the dysfunctional aspects of life in which we were raised.  Me? Racism is non-existent in my heart and behavior. I replaced the word never with more hopeful vocabulary because experience has shown me that hope, like enthusiasm, is sticky. So I touch everyone and everything and leave hopeful enthusiasm everywhere! Some of the most powerful words I own are YET! WHY NOT? and IF…

From the age of eight I knew that I wanted to teach. School was always our first play choice. When the weather was warm my sister, Donna, and I would hang blankets from trees to create walls. She pretended she ran the school…I pretended that EVERYONE, like me, LOVED learning. Hahahaha

Scratch that, and fast forward to 2014 where my goal now is not merely to teach and foster a love of literature and language, but to make a difference in a community where poverty robs kids of their dreams and gunfire is what happens outside, so most kids don’t play under the trees like I did.  Increasingly for too many of my students, school is a place to socialize, eat (“meals” with conversation at home are rare), feel safe, and have access to technology.

I am awed, entertained, and educated every day by something technology brings into my life (like this Listserve). My teaching partner calls me the Wizard. But, it’s not magic. Technology is a way of life, so I do my best to find digital tools that are current, useful, and challenging and embed them into our learning practices. Technology is the only proof I need to show kids that do-overs are an essential part of life.

Music is another love that I pass on to students. My classroom walls are lined with vinyl album covers of bands they all come to know through what I call, Lyrics to Live By. Some quotes that generate hearty discussions:•       “If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.” -Rush, Freewill•       “If you can judge a wise man by the color of his skin, Then mister you’re a better man than I.” -Aerosmith, Livin’ on the Edge•       So often in time it happens, we all live our life in chains, and we never even know we have the key. -The Eagles, Already Gone

I know I’m not the easiest teacher. It’s a hate/love relationship we develop; kids hate the way I push, but eventually love the way I NEVER GIVE UP….and that’s what ensures, in spite of the fact that reading and writing are HARD (because learning became the least important thing on their plate years ago), kids show up every day and TRY something new…some even end up learning to love the power of words.  I call that a win/win!

What would I like from my Listserve readers? I would like to know what words and literature you find powerful. What lyrics do you live by? (I love adding to my music collection). Write me and follow me, @Poeteacher on Twitter.  Help me grow my Personal Learning Network. Teach me something new I can pass on to my kids @Calumet New Tech, the best kids in the world! (well, at least, my world). And let’s share strategies for how to make a difference!

I have realized over the past few months that this attempt to make everyone happy is not only hurting myself but with the people I interact with.

Some may say ""Hey, being a nice guy is not bad and you will get what you want in the end.""  However,  I find that it isn’t necessarily the act of being “nice” that makes you a nice guy.  It is how we treat life and what we expect.  Our act of being nice to people and our obsession with pleasing people causes us to expect the same in return.  If we do not get it, we put ourselves down for feeling we didn’t get what we deserved.  Whether we are with a group of friend or with our spouse, we do things that will give us more credibility and prevent ourselves from doing anything that may subtract value from us.

Part of this requires more empathy towards others rather than sympathy.  We should fit ourselves more into others shoes rather than having them fit into ours.  When we do things for others, we should do them for the innate good of the person.  Now that can sometimes be tricky as doing something for others can always be good for them.  It is also the avoidance of thinking that one day the favor will be returned to you.

Overall,  I realize that being nice isn’t everything.  It is this realization that we may be seeking too much approval from being nice and instead, living our lives to our own degree and helping our friends along the way.

Plain and simple. I laughed and told her she was ridiculous - but when I thought about it a little bit, she had a good point.

I've always been a rule follower. My mom likes to remind me of when I was little and at a friend's birthday party, the friend's mom had given the partygoers little goody bags to bring into the movie theater instead of paying for popcorn. I was the worst child in the world and started shouting in the lobby of the theater that we're not allowed to bring in outside snacks. Oops.

Most recently, my family and I got flu shots at Walgreens and the pharmacist told us we had to wait 10 minutes after the shots before leaving. As my parents stood up to leave, I reminded them that we had to stay for 10 minutes like the lady said. I got weird stares from my parents, which was my cue that I was being a stickler for the rules again.

So yeah - I don't break rules. I'm not usually aware of when I'm doing my rule-following and should probably have someone with a little buzzer following me around reminding me to live a little.

So, good people of the Listserve, I tell you this because 1. having 25,000+ people aware of my lame-ness will hopefully inspire me to do something about it and 2. I want you to think about when you play by the rules instead of just living your life like you want to. Or... maybe it's just me.

On an unrelated note, I'm graduating college in May and would love to chat with you about entry-level jobs you may be aware of in the communications field in New York City. I promise that, despite this long email telling you that I'm lame, I'm actually a fun person. I promise.

January 2014,27,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/01/27/rational-numbers-and-the-square-root-of-2/,"January 2014, 27",Rational Numbers and the Square Root of 2,"I am a mathematician. Please allow me to share with some mathematics which I have found to be both enduringly fascinating and very accessible: I present a discussion on rational numbers and the square root of 2.  

Rational numbers---or just rationals---are the result of dividing one integer by another. Examples are 1/2, -1/5, and 23/11; perhaps less obvious examples are 1, 2, and 3, as you can always write 1 = 1/1, 2 = 2/1, and 3 = 3/1. Essentially, rationals are all the numbers that can be written as a fraction.  

Generally, we write rationals in reduced or simplest form. 2/4, for example, can be simplified by dividing the top and bottom of the fraction by 2; thus 2/4 = 1/2. Notice that in reduced form, the top and bottom numbers cannot both be even. If they were, just as in the example of 2/4, you could cancel out the common factor of 2 to find a more-reduced form. 

Any rational can always be written in reduced form.  Rationals have a pleasing property: any basic arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) on two rationals always yields another rational. But is there any operation which might give a different kind of number?  Consider multiplying a rational by itself, or squaring. 2 squared is 4. We might reverse this statement and ask the following: what number squared equals 4? This question defines the square root; the square root of 4 is 2. But what about the square root of 2 itself? Is there any rational which is the square root of 2?  

Now we reach the heart of the matter. In fact, no rational could be the square root of 2. To see why, we consider what would happen if it were.  

What if the square root of 2 were rational? Then there must be two integers---let's call them p and q---such that ""the square root of 2 = the reduced fraction p/q"". Equivalently, we can say that ""q times the square root of 2 = p"". If we square this statement, we say that ""q squared times 2 equals p squared"".  

From this last statement, we note something interesting: p squared must be even. Actually---as an odd number squared is odd---p itself must be even. What does this imply about q?  If p is even, then p must equal 2 times something; let's say that ""p = 2 times n"". Then our statement ""q squared times 2 = p squared"" can also be written as ""q squared times 2 = 4 times n squared"". If we divide this equation by 2, we may state that ""q squared = 2 times n squared"". This statement is familiar. Just as above, we infer that q squared, and thus q, is even.  

But now we have found something quite troubling: if the square root of 2 were rational and equaled p/q, then both p and q must be even. If both p and q are even, however, then p/q cannot be a reduced fraction. Since every rational can be written as a reduced fraction, the square root of 2 cannot be a rational number.  

Of course, we might wonder what sort of number the square root of 2 is, if it is not rational. This question leads to the irrational numbers. Other questions that could be asked lead to other sorts of numbers such as imaginary numbers, transcendental numbers, quaternions, and the list goes on. This, to me, encapsulates the enduring fascination of mathematics: good questions are always rewarded.

It is why I joined TheListserve and have been inspired by the voices that come across in most the emails.  People want to connect. The Listserve is a prime example of this driving force in who we are.

It is also why for the bulk of my life, I’ve been dedicated to finding ways to connect people, including bringing movements of people together to create change.  Today,  I am the lucky random name, able to send you a message as part of the  listserve experiment and I want to see if we can do something together.

One of the most impactful projects I’ve worked on is PreventObesity.net, an online network of about 3,500 advocacy leaders and more than 300,000 grassroots supporters who are dedicated to taking action to reverse childhood obesity.And right now, PreventObesity.net is running an advocacy campaign I’m really passionate about.  I am curious to see if thelistserve readers want even more ways to work together.

Somewhere between 25 and 30 million Americans cannot access healthy, affordable food within a reasonable distance of their home. You might have heard of these communities referred to as “food deserts,” since it is nearly impossible for residents to find nutritious food there. Some advocates like to call them “food swamps,” as that phrase reflects the high number of fast food establishments and corner markets selling unhealthy processed goods in these communities.

Whatever your preferred term is, the lack of healthy food access in these neighborhoods is one of the things driving our country’s obesity epidemic. More than two-thirds of Americans are now overweight or obese, which is negatively impacting their health and contributing to rising healthcare costs.

Research shows you are WHERE you eat, and the neighborhood you live in can have a profound impact on your food choices. Simply put, how can we expect families to eat healthy food if they can’t even buy that food in their own neighborhood?

Unfortunately, research also shows that a whole lot of people are not aware of this problem. It’s a tough one to grasp, especially for people like myself who are fortunate to be surrounded by grocery stores and other healthy retail options where I live.

That’s why PreventObesity.net recently launched the Healthy Food Access Quiz. It’s designed to spread the word about the importance of healthy, affordable food access in America, showcase some of the negative things that happen when people live in food deserts and outline a handful of solutions to this complicated problem.

For example, do you know how many Americans do not own a vehicle and live more than one mile from a supermarket? Or how low-income neighborhoods, communities of color and rural areas are more likely to be able to access healthy, affordable food? Or how many jobs are created when a large food retailer like a grocery store opens in a food desert?

I encourage you to take the Healthy Food Access Quiz and put your knowledge to the test. (You can find it on the blog on the PreventObesity.net homepage.) Please also share the quiz with your friends, family and colleagues!

Increasing healthy food access to all Americans isn’t the only thing we must do to reverse obesity and build a healthier country. But it is a good starting point. If we can ensure all Americans can find healthy, affordable food near their home, we can focus our attention on the other problems driving the epidemic.

What would I write about that anyone would want to hear? I'm not a big fan of ""rules to live by"" or ""what I've learned"" kind of stories.  I am quite a bit older than many of you. I am sometimes technically-challenged when it comes modern devices, although I love my tablet and would give up my TV in a heartbeat rather than my computer. What interests me? I love books and music, and I live surrounded by them. Every room in my house has a book-case and they're all full. Regular culling, although painful, is a necessity. Although I own an E-reader, I just cannot adjust to using it. The feel, look and heft of a book means so much to me. If I go into someone's house and there are no books lying around, it feels sterile and empty. I couldn't imagine living there. I am always accepting recommendations for the next book. The same goes for music. I have an MP3 player, and like the convenience, but to my mind one of the joys of opening up a new CD is the liner notes, the list of credits, the photos. I'm a music geek, as interested in the back-up musicians and producers as I am in the artist. I own hundreds of CDs that cover every genre from country music to classical, and look forward to my daily notices from Amazon about what's happening this week. When a new album comes out, I love to find the hidden gem that might otherwise never reach my ears. I thank the CBC every day for introducing me to new artists. That's about all I can offer you in 600 words. There is one rule I would offer, in spite of what I said in my first paragraph: Trust your instincts. If something feels wrong, it almost assuredly is. This is much truer than its opposite. If something feels right, it isn't necessarily so. Think twice.

I don't really have any advice for you (I can almost hear a thousand sighs of relief) so I'll share a story instead.

When I was 26, I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and it was bad. Tumours everywhere – seriously everywhere.  I was admitted to University College Hospital in London for which I am forever grateful.  The medical staff were all amazing and knowledgeable and kind and thoughtful. If you ever get a blood disease, I would totally recommend UCH.  I'd rate it on Tripadvisor but there's no section for near death experiences.

But long story short(ish) – chemo started immediately which started to shrink my tumours including the one in my heart.  Which was now hanging on by a thread.  To minimise the risk of it detaching, my cardiologist (who had the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen) decided that heart surgery was the answer.  Not exactly the news I was hoping for but if you have to hear that your chest is going to be sliced open, you might as well hear it from a man with inch long eyelashes.

But I digress.  So, in the surgery, something went wrong and they couldn't put me on bypass. My surgeon was a bit of a maverick who wasn’t going to be stopped by something as silly as the circulation of oxygen (?!?!) so he decided it would be a great idea to stop my heart, pack my head with ice to preserve my brain cells and take the tumour out as quickly as possible.

Which meant that I WAS DEAD.  For around 45 minutes.  Now, I know you're all wondering if I saw a light ...  but to be honest, I don't remember.  It was dark. I was heavily sedated.  But I don't think that River Phoenix was there to greet me with a tequila slammer and a basket of kittens.  What? You have your version of heaven and I have mine.

Kind of anti-climatic ending to that story isn't it? (you only get 600 words on here, kids) But the upshot is, the surgery & 6 months of chemo & a stem cell transplant worked!  I've recovered (11 years clear this year) and I've learned...

1) I‘m so lucky to live in a country where I didn’t have to pay for excellent & comprehensive health care.  If I had had to pay for even a fraction of what my treatment cost, I would be destitute. So thanks NHS - and leave it alone you stupid Tory government.2) Always get a second opinion.  I must have had cancer for over a year before I was finally diagnosed at stage 4.  I went to my GP who convinced me that the lumps in my neck & my back were nothing serious & I should take antibiotics.  I trusted her.  I shouldn't have.  If you think something is wrong & your doctor thinks you're making too big a deal out of it, get a new doctor.3) My friends saved me.  Without them & their non-stop love and devotion, I’m almost positive I wouldn’t have made it.  They are the greatest.4) Be nice to your nurses.  Try not to barf on them.  They hate that.5) Even in the bleakest times, try to find something to laugh about because it helps get through the day and your immune system really likes the endorphins from a good old belly laugh.

Oops – looks like I’ve managed to slip in a bit of advice in anyway.   Sorry.  Thanks for reading and don’t forget that if you find a lump somewhere, GO GET IT CHECKED OUT IMMEDIATELY YOU NERDS!

To conclude, here is my favorite poem by e. e. cummings.

anyone lived in a pretty how town(with up so floating many bells down)spring summer autumn winterhe sang his didn't he danced his did

Women and men(both little and small)cared for anyone not at allthey sowed their isn't they reaped their samesun moon stars rain

children guessed(but only a fewand down they forgot as up they grewautumn winter spring summer)that noone loved him more by more

someones married their everyoneslaughed their cryings and did their dance(sleep wake hope and then)theysaid their nevers they slept their dream

one day anyone died i guess(and noone stooped to kiss his face)busy folk buried them side by sidelittle by little and was by was

January 2014,21,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/01/21/life-as-i-know-it/,"January 2014, 21",Life as I know it,"Hi there.  Every day I read the listserve and I ponder what it is I would say.  And here I am, still wondering.  I’m 42, I have 3 sons 21, 19, and 17.  I live with my love and my two cats in a home we just bought in Oregon City.  We just moved in November and then December 20 I got the flu and haven’t fully bounced back yet, so I feel like our new life, the one starting with buying a home, has not quite started yet.

A little about me.  In my life I’ve been a photographer, a grief coach, an empowerment coach, I’m a published author (my first fiction will be out in 2014 and I’m so excited!).  I’ve published guided journals, a photography book, and a book of poetry so far.  I can honestly say though, that this novel has been my life’s work and that writing a novel is like walking up a very tall mountain.  It’s hard, it’s challenging, and you ponder giving up more than once.

I currently am the Social Media director for an SEO company but am working on moving into freelance social media.  I just don’t feel like it’s best for me to work for “the man” you know?

So, what words of wisdom could I possibly have?  I have a few core beliefs.  I believe that at any point, any of us could pass the point of no return.  Like Susan Smith when she sent her car into that lake with her children on it.  Who’s to say that couldn’t have been one of us snapping?  I try to think compassionately towards people who pass that point of no return.  Look what they have to live with for the rest of their lives.  I can’t fathom their pain, and I don’t feel a right to judge or add to it.  My personal perspective, and perhaps yours differs.  Another of my beliefs is that this world is big enough for all of our views on things.

I can be sarcastic, and a bit snarky, but I don’t ever set out to hurt others.  In fact, I don’t understand when others shoot their venom on others.  I know a few people who do this and I always retreat, I just have no understanding of the desire to hurt others.

Goals for the year are on my mind.  I no longer do resolutions, but I do pick a word of the year to state my intent and this year that word is Community.  I’ve been a bit reclusive in the past but it’s time for me to participate.  Time for me to join in my new community of Oregon City, and time for me to enjoy the global community I’m a part of.  Any suggestions or input on that would be welcome.

Also, I’m interested in survival/homesteading.  I will be growing a garden for the first time ever this year and welcome all tips there too.  I welcome suggestions on ways to keep the food too.  Canning, dehydrating, freezing, etc.  I want to do it all.  Self sufficiency seems to be the way to go.

If you have ideas on freelancing or suggestions, please contact me with those as well.  If you want to know more about me or have questions about anything I’ve said, I’m happy to have the conversation.  Finally, my favorite quote:  “Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least.” ~Goethe

I look forward to hearing from you.

January 2014,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/01/19/a-simple-rant/,"January 2014, 19",A Simple Rant,"As a citizen of the world, I get sad from what I see everyday. The biggest fight we have right now, it is definitely ignorance. In the age of (almost) free information, that we have to battle ignorance.  This is not funny, because it is a degenerative condition.  It is now on almost all layers of society. On western societies it seems to be mostly omnipresent.Self-interest and emotional intelligence, working together, and without the walking cane of knowledge to help them move forward reminds me of an old saying long forgotten:

""Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind.""

People in the last 30 years have slowly changed the natural contracts that exist between us. From parent to child, between lovers , friends or business partners. Things are now heading other ways. The same problem is being solved differently to arrive to different solutions. Its ok. It works anyway. The rant isn't heading that way, diversity is cool, if it remains tolerant.

The rant is heading  to the different Leviathans that  are just working in their self-interest using emotions as a guide. Modern democracies are just a reflex of the base that supports them.  All of the pillars that compose a modern western society are just off. This isn't a monetary crisis,  economic or financial one. And it will last as long as it takes for the Leviathans to adapt to the new natural contracts between people that are being signed on every moment in western countries. Once those pillars like the executive, legislative and the judicial become barely useful, that means the door is rotten and it is ready to be kicked in. As I see it, right now, the first two are inconsequential at best. The executive branch, generally speaking, have problems in their hands  beyond their intellectual capability and the legislative branch excel in making boiling pots that don't apply to real life, to the natural contracts between people. The judicial branch on western societies, it is still blipping, but its decadence is obvious albeit slow paced. I could talk more on this, but it wouldn't be a simple rant anymore.

A shift is coming, and it will come slowly. As a citizen of the world, with friends scattered around the world, I see that what comes out off the Fourth Estate or Power, it is so out of touch, that half of it is propaganda and the other half it is just plain useless. The same apply to how governments, business and people see themselves. Statistics of course. Macroeconomic magnitudes if you prefer to call them that way.

There is a low pitched humming going on, and it is everywhere. Small things that catches your eye. So many, you cannot ignore it anymore.

I don't know where things are headed, there are too many scenarios. This is indeed the Age of Uncertainty. One thing I do know. Regardless of what will happen to currencies, political borders, societies or ideologies, there is just one safe haven.

It is you. The value of self. Things like, how fast you can learn, what can you do with what you learned, how can you adapt. Things like that. If you can make the right question before giving an answer. If can find and use the correct tool, to solve the correct problem. And how much time you need to do all that.

This could go on, and on, but this medium has a logical limit. I wish Godspeed to all of you, and have fun. Thanks for reading to a simple rant.

We rip off each other's clothing and the foreplay continued, but something started to feel wrong. Shivers were sent down my spine and goosebumps lined my body. And then I looked down. She did too.

January 2014,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/01/16/the-power-of-touch/,"January 2014, 16",The Power of Touch,"Hello you all.

I often see myself being a bit rude when talking. Perhaps is my lack of ability in actually talk directly to someone for more then 5 minutes without forcing myself to think I'm annoying the other person, or maybe it's just this is simply a hard thing for me to do. Don't get me wrong, I'm not that introverted. Give me a bottle of wine and I will be the funniest guy around. But in normal conditions, verbal communication face to face tuns into a big challenge. It's a lot of insecurity and low self-esteem and I'm aware of that, but right now, there's nothing I want to change. Conformity is also something to be beaten.

But the bad side of it is not what I want to talk about. I want to talk about what I've learned by not being able to hold a conversation that requires emotional levels.

There are times - during intense grief or fear, but also in ecstatic moments of joy or love - when only the language of touch can fully express what we feel. Verbal language the way we know it, it's just not enough. There are no words that can comfort or express a feeling more then a touch.

A high-five.A hug.A kiss.A slap.A punch.Holding your own hands in a pray act.A hair stroke.Well.. countless kinds of touch for countless feelings.

Thinking about it and realizing that actually I am a touchy person when I'm just too afraid and insecure to use words, made me create a video. This video is an invitation for people to relearn the power of touch. There's much to be gained from embracing our tactile sense - in particular, more positive interactions and a deeper sense of connection with others. 

If you want to check it, just google ""The Power of Touch"" by Juarez Rodrigues. I'm not a filmmaker but I felt like sharing my thoughts to the world.

What about you? Have you touched someone today? :)

Feel free to feedback me. I would happily read them all and answer.

I won the Listserve lottery!Yeah! Yeah! (actually I originally missed the mail, but I was given a second chance!)

1.Let’s start with three quotes to set the mood:

You are a mashup of what you let into your life.(Austin Kleon)

I am always doing that which I cannot do,in order that I may learn how to do it. (Pablo Picasso)

If you always do what you've always done,you'll always get what you've always got.(Attributed to lots of different people… but, really, who cares about the author...)

2.I’ll share these thoughts:

— My goal here is to discuss the subject “Jack of all trades vs. Master of one” attitude (yes: one, not ""none"") and have your feedback — check wikipedia for “Jack of all trades”.— My curiosity leads me to explore and practice lots of different things (and that is good!).— The same curiosity makes me to swap between things a lot and that *might* be bad (for sure it gives me a sense of guilt).— I think that “society” in general favors the image of expert people (they *are* romantic!) over generalists.— Things are not black or white, the world is complex.

3.Questions for you guys:

A. Where do you place yourself? Generalist or expert? A mix of the two?B. How do you balance between horizontal (multi-skill) and vertical (one) learning/practicing?C. How do you select your sources? (people/events/books/websites/tv/etc.) How do you edit what you expose yourself to?D. Share your best sources. What inspires you?E. Do you have principles/rules/routines that help you through your day/life? Do you actually follow them?

4.Bonus tracks:

Check the handbook for new employees at Valve (google it! - no links allowed here)It’s all awesome but start with page 39 (Putting more tools in your toolbox) and 46 (We value “T-shaped” people). I think it might be “THE ANSWER” to this mail.

“Non-reading is not just the absence of reading. It is a genuine activity, one that consists of adopting a stance in relation to the immense tide of books that protects you from drowning. On that basis, it deserves to be defended and even taught.”(Pierre Bayard)

“Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story. Go after the dark matter, in whatever field you choose to explore.”(Nathan Wolfe)

The general idea is that you sign up to a list. Then someone buys a empty sketchbook, sticks the list on the cover, does a drawing/writing on the first page, then sends the book to the second person in the list, who fills the second page and sends it on. I signed up for one of these, but nothing came of it. I waited and waited. But the physical realm is perilous, and I was not surprised to never receive anything. Being a computer geek, I always wondered how I could translate this to the digital medium. Then one day I found out about the listserve. And then bang: the eureka moment.So, this is what I have come up with.

I imagine most of you have played the game Word Association. It involves two or more people. A person begins by saying a random word. The second person has to say a word that is associated to that one. The third person has to say a word associated to the second, and so for. The rules basically state that you cannot repeat a word already said, and you cannot hesitate more than a few seconds. So, of example, I could start with “cloud”, then could come “rain”, “water”, “cold”, “hot”, etc. You get the picture.Now, how’s this gonna work you ask me. Well, I’ve setup a tumbler at associationsketchbook dot tumblr. Each and every one of you who is subscribed to the listserve can participate. You simply need to email me your email address. I will put you in a list. The first person to email me gets to play second (since I’ve already started the sketchbook), the second person gets to play third, etc. What you’ll have to do is create a tumblr post, complete with Title and Body. The Title will need to be the next associated word. The body should be connected with the title, but can be WHATEVER you want. It can be a photo you’ve taken, a poem, a video, music. Whatever. Since this is tumblr, I personally think things need to be short and quick. So text should be one small paragraph, video less than a minute, sound as well. At the bottom of each post I will include the “source” if you want. So if the image is from flickr, I’ll put the source. You should own the copyright of what you are sending, unless it’s a youtube/vimeo video, in which case I can embed without copyright problems. Same goes for soundcloud/mixcloud audio.

Since there are so many people on the list serve, I really want to try and get two / three posts up a day. But to do this, I’ll need you to be very quick in responding when I send you the request. And to do this, you need to wait for the previous person to have selected their associated word and post the content. So lets be choppy. If I don’t get a response in 24 hours, I’ll skip you. You need simply re-email me, and I’ll put you on the bottom of the list.

That said, I hope this is all clear, and let’s have fun!!!

First is ""He wins everything!"" I tend to argue against that one, though having just won the listserve lottery I guess I won't bother this time. Second: ""He knows everything that's going on!"" This one, I'm ok with. I love going out and finding new things to do, and making other people come with. Life can get boring when you never leave your living room. Anyway, friends moving to new cities have asked for advice on how to find new places and events. Here are some tips:

1) Alt News WeekliesMost midsize-to-large cities will have an Alt Newsweekly or two, those hip newspapers you see in boxes all over the place. They tend to have giant event calendars on their websites. Check them out! The bigger the city, the more silly stuff you'll have to sort through, but it's a good way to see what's going on! Plus, newspapers are great! Read 'em sometimes. [Also, they totally have a ton of contests.]

2) Indiscriminate Facebook LikingThose same Alt Newsweeklies probably have Facebook pages. Like them! Music venues in town? Like them! Cool clubs, art spaces, restaurants, blogs, like 'em all! Yeah, you'll have to sort through a lot of junk, but if you get good at using lists you can keep your newsfeed from getting too unwieldy. You'll get some spammy posts, but also find out when the bar downtown is having a free scotch tasting, or about that secret movie screening behind the warehouse, or the new restaurant's soft opening, or the rickshaw company's birthday blowout. See also: Twitter, Email Lists, Blogs. [Note: indiscriminate facebook liking is also a great way to win contests. Just saying.]

3) ...Ask other people? Friends? Strangers? Whatever you're comfortable with I guess.

4) Make your own events!Sometimes everything sounds boring. So... start something that's not. You can even borrow other people's ideas. My friend didn't want to have to go all the way to Maine for competitive Wife Carrying (look it up!) so he helped get it started in Wyoming (as the Cowgirl Olympics). My favorite community story-telling event stopped here, but someone picked it back up in another city an hour away. Maybe start a Kinetic Sculpture Race (look that one up too). There's an annual scavenger hunt at UVA inspired/adapted from the much bigger one in Chicago. And PLEASE check out the Collective of Lady Arm Wrestlers. CLAW started in Charlottesville, but now has spread all across the country. They would love to help you start your own league! 

These things seem a little too intense? Just have a dinner party. Or a board game night. Or a Sustained Silent Reading group at a local bar. Whatever's your thing.

So yeah! Go check stuff out! Email me and let me know what cool events you've found or started! Also, easy recipes. I could always use more recipes.

January 2014,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/01/09/slutty-witches/,"January 2014, 09",Slutty witches,"Hello there. A friend of mine introduced me to the listserve a few years back, so Zuleyma if you’re still on here: hi, it's Danielle!

I’ve decided to talk about the two things most important to me (which also happen to be the two most criticized things about me): witchcraft and feminism.

now im almost 100% certain that my use of the terms 'witchcraft' and 'feminism' alone has scared a few people off, but for those of you who remain, thank you. im not here to preach to you all; im just here to share some stuff & make some people more aware of the issues that the vast majority of society  likes to pretend don’t exist.

sadly, feminists have such a bad rep. Here is how this conversation usually goes:me- are you a feminist?person- oh god no never absolutely notme-well, do you believe women and men should be equal?person- well, of course my friends, if you believe women and men should have equal rights, you are a feminist. Many feel as though women have already achieved full equality, and while we have achieved a lot... We still have a long way to go.

Here are few terms that are a little too ingrained in our society: man up, don’t be a pussy, grow a pair, you throw like a girl, boys will be boys, the list goes on and on. you get the picture.

Can you all do me a favor? Erase the words 'slut' from your vocabulary. It is a term invented to shame a woman for being comfortable with her sexuality. God forbid, right?

rape culture. rape culture. rape culture. my best friend, Keagan (what you mras would probably call a mangina) once said: “I think there are more false accusations of false accusations of rape than there are actual false accusations of rape”

I recommend 'ceedling' on YouTube. Her videos are amazing & she is much more articulate than I am on these subjects.

i receive a lot of “well why don’t you call yourself a wiccan instead of a witch?” or “why not call yourself a humanist, rather than a feminist?” (I suppose to avoid negative connotation). the history of witches and feminists, what they’ve accomplished, what they’ve overcome lies in those names.

When most people hear the word, “witch,” they probably think of old, green hags, using their powers for evil, harming others. The media has done a stupendous job at making us think of witches as ugly and maleficent.

practices vary from coven to coven, but there is some common ground for all types of witches. Witchcraft teaches people about ethical ways to use magic--Spells that bring luck, healing, self-empowerment, etc. Witches are harmonious thinkers. Wicca is a nature-based religion and most Wiccans focus on the power and independence of females. And they don't believe in the devil.

 it is actually Christianity that ruined the reputation of witches. Christian priests in the Middle Ages associated the Pagan hoofed god with the christian Devil, and this belief persists today. this is probably where the stereotype that witches are “Satan worshippers” came from.

It is a sad, sad realization to reach-realizing how many people are uneducated about the subject or just outright ignore it. Realizing that we may be in too deep with these misconceptions—for the sake of Hollywood and popular culture, witches will probably always be depicted as malicious, Satanic, evil creatures.

The best I can do is win the listserve and try to open a few eyes to the sexist, racist, homophobic, witch-fearing world we live in.

My friend Jamie, I met on Twitter. He was the friend of a friend and we hit it off right away, triggering our friendship groups merging. My friends on Twitter and his friends on Twitter all following each other in a virtual friendship ecosystem, all based on 140-character replies to each other.

There comes a point, though, where Twitter stops being useful for the number of people all trying to join in a conversation at once. And after an aborted attempt at linking everything using the hashtag #wangingout (forgive the juvenile dick joke; 2012 was a different era), and being geographically disparate enough to make regular in-person hanging out tricky, we took it old school and set up the IRC channel #wangingout on the Freenode servers. People keep a window open on their PCs during the day and in those little stretches of five-minute downtime everyone gets between tasks at work, we hang out.

And it’s awesome. There have been surges in my IRC use over the years, notably when I was 10 and used to rush home from school every day to get online and talk about Pokémon with other kids, and of course in the bash/qdb heyday of ten years ago. I always remembered IRC bots from those old days, little programmatic tools that could take on the role of channel op and curate a library of text-based commands to help out the channel or just entertain. So: wangbot.

From an initial twenty-line script with a handful of pre-set responses, wangbot has grown into a twitter client and a website and a chronicler of our lives. People in the chan can add greetings that he’ll parrot when people log on for the day. We hold votes: straw opinion polls, feature requests, even planning winter celebration events, and the results go into the online “statute book” for people to look up. We reward each other for good chatter, funny jokes, and winning games, all with #wangingout points. People can look up how much they reciprocate point-awarding and how aligned their voting record is.

But the feature that seems to have captured people’s imaginations and hearts is the !opine function. Every night, wangbot looks over the day’s chatlogs and puts groups of three words, and how frequently they’re said together, into his database. Then, given the command, he can try to link some of the three-word atoms into sentences. Try. With *very* varied success.

It’s not meant to be an attempt at a Loebner Prize competitor or anything; it’s just a little bit of fun. A minor experiment in how little code I can write to spout novel lines that, occasionally, have us all fighting to suppress out-loud laughter at our desks at work.

I’ve been into programming since I first touched my dad’s Commodore 64 as a young child. I went to university to study computer science and I code as part of my job. But I usually never get very far with personal projects. Motivation drops off after a while and I am left with yet another unfinished project. But with wangbot it’s different. It’s like I’m coding for an audience, but without the pressure of it having to be monetisable like you’d have with a software startup. At the start of April, wangbot will be two years old, and by far the creation I am most proud of.

If anything I do is worth sharing with thousands of strangers, it’s definitely my weird desire to make crappy jokey internet services for my friends to mess around with.

You know the one: the samey, glib personal advice column that's some variation on ""Eat, Pray, Code,"" composed just before or after selling all one's possessions in order to backpack through Europe / go to college / deliver a TED talk.

All of these emails have something in common, which pushes me to send along my tiny sliver of advice:

BE AWARE OF YOUR OWN PRIVILEGE.

I'm a well-off white male who can afford to live in one of the greatest places in the world and hold down a steady, semi-inspiring job. Moneyed itinerancy, grad school and motivational speaking aren't for me, but they're all within reach.

Since the Listserve flock is self-selected, it makes sense that most of you would share at least some of the same privilege. Just do me a favor: step back for a second and recognize what you have. Then realize how it informs your everyday interactions with the people you meet, and for god's sake, do something constructive with it.

Maybe instead of sharing the same personal advice columns or superficial first-day-of-summer-camp facts about yourself, do a little soul-searching -- the kind that doesn't involve 'Chicken Soup,' you know? Then report back with what you've learned.

I'd take my own advice but I think I'm over the word count...

Some things I've been thinking about that I would love discussing with people:

1) I'm an atheist, and I have a lot of trouble dealing with the fact that I'm going to die.  I was wondering if there were other atheists that had this problem (and overcame it?) who could give me advice!

2) I'm very interested in food/nutrition/health.  I'm a vegan, and I love to cook and eat healthy!  Its sad that the majority of people eat like crap, and I'd love to brainstorm ways to change this!  (I have a vegan/vegetarian food blog by the way so let me know if you want to see it and i'll send you a link!)

3) I struggle a lot with the idea of ""what is natural?"".  I want to be as natural as possible, but couldn't one argue that everything a human does is by definition natural?  

I really wanted to send some profound email about healthiness or whatever, but since I don't have time this is the best I can do.  Sorry!  Hope some of you would like to chat!  Since I'm in China for January, I might not be able to respond for a while, but I will definitely get back to you in February.

Yet, you're still you --with all your memories, your personality. If scientists insist on chasing particles, they will follow them right through an organism and miss the organism entirely.""—Robert Rosen

The quote above has captivated me for awhile now. Simply put, each of us feels as if we're more than just our parts. It seems as if somehow (somewhere?) we emerge from the cosmic soup of trillions of cells that comprise the human body. But there is another possibility -- that our autonomy as thinking, feeling entities is a private illusion we tell ourselves. Not only are there countless microcosms -- of tissues, microbes, and molecules -- in each of us but we, in turn, are parts of larger societies -- of families, nations, and planetary ecosystems. As human beings, we may feel and act as if we are autonomous creatures but what if we consider the possibility that this is merely an anthrocentrism? A product of human pride? Since matter and physical forces are continuous in the universe (i.e., the same fundamental laws of physics operate everywhere) then is it such a big step to acknowledge the possibility that mental phenomena (such as personal identity or agency) can also be distributed in the universe?

We seem to be caught between external and internal forces that impinge on us. So where do ""we"" begin and where do ""we"" end?

January 2014,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2014/01/04/go-west/,"January 2014, 04",Go west,"It figures. I've been on this list for well over a year and always figured I'd have the perfect thing to say when the time came, yet here I sit not having a clue.

At one point I had thought about writing about myself, how I grew up in suburban Oklahoma and moved to Los Angeles after high school nearly 14 years ago to study film and writing at USC, but instead (and wisely) went into digital publishing and have had a good deal of success there. But that seemed self-indulgent.

At another point, I wanted to write about Los Angeles, and how it is both distinctly cruel and benevolent. Just when the traffic has you entertaining nearly constant thoughts of suicide or the most perverse yet ostentatious form vehicular manslaughter, you find yourself headed toward the coast alone on Mulholland one summer evening just after sunset with the windows open and the wind carrying the sweet earthy scent of chaparral and sage, a Joe Frank monologue on the radio, and you realize that anything and everything is possible. But that's been done before.

Maybe I'll write a list of favorites—authors like TC Boyle, a mentor and an inspiration—or Stewart O'Nan, Denis Johnson or Dan Choan; filmmakers like Hitchcock, Kazan, Sayles or Wyler. I'd go into music it but it'd take to long and lists are too often boring anyway.

So maybe I'll just quote my favorite passage from what I've always regarded as The Perfect American Novel (and maybe the Greatest, but that superlative has always seemed a bit loaded to me),  ""All the King's Men,"" chapter 7:

""I was headed out down a long bone-white road, straight as a string  and smooth as glass and glittering and wavering in the heat and humming under the tires like a plucked nerve. I was doing seventy-five but I never seemed to catch up with the pool that seemed to be over the road just this side of the horizon. Then, after a while, the sun was in my eyes, for I was driving west. So I pulled the sun screen down and squinted and put the throttle to the floor. And kept on moving west. For West is where we all plan to go someday. It is where you go when the land gives out and the old-field pines encroach. It is where you go when you get the letter saying: 'Flee, all is discovered.' It is where you go when you look down at the blade in your hand and see the blood on it. It is where you go when you are told that you are a bubble on the tide of empire. It is where you go to grow up with the country. It is where you go to spend your old age. Or it is just where you go.""

If you ever moved west from Oklahoma or thereabouts, you probably know the feeling.

Always try to do interesting things and be well.

Some of the best things tend to happen in the grey area between the fine line of what's wrong and what's right. In that sense, drunken nights are a symbol for this tension. I honestly believe happiness is defined by the experience of contrasts: know the down, appreciate the up.

In about a week, I’m changing my uncluttered life in the Netherlands for a unique field research project in the outskirts of Zambia.  Nation states are the building blocks of our modern world order. Successful ones exercise profound influence on the course of world history: international organizations consist of states, multinational companies are still subject to state law, and every citizen is formally part of a state. Failed ones are the black holes of this world – many of today’s problems, ranging from poverty to transnational criminality, are relatable to a malfunctioning state.

However, this was not obvious a few centuries ago. There was a heavy competition between several forms of ways to organize a community: kingdoms, republics, federations, city-states, autocracies and more. The nation state became in our thinking about states nevertheless the dominant form of organizing a community: invisible constructions with a visible impact, rational in their irrationality. The essential question is: how can we understand this phenomenon?

I’m conducting field research in Zambia to explore the emergence of a nation state: how do a national state, national culture and national economy intertwine? I have three months to discover this topic. Excitement prevails, since this will be my first research project and steps into Africa. But I strongly believe that it doesn’t matter how many books one can read or documentaries one can watch - complex processes are best understood when you can feel them, smell them and taste the flavor of reality.

Any suggestions, questions or help regarding this project are more than welcome! I would love to read it: 

Finally, music. Here are ten songs that are in my opinion very good, but not enough appreciated:

I have amazing students, but 99% of them have never been outside Japan.  They’ve only seen other parts of the world through TV or the Internet.  I'd like for them to see some snapshots of life around the world in a way that (literally) speaks to them personally.  And with the power of The Listserve, I have an opportunity to make that happen.  I hope you'll help me.

I want to collect short video messages from you, introducing a slice of your life in whatever place you live.  It could be a local custom or festival that you're participating in, you could introduce the work that you do, or a hobby.  Or it could be as simple as showing us an interesting place in your town, or a local food.  It’s up to you.

It doesn't need to be long or complicated, and it doesn't need to be edited.  Just a quick video that you shot with your cell phone camera is fine.  But however you do it, I have some requests:

1. Please include a greeting to my students, to grab their attention and make it personal: the town's name is Kurobe (pronounced ""koo-RHO-bay"") and the school is Sakurai (""SOCK-oo-rye"") Junior High School.2. Introduce yourself!  Please tell us your name and where you're from, and anything else you'd like to share about yourself (age, birthday, job, interests, favorite movie, etc.)3. Please pick something to introduce that you can SHOW us on the video!  Having a visual to go along with the explanation will make it much easier to understand.4. Please speak clearly and a little slower than your natural conversational speed.

Send your videos to me at  either directly attached to the email, or send me a link to it on dropbox/google drive/yousendit/etc.

That's it!  All in all, it shouldn't take more than a few minutes of your time, and it would be really fun for my students to get personalized video messages from around the world.

BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE!  It's not fair for you to just give your valuable time to my students and get nothing back, so here's the really cool part: every year we do a project in which my students make English commercials to advertise a local food or shop.  If this idea works, though, I’d like to slightly alter that project and have them make video responses to your messages!  So, if you’re kind enough to send us a video, you’ll get one back!

Disclaimers: I just came up with this idea in the last 24 hours, and although I run my classes, I don't have total control over what we can do.  I’ll have to OK this idea with my supervisors.  I think it should be fine, but there’s a chance that it won't be—in which case, I apologize in advance.  Also, if we are able to do it, there are a lot of people on this Listserve.  While I'm sure not everyone will respond and send us a video, we still might get more than we can handle.  If we’re unable to make a response for every individual message we receive, I’ll at least send a personal email to apologize and thank you for your time.  I’ll also send mass emails to everyone who contributes with updates on how the project is going.

Please email me with any questions, too!

Thank you, and Happy New Year!  Have a wonderful 2014!

He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. -Albert Einstein

Pilgrim. Artist. Explorer. Lover. Lost. Looking for a tiger. Seeking that which has always been and lies within: absolute freedom.

I enjoy exploring near and far, within and without and seeing what adventures arise along the way. This particular lost phase of the last year has been more of a struggle, living in a place where I have been based for 10 years, broken-hearted, feeling mostly disconnected, occasionally overwhelmed and too tired. I dance. I unravel. The practice of life. I might need to find my voice. And what if I wish to speak without words?

I keep breathing. Sometimes: inhaling..pause.. exhaling..pause. I am a child of life. Walking often. Observing. Wishing to learn how to fly. Wishing to learn to understand and speak a new language and share stories. Wishing to create and build and grow life with love in magnificent collaboration. Much to share and much to learn. Really craving to find the way and the place to serve best, to sing and dance, share stories and strength and laughter and connect along this journey. I believe I can serve better with the right partners. It might be on a small farm near the sea where others can come rest their heads and share their ideas, dance and create, where will together make delicious food, which we have grown in the land, and sit together, nourishing body and soul. Or it might be in the middle of a big city. It might just be everywhere. I do not yet know. Is it already happening?

This phase of my little adventure might just be about letting it all go. Surrender. As I know very well, I know nothing. This season has been about diving deeper and deeper inward into the darkness. I didn't check my email for a few days (typical behavior lately) and unsure this will make it out to the group. We shall see if this makes it out via The Listserve and we shall see what rises again with the light in the months ahead...  Que sera..sera.

I am ever grateful and in love with the dear souls with whom I have crossed paths and I get to adventure with along this life.

I send postcards. If you would like a card and some love via the post, do send your mailing address.

Like a mirror my soul displays secrets; I am able not to speak, but I am unable not to know. -Rumi

I enjoy the new year, and like many, use it as a time to review the past years accomplishments/failures and to look forward to what may occur in the new year.  This past year, the big news for us was the birth of our sixth child. We hadn't exactly planned on having six kids, but she's been a great addition to our family, and certainly keeps us busy. For the upcoming year, one of my goals is to complete another mobile educational game for kids. I completed a simple math game a few years back and it was a ton of fun to develop.  In addition to doing the design and programming, I also tried my hand at the music and art for the game.  That turned out to be one of the hardest parts of the game to complete. I think it came out ok, but could be way better. If you want to check it out, look for Balloon Blast Math in the app store. It's amazing how important good art and music is to truly bring a game together.  This is where I ask the Listserve community for help.I would like to hear from all the educators, musicians and artists out there.  What would you do to make an educational game better?

For the educators:How do you see mobile games helping kids learn the basics of reading, writing, arithmetic, science and music?  From what you've played or seen kids play in the past, what works well and what doesn't?  Have you ever had any ideas, but don't know where to start?

For the musicians:What are some great basics skills that all young musicians must learn that could be put into a game?  For other types of games, would any of you ever like to be involved in the creation process or create music for a game?  

For the artists:I need help!  I can pull off some programmer art, but anything beyond that looks pretty bad.  I'd love some help! Have you ever wanted to contribute art of graphic design to a game?

Anyway, if you have any suggestions or are interested in helping out, send me an email.  Otherwise, have a great new year!

December 2013,30,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/12/30/long-goodbyes/,"December 2013, 30",Long Goodbyes,"1.I lost my mother to brain cancer in March 2010. Glioblastoma multiforme, a hyper-aggressive menace. Surgery, radiation, and a litany of intimidatingly-named drugs granted her three years, twice the median. But of course, it wasn't enough. It could never be enough. The disease and its remedies slowed her speech, first transposing words, then substituting the wrong ones, then silencing her altogether. For someone who had always been articulate and quick-witted, it must have been maddening. I certainly felt helpless every step of the way, watching the inexorable decline, hoping in the last days that somehow we could have just one more conversation, that the morphine drip and the pain it suppressed would abate long enough for one more ""I love you"" to make it through.

It never did.

The pain of loss may vary in intensity but it never goes away. I take some occasional comfort in one of the themes of Douglas Hofstadter's book ""I Am a Strange Loop"": those who are close to us make little copies of us in their minds. It's what allows us to say, ""I know how So-and-so would feel about this."" And so to the extent that she bore me and raised me and I now carry her memory, she's still with me.

2.I got engaged at the age of 25 to my college sweetheart. We had dated spasmodically between 2006 and 2009, then she joined the Air Force Reserve and went off to med school. In 2010, I was working my first job in Atlanta, and we reconnected and entered a long-term relationship. I had my misgivings about the whole thing: I had a penchant for cheating and we fought frequently (about everything, even how to load the dishwasher). I loved her as a person and a friend, but I wasn't committed enough to love her as a life-long partner. I'm still not sure I have that capacity. We were engaged on New Year's Day 2011 and moved in together the following summer. As much as I might have wished for things to get better, they (surprise!) stayed exactly the same as they had been during our previous dating. Eighteen months in, I was clinically depressed, very nearly an alcoholic, and having fantasies about me or her being involved in a fatal accident just for the escape it would provide.

As a passive individual, it's hard to me to make significant decisions that will cause a lot of pain without immediate upside. I agonized over the choice for almost a year realizing that if I left, I'd be giving up my place to live. More importantly I’d be forsaking the person who loved me and knew me best. Despite our difficulties, when we were good together, we were great together, which made it that much harder to leave. But I couldn't stay, because I couldn't be the person she needed, and our professional trajectories were diverging quickly as it came time for her to enter her Air Force residency.

So a year ago this week I walked away. In hindsight it was the hardest and best thing I've ever done for myself.

3.When I was 19 years old I became an atheist. I could tell you the story, but I'm short on words and vitriol is boring (feel free to reply for the extended cut). Be as gracious and giving and kind as you can, and strive to repair what you will inevitably break.

4.I've tried to share here without being didactic, because the lessons taught by pain, loss, and grief do not generalize. If you would like to share your stories with me, I will read and reply to every message I receive. Thank you for reading.

In fact, your heart is made to break; its purpose is to burst open again and again so that it can hold evermore wonders.” – Andrew Harvey

As an almost-20 year old, I feel like it isn't my place to offer others advice. (Except, maybe, to someone under 20 years old, in which case, two things: First, take education very seriously, not because it will make you wealthy or prominent, but because it will immensely enrich your life. Second, it is very hard to avoid becoming very much like one or both of your parents when you grow up. This isn't a piece of advice but rather an observation.)

Anyways, I was recently thinking about getting a tattoo of the phrase, ""This too shall pass,"" in Hebrew. (I recommend reading the Wikipedia page about this phrase, as it provides some intriguing insight and history.) My best friend texted me some advice, which included the following sentence: ""I think you are the type of person who can tell others what in your life has meaning without it being on your body."" It was incredibly thought-provoking, and I realized she was right.

I suppose this is my chance to do so, seeing as this email is all I have to show you all what in my life has meaning. Because I don’t think I should be offering advice, and because my best friend’s words have had such a profound effect on me, I hope it won't be too conceited or boring to mention what has made my life good: staying perpetually curious and fascinated.

I have learned as much from an astronomy course taught by Alex Filippenko (Google him!) as I have from a class on English literature from 1300-1650, or from my 13-month-old niece’s laughter, or from travelling all over Europe, or from reading Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s Wikipedia page. I think it is nice to be reminded that our lives and our selves are very teeny tiny parts of the vast world (not to mention the universe!). There’s a lot to see, hear, read, and encounter out there; some of it might be momentarily interesting and then get lost somewhere in the depths of your memory, and some of it might be so incredibly powerful and overwhelming that it will stay with you forever. Here are a few things that have fallen in the latter category for me, and I hope they will for you, as well: J.D. Salinger’s Franny and Zooey, Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, Death Cab for Cutie’s “St. Peter’s Cathedral,” the word “ephemeral,” and the city of Berkeley, California.

(If you’re a fellow UC Berkeley student, and you’ve read this far, let’s be friends! “Sometimes life is merely a matter of coffee and whatever intimacy a cup of coffee affords.” - Richard Brautigan)

There are three things I would like to do before my time here (in this world, not in this email) is up: be a loving and happy wife and mother (and grandmother and great-grandmother…), write something (be it an essay, a poem, a bunch of poems, a short story, a bunch of short stories, or a novel) (or a mix of all of those) that stirs people’s souls, and get appointed to the United States Supreme Court (it’s a pipe dream, but that’s okay).

In the mean time, I still have a lot to learn. You’re welcome to teach me.

I need a lot of help. It would be nice if you would take a moment to share your wisdom with me. I have some questions:

How did you figure out your gender/sexuality? Did it just come to you? Did you just kind of assume it and it felt natural to you? What was “society” and its norms’ affect on it? Do you think it is “wired” in your DNA or the way you were raised?

For those of you who are enjoying life, HOW DO I DO THAT? What did you do to get there??

For those of you who have done the higher education thing, WHAT DO I DO?

What do you think about the education system? (Google Finland’s education system for perspective.)

HOW DO I LIVE LIFE?

Do you have any good jokes? I really love puns.

------------------------------------

I haven’t lived a lot of my life, but I don’t think I’m going to enjoy living the rest of it.In a first-world society like ours, one popular fear is ending up on Skid Row, homeless, alone, and with no support. If you ask others their biggest fears are, it’ll be things like “public speaking” or “spiders.”

If you ask me, I fear living the 9 to 5 life—10 years down the road, I might be working some boring office job, focusing on a “career” I don’t want, since I was forced to declare a major at a time when I couldn’t even decide what to order at McDonald’s for lunch.Let’s get real—I still don’t know what to order at McDonald’s. I have no idea what I want to do or how I want to live my life…but being stuck in something I have no passion for? That’s the worst thing I can imagine. I’d rather die.

I hate my uncertainty. I wish I knew what I wanted. I don’t know a lot about myself, to be honest. I love chemistry, and I love fantasy fiction. I hate being left alone in my own head, but I hate being around too many people, because in both, there is too much to worry about all at once.  It’s all a balance, right?

One escape I’ve found are in fandoms. Harry Potter, for example, has saved me on multiple occasions. If you were to learn anything from this email, it would be that YOU SHOULDN’T BE AFRAID TO DEDICATE YOURSELF TO SOMETHING YOU LIKE. For me, it means at least I know *something* about myself. ;) But there are just some things I can’t escape! I have problems (college tuition, applying to grad school, etc) and pessimistic views about the world (global warming has doomed us). And I’m not sure what my gender or sexuality is.

(((Really, what kind of BS is our education system here in the US? Kids do not have the same access to (higher) education. What we teach our kids is outdated! Technology is moving so fast and we aren’t integrating that into our classrooms enough. As I saw on tumblr the other day, we are preparing youth for jobs that don’t exist anymore, and developing new jobs no one is being prepared for.Another thing, higher education is so…. STUPID! Tumblr made me ask: why is it, that to get an education, we’re under a debt sentence? (Get it? Cause “death” and “debt”? HAHA I laugh at stupid jokes.))))

Perhaps my two greatest teachers have been pain and community. I first learned of pain from my father who humbly and quietly endured 40 years of kidney stones and chronic pain before cancer claimed his weary body. It strengthened his soul and was an invaluable teacher to me. C.S. Lewis claimed that, “pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pains: it is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.” Khalil Gibran believed that much of our pain was self-chosen and unlocked our understanding by being the “bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.” He went on to say that, “The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.” I've known great pain, chosen and otherwise, emotional and physical. I both curse and honor this demanding teacher. (Intentional) community has been the framework through which these battles have worked themselves out in messy, beautiful and frustrating ways.

I've had the comical fortune of stumbling into some remarkable community situations. I've mostly learned from people (scarily) different from me while maintaining close fellowship with a variety of kindred spirits. Growing up in the middle of nowhere, looking at me you would never guess that I spent two years in a makeshift basement apartment in the projects of West Philly sharing a home with the strongest grandmother I've ever met and several of her grandchildren (when playing basketball in the hood, referencing your engineering degree regarding a disputed score is a great way to encourage someone to punch you). My framework of risk and purpose was drastically shifted living with a middle-class Latino family who spent many years as peacemakers and community builders among warring tribes and narco-traffickers. I fell tragically in love with their daughter and ran away to be a glorified manny for a super-rich Chinese family teaching their little emperor ‘murican English (someone peeled my grapes, cleaned my running shoes and prepared my French-pressed coffee to perfection daily). This was quite an awkward and humbling experience, difficult to process and yet overwhelming in shifting my perceptions on serving honorably and receiving undeserved love.

The title character in Shantaram claims that, “Fate gives all of us three teachers, three friends, three enemies, and three great loves in our lives. But these twelve are always disguised, and we can never know which one is which until we've loved them, left them, or fought them.”  Respect that battle; had my own ignorance won out, my father would have died without us struggling together to love and understand each other. Be vulnerable, be okay with the possibility of being wounded and open to attack. It frees others to grow into their true identity. Allow other people to be mysterious, our healed scars, travel experience and desire for strangers, enemies and loved ones to reach their potential allow us to love people wholeheartedly on our non grumpy days. Love holds things together, sees the potential, cares not cures, sacrifices entitlements, offers everything without expectation; is quick to listen and slow to speak.

I believe you become married the moment your partner agrees to marry you.  Not when you get the marriage license, or after the ceremony, but when the both of you agree.  If you think that you need the blessing of some institution before you can behave like a married couple you have abdicated the responsibility for your choice for perhaps the most important plot arc of your life.

An engagement only gives your friends and family time to make travel arrangements.  Celebrate your marriage in whatever way you choose, but celebrate the done deal and not the doing.

These two bits of my father's wisdom, dealing nominally with finance and footwear, I hope you find as broadly applicable as I:

""There's no such thing as a tube stock.  One size does not fit all.""""There are only two sizes of shoe: fit and don't-fit.""

For that reason I thought that if I ever got chosen, I'd send a cheese joke or a witty one liner. But when I got the email it suddenly didn't seem that simple - it felt really weird - should I really do that when I have the opportunity to speak out to more people than I might ever get the chance to again?

So for better of for worse, this is what I've decided to say:

I like running. I used to hate people who said they liked running. It made me feel bad when I was sitting on the sofa eating cake. Now I still hate people who say they like running a bit, but I can eat more cake than I did before without becoming a human sphere.

I run for me. I run alone and I have my own targets. I race against myself. I run wherever I want to, whenever I want to. 

If I have had a rubbish day, I can go for a run and it makes me feel better. I'm not sure about my direction in life, or my career, or my relationship, but running is something that I can be sure about.

People are really important, surround yourself with them and love them back - but ultimately you cannot trust them. People are unpredictable, just like you are. 

So my advice to you for 2014 would be to go out and find something for you, just for you. Something that you can be totally selfish about. Something that you can come back to when the other things aren't going so well. 

In 2014 I am going to run my first marathon. I don't know where I will be at with anything else in my life, things are far from perfect at the moment, but it feels so incredibly good to have one thing to be sure of.

I moved into a sublet, found a temp job, and started a zine. Attending countless punk shows during this time from Reno to LA, sleeping on couches, driving all-nighters, close friends and new friends are one in the same, but you lose track of people--I did. Time passes: career, marriage, kids.

This year I got an email from my estranged step-mom hoping to catch up and reconnect.  It's a nostalgic season, I have a 2-year-old daughter who has spurred me to re-size my heart, and I needed to forgive my step-mom.  We exchanged a few emails, a promise of a phone call, and that was the end of it.  It was a quick wash of the hands of the whole dirty business.  I felt adult, matter-of-fact, professional.  I could HANDLE STUFF.

Later that same week I get an unexpected FedEx at my office. Unusual. It was from an old friend from my punk rock zine days. I'm instantly filled with dread. Heart stops. This is the stuff of existential life crises. Sh*t. Do I tell my husband? Is there a severed ear in there? The return address is only his first name and a PO box. What the hell could this be?  I was a crusty, delinquent 20 year old, but turned out OK. This person could be anything.

I opened the package carefully. Inside the envelope were clippings from my zine and a thick stack of photographs of me and friends from shows and travels all over the West Coast, notes, drawings--Priceless stuff.   I thought back to my 20s: getting elbowed in the boob by Jello Biafra, the thick grime of Gilman Street, pretending to be tough at Slims, the ancient band members at the Holidays in the Sun, late nights locating my car after a show freezing in my fishnets.  The friends from those days, the boys, the music.

I sent a nice, short note thanking him for sending the package.  I didn't hear back. Nothing. Someone let the air out of the balloon.

You don't usually get the resolution you're hoping for, but I am grateful for the gesture.

All, 

My name is Ritesh and I am from Bangalore, India. I am engineer by profession and I'm currently pursuing my dream of starting a software product startup. In my spare time, I read as much as time permits, play the guitar, take nature walks, and enjoy birdwatching. I also dabble a bit in photography and video making. I am a big fan of satire and dark comedy, and I'm writing some material to present at a comedy club.

After graduation, I found myself in an IT job and married my long time sweetheart Prateeksha. Both Prateeksha and I are rationalists and realists, and live in a crazy country called India. Having being born in an era where we had access to cable television, western media and the internet, our values are a mixture of Indian conservatism and western liberalism, and we started realizing very early on our differences in culture, living standards, and expectations from life. 

We both decided to follow some rules to make our lives more comfortable and I thought it was best to share these ideas with the listserve crowd. 1. Do what you love and be the best at it. No recession or economic downturn can affect your earning prospects. 2. Pick up a hobby. Learn to play an instrument, pick up photography or just watch nature. It will give you peace of mind and will also keep you occupied. 3. Stay very close to your workplace. It might be more expensive, but the time saved is priceless, and it gives you more time with your partner and for your hobbies. 4. Buy a really comfortable bed - you sleep for almost a third of your life, why compromise on comfort? 5. Whatever tools and technologies your work requires, buy the best the money can buy. If you are a professional guitarist, buy the best guitar money can buy. If you use computers, buy the latest greatest thing. Better tools improve productivity and reduce frustration. 6. Eat healthy and eat at the appropriate times of the day. Don't skip meals. During my post grad days, I neglected eating and sleeping at the right times and paid a terrible price for it. 7. TRAVEL - that's all there's to it in life. Experience everything life, culture and nature has to offer. Take at least 2 vacations a year. Need not be exotic but you should make a habit of it. Be aggressive about it.8. Socialize - make new friends, speak to old ones and build long relationships. Travel with friends. Visit every wedding, get together and birthday party. Don't expect anything from anyone but play your part. Remember that your family and friends are you support structure in your time of need. 9. Find a partner who you can relate to. A person I knew told me, ""you can probably have sex 30 mins in a day, the rest of the time, you need to talk"". Make sure you find a companion with who you can talk for hours. 

That's it. I followed these simple rules and have found great joy and contentment in life. Every decision I take in my life, I assess the impact on these factors and I immediately find the answers I am looking for. 

If you have things that you want to add to this list, I would love to hear about it. Write to me and I shall collate all of them and put it out there (with the appropriate credits). Lastly, try Indian food. While the western world was urbanizing, mechanizing and growing their economies, we Indians were innovating on food. Ask an Indian friend for suggestions (should be easy to find one, there are more than a billion of us). 

Live long and prosper. Ritesh M NayakBangalore, India"

Ive always been ambitious by doing things for myself, freelance, build businesses, fail, start over, succeed, fail etc. Until I reached a point where I almost forgot what I was doing and why. Entrepreneurship comes with a price and it takes a while before you feel like you have hit the jackpot, financially but mostly emotionally. The pressure in wanting so much for me turned into a daily routine of obsession and anxiety. I found everything boring and just came to the conclusion I lost my Mojo, and it was somewhere out trying to find me, But I was too tired to look for it myself.

My father passed away when I was 10, he moved out to Ghana 20 years ago to follow his dream and unfortunately passed away within 3 months. So i took a leap of faith this year and decided to start something for myself in Accra and honor his leap of faith. I started 2 businesses and officially launching Access Accra a city guide and platform here that will launch in February.

There for – it was only right, to share with you guys a piece of a beautiful book and a fitting name for my experience this year.

Excerpt of Manuscript found in Accra – By Paulo Coelho

There is nothing wrong with anxiety.

Although we cannot control God’s time, it’s part of the human condition to want to receive the thing we are waiting for as quickly as possible.

Or to drive away whatever is causing our fear.

This is so from childhood onward, until we reach

the age when we become indifferent to life. Because

as long as we are intensely connected to the present

moment, we will always be waiting anxiously for someone

or something.

How can you tell a passionate heart to be still and to

contemplate the miracles of Creation in silence, free of

tension, fear, and unanswerable questions?

Anxiety is part of love, and should not be blamed

because of that.

How can you tell someone not to worry when he has

invested his money and his life in a dream but has yet to

see any results? The farmer cannot speed the progress

of the seasons in order to pick the fruit he planted, but

he waits impatiently for the coming of autumn and harvest

time.

How can you ask a warrior not to feel anxious before

a battle? He has trained to the point of exhaustion for this

moment; he has given of his best. While he believes he

is prepared, he fears that all his efforts could prove to be

in vain.

Anxiety was born in the very same moment as mankind.

And since we will never be able to master it, we

will have to learn to live with it—just as we have learned

to live with storms.

For those who cannot learn to do so, life will be a

nightmare. Even worse, in an attempt to drive away anxiety,

they do things that make them even more anxious.

And the eyes of the soul are bleary with tiredness.

At that point, in walks one of humankind’s worst

enemies: obsession.

Obsession arrives and says:

“Your fate now belongs to me. I will make you look

for things that do not exist.

“Your joy in living belongs to me, too. From now on,

your heart will know no peace because I will drive out

enthusiasm and take its place. “

Therefore, although anxiety is part of life, never let it

control you. –

December 2013,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/12/19/are-you-a-donk/,"December 2013, 19",Are you a DONK?,"Did you know a dog has a specific pH balance with their skin that is much different than humans?  Depending on a lot of variables with the dog, their pH levels tend to be a lot higher than that of a human.  So, if a human shampoo (or something worse) is used on a dog for bath time, the dog's pH level will be thrown off, creating an environment where bacteria, parasites, and viruses can cause a lot of problems. 

Unknowingly, many pet owners will wash them repeatedly, trying to fix the problem, but end up making the problem worse as the skin's pH level becomes more imbalanced.  Also, if the shampoo makes their skin feel dry (a lot of them have sodium chloride- aka salt, as a thickening agent), your dog will scratch at his/her skin, creating areas for bacteria to attack and it quickly becomes a vicious cycle.

It was with all this in mind we (my soon to be wife and I) started searching for a good, all natural, pH balanced shampoo for our 6 year old Golden Retriever, Max.  Unfortunately, we couldn't find anything that met our requirements.  Something that had no parabens, sulfates, synthetic perfumes, dyes or other bad 'stuff' in it.  So, after a LOT of research we decided to formulate our own and started a business!  

We actually fall into a new demographic referred to by the acronym ""DONK"" - Dog Obsessed, No Kids.  We may add some more humans to the world after we're married.  Then they can come up with a new acronym for us. Dog Obsessed Now With Kids?  Although, DONWK doesn't flow as well.. it would probably never catch on.  

We're launching the website in the next few weeks and we would love to connect with any other pet minded people on Facebook or Twitter.  If you search for Bobo's Natural Pet Products on either you'll find us.  We actually used Max's paw print for our logo if you need any more proof of the DONK thing.  Wish us luck, starting a business is stressful and a lot more work than people think!  

To any other U.S. Marines past or present reading this- Semper Fi!  

In closing, it wouldn't be a Listserve email without a favorite quote or two so here are a few of mine..

You can have anything in the world you want if you'll just help enough other people get what they want. ~ Zig Ziglar

December 2013,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/12/18/the-karma-of-divorce/,"December 2013, 18",The karma of divorce,"When I first joined the Listserve, I knew immediately what I would write about if I ever got my turn---divorce. My own parents divorced when I was five years old, and in one of those great ironies of karma, I fell in love with a divorced dad and am now getting to see it from the other side.

I have a better understanding now of some of what my parents went through. It had never occurred to me, for instance, that my dad once had to have a conversation with my stepmother where he explained how much money he made, and how much got taken off the top in child support. And on the other side, there was the time my Beloved, after spending an afternoon dealing with an ex-caused frustration, angrily vented 'well, at least I know that when he's eighteen, I can tell him everything!' I had to gently explain to him that HE couldn't be the one to do that!

Here's the thing: when kids are involved, you have to be the grown-up, and that sometimes means sucking it up. Sucking it up doesn't mean staying married to someone you can't be married to. But it does mean letting go of your own petty stuff in the service of a good life for your kid.

Between my childhood with divorced parents, my adulthood as a stepmom, and my career as a teacher, I have seen it all, and I think most divorcing parents would do a better job if they spent less time thinking about how much they hate their ex and more time thinking about how much it would suck to be the kid in the middle of the whole thing---the kid who is told they can't go to the family holiday party with dad because it's not his weekend; the kid who can't keep a picture of Mom's new baby in his room because Dad doesn't want to hear about it; the kid who can't go the baseball game with Grandpa and the cousins because his other parent won't drive a little out of their way to drop him off; the kid who misses an appointment because one parent won't let the other one pick him up a few minutes before the official access time; the kid who is housebound for a weekend because Dad's carseat broke suddenly and Mom won't loan him hers for the weekend; the kid who spent 20 minutes crying on the front step of her school because yesterday's parent didn't tell today's parent that the usual pickup route had some road construction going on which would make them be late...

Please, divorcing parents, don't be that person. Loan Dad the carseat. Tell him about the construction. Let the other parent swap weekends for a family party. Sign the consent form so they can take the child on a special trip. Let them have an extra hour so that an out-of-town relative can see the child during a visit. Don't make your child a victim of your desire to be right, to win, to prove you know better. Maybe you do know better. Maybe you really are right. But please, be the grown-up and let your ex spend their emotional energy on being a parent, not on fighting you.

I didn’t expect for my turn to come so quickly so, of course, I’m not very well prepared! So I suppose this will be a hodge-podge, of sorts.  Questions:  1. How long have you been on the Listserve and how long did it take before you were chosen/”won”?  2. What’s been your biggest takeaway so far from what you’ve read from fellow Listservers (Listonians?)  - As I’ve mentioned, I’ve only been here a month but just from that month, I’m already tossing around the idea of kidney donation and I’ve sent postcards to preschool students in the Netherlands. Pretty cool.  3. My two boys are ages 14 and 10- what’s your best advice for raising a teenager? The more specific,      the better- I’ve heard lots of “just let them be themselves!”.  4. Anyone have knowledge/experience they could share with me about building an online community   in Wordpress/BBPress  ?  - I’m building a brand new community for female fans of the New Orleans Saints and I’m running into sooo many technical issues.  While I’ve worked in online communities for years and could share tons of knowledge about engagement and relationship building, I’ve never built my own and I’m feeling clueless about some of the tech side of them.  2 people I think you should know about: Wish I could give you links to find out more about them but, unfortunately, URL’s aren’t allowed on ListServe. A quick internet search would find them if you’re interested in learning more, though.

  1.  Rockstar Ronan:  Yes, learning about a child that died of cancer is scary and sad but the statistics are even scarier and sadder.  For example:  46 kids EVERY DAY are diagnosed with cancer but it is still INSANELY UNDERFUNDED (at least in the U.S.) The National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) federal budget was $4.6 billion. Of that, breast cancer received 12%, prostate cancer received 7%, and all 12 major groups of pediatric cancers combined received less than 3%.

  THIS IS NOT OKAY!!! However, I have every confidence in Ronan’s mom, Maya.  She is going to change the world of childhood cancer. I urge you to join her.

  2. Steve Gleason:  His foundation’s motto is “No White Flags”. Learn about his fight against ALS – including a journey to   Mach Pichu (!!)  and you’ll see why that motto fits perfectly Favorite quote by Steve Gleason:  “I believe heroes take adversity or tragedy, turn it into opportunity, and  then share the opportunity with others, so the others can do the same. In a sense, we all have a chance to be heroes, to some degree. I’ve happened to have been dealt more adversity than most so the way I look at it, there is more opportunity for heroics. “

It's funny that as soon as you have ambition, other's success seems like an insult. Especially if that other's success is in the same field in which your passion lies. Maybe that's not funny. 

So why am I a failure? 

It's not because I've tried to be published and failed. It's not because I've tried to write for competitions and failed. And (given the fact that I make enough money to support myself, live on my own and am generally happy) it's not even that the incredible smallness of my troubles makes me feel so terrible.

And here's the best part! The best part; I had a great upbringing. I'm white and male. I went to great schools and am completely privileged. My biggest problem when writing? I have nothing to write about. No foster homes. No financial struggles. No, go-to true story of hardship that just rolls onto the page. I don't even have the moral position to even think of looking for pity from strangers because the thing that plagues me is so ridiculously un-pitiable. I am an antagonist! i am a bad person for feeling bad about the real and actual fortune that has led to this fanciful and gutless misfortune I feel! And I know that!

Isn't that just f*cking amazing! Ridiculous. I should be the happiest man alive. But I'm not.

So why am I really a failure? 

Because I know what I have to do to succeed.

I need to have the balls to leave a comfortable job and take my writing more seriously. I need to get off the damn internet and take a bit of control of my life. I need to stop being so damn lazy and actually do something about the one thing that I feel true passion for. I am a failure because I know exactly what I need to do to stop failing, yet I lack the courage to do it. 

I am a failure.

But maybe I won't always be.

When I was twenty I looked at my fifteen-year-old self and thought, ""so simple-minded!"" Now I look at my twenty-year-old self and think, ""so naive...""

In five years time, when I'm thirty, I'll look back at myself now and I know that I'm going to have similar feelings. I hope, however, that I will at least give my former self the same credit that I do now: he knew that he was still learning and that he always will be. He knew that by making mistakes, even if he didn't know that he was making them, he was going to get better and learn from those mistakes.

So, forgive your former self for the mistakes they made, and thank them for taking a bullet then so that you don't have to now. Excuse all those stupid things they said which upset other people. Forgive them for the financial decisions which left them feeling like a complete idiot. Let them off for letting that one jerk take advantage of them. They did it all in order to make you a better decision-maker.

---

Forgiveness is important for staying calm in life. I'm not a religious man, so I'm not preaching forgiveness for the sake of any higher power, but simply because in most cases, it makes a lot of sense. I'm talking about holding grudges.

Grudges are what happen when you let someone irrationally occupy your thoughts and and affect your actions because of some wrong they did to you. This includes the places you can't go, the people you can't speak to, the conversation topics that can't take place without their name coming up and making you upset. That all sounds like a lot of effort for little gain, and it's just not worth it. Most grievances are based on accidents or misunderstandings that got out of hand.

It's not easy, and I struggle with it as I'm sure many of you do. I think that trying to see the situation from someone else's position really helps. This, too, is hard. I recently read some advice: To better understand the argument of your opponent, try arguing their side of the story.

---

Those are a couple of things I have been thinking about recently: learning and forgiveness. I tend to overthink a lot of things, but being able to empathise is a skill I'd really like to be better at, so that's what I'm working on.

If you've read this far, thanks, and I hope that I've made you think a little bit. If you have any thoughts or comments let me know - heck, for all I know, in five years time I'll be all *for* grudges!

Now onto the self-promotion part of my email. I'm an Independent Software Developer, and I recently left my full-time job to pursue a little more independence. I've written about it on my blog. I am doing a little bit of freelance and contract work at the mo so if you need a JavaScript (front-end or server) or iOS developer, or whatever, maybe I can help?

I'm also a busker on the London Underground, and I've recorded some music. You can hear it on bandcamp, look for ""Dan Plus Add"". it's kinda nerdy, and kinda folky. I hope you enjoy it.

Finally, shoutouts. Jon and Alun: put your hand where your foot is. Happy 30th, Natty! As for you, Elli: you are wonderful, beautiful, funny and smart, and you fill me with so much joy and energy. Oeuf ou boeuf? <3

For some reason, this is surprisingly common. Because of that I'm not even sure if this e-mail will make it on. About 7 years ago when I was in the middle of applying to colleges I read somewhere that the best way to write a college application essay was just to free write (within topic of course!) for a specified amount of time and then go back and edit what you wrote.  This would create a genuine essay.  Not sure if that actually helped me get into college but I want to think it did.  I'm going to try and stick with this concept in this email.

Not all who wander are lost.  In the media, my generation (millennial) gets a lot of crap for not falling into place these days.   A lot of the criticism aimed at this group centers around us not getting and sticking with jobs.  Many of my friends, all recently graduated from college, have been bouncing around various internships and entry level jobs for the past 2-3 years just trying to find something that fits.

I have wandered in and out of many different jobs, activities, sports, and hobbies in my life and I’ve learned something valuable from each one.  Mostly, I’ve learned that if you don’t stick with something you won’t get good at it, but hey, that one takes a while to sink in. And sometimes, you just know when something isn’t right for you. Like ballet, that one probably isn’t going to happen for me (I was kicked out of gymnastics when younger due to lack of flexibility). Since college, I have grown less and less sure of what I want to do in life, in terms of a career. This insecurity isn't exactly comforting but it has opened my mind to a lot of new possibilities I hadn't considered before.

I think it’s ok that a lot of us are wandering.  Maybe more of us will actually end up in careers we enjoy and doing what we were born to do.  There’s bound to be a lot of confusion, anxiety, and failure before we figure out what that is.  It may not look like it right now, but I think we’re collectively onto something.  We’ll get there.  Just give us time.

Music Recommendations:

Ocean by John Butler- I was introduced to this piece a while ago and I still think it is one of the most beautiful pieces of musicianship I’ve ever heard- thanks buddy

Steeldrivers-really solid Nashville folk band

The Goat Rodeo Sessions: Yo-Yo Ma, Stuart Duncan, Edgar Meyer and Chris Thile

On that note, does everyone else think they sound absolutely amazing when singing alone in the car? I’m just really sure I sound amazing. Every other time I sing is just varying levels of stage fright. I will believe this to be true until I die.

Not the actual baking, that can be very difficult, just the fact that I love it. I don't find it particularly relaxing but it does make people happy and I have accomplished something tangible. I'm slowly working on learning to adjust recipes and make them my own and hope to be able to create brand new ones. My one rule/ piece of advice with baking is if the recipe calls for vanilla, always add a little bit more than it says.

If you aren't a big on making things from scratch but want something that people will love: I have made this a few times and it is well received.

That's really all I had to say. But if you want a little more here are a few things about me:

I live in Portland. It is a fantastic city. Not my favorite place on earth but certainly not the worst place I've been.

I love to travel. On my list of places to see are Thailand, Japan, Greece, and Scotland. I've already been to most of mainland western Europe, England (this is my favorite place) and Ireland. Though I do need to go again and this time bring my husband with me.

I love ""nerd/geek"" things. Or at least what a lot of people think falls into that category. Things like Harry Potter and Star Wars and Marvel and games made by Valve and Blizzard. I love playing Cards Against Humanity and Settlers and others. Also a huge Disney fan. I also spend a lot of my free time cross stitching or reading.

Hope I kept it fairly simple, interesting and fast. If you are also a fellow Portlander, let's trade some baking tips, start a book group or head out to geek trivia. :)

“The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation.

For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.”

December 2013,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/12/09/lessons-from-a-failed-founder/,"December 2013, 09",Lessons from a failed founder,"It’s been little more than a month since my startup failed and I had been working on it for 2 years.

Here’s some background: I was in pharma marketing and decided to quit my job and build an online travel startup.  Neither my co-founder nor I are technical people.  We put in quite a bit of our savings to do this crazy thing.

Here’s why I think we failed:·         We didn’t build a strong team.  Everyone was located all over the world and we never took the time to really get to know people.

·         We ran it too “corporate”.  Since both my co-founder and I came from the corporate world we had hierarchy and structure when we shouldn’t have.

·         Spent too much money, too fast.  We spent a bucket load of money on building our website and when we pivoted to a new, much better idea all I saw was all that money being flushed down the toilet.  Lean Startup made a whole lot of sense after that.

·         We could have been better hustlers (e.g. been more bold).  I think we both had personalities that didn’t really have the gumption to do what needed to get done.

·         We quit our jobs too early.  We should have continued working and built this thing on the side and once we saw growth, then quit.

·         We didn’t realize how convoluted the travel industry actually is.  We did tons of research before quitting but we were incredibly naïve about how complicated it was to get something going in an industry where fax is still a common tool for communication.

·         Don’t get caught up in the echo chamber.  I moved to San Francisco for my startup and it was easy getting caught up in opinions.  VCs think you should do this, other entrepreneurs think you should do that and all this is fed to you constantly.  We definitely got caught up in it.  Ultimately, it’s what your customers want that’s most important.  Nobody else needs a voice

·         We forgot it’s a business.  Especially with web startups, I see a lot of people think about money way too late.  We did that for the first version of our idea but remembered to think about the revenue model for our second idea.  Too little, too late.

If you guys have any questions about my startup experience or similar experiences to mine, let’s talk!

Fortunately, I’m not completely removed from the startup world. I get to look over my brother’s shoulder as he works on Lite Bite, a non-profit product.  In developing countries, dentists don’t have powerful lights to see in the mouth.  He and his friends created a low cost dental device that puts a light source directly into the mouth.  It’s 350% more powerful than the flashlights currently being used.  It’s a really cool project and if you want to learn more about it, I’d be happy to talk.

December 2013,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/12/08/beauty-connection-and-warmth/,"December 2013, 08","Beauty, connection and warmth","Dear people,

I love reading your stories. You give me the chance to share your lives a little bit. To me, this is very valuable. Thank you!

Me, I am a forty-year-old single mother, about to lose my job. Uncertain times. But by now, I do want to take life as it is. I also found out that I want to dedicate it to beauty,  connection and warmth. This is what matters most to me. Knowing this feels warm and sweet. So strangely enough, I have never felt happier.

I remember being a child and walking home from school. I passed a field where a girl was playing. She saw me passing and she started screeming something. I could not hear what she said, so I walked in her direction; she then came running at me. As she came closer, I heard she was actually insulting me. I didn't know her, she didn't know me, I didn't do anything to her, but still she started hitting me. I ran away.

This experience stayed with me. I could not understand why anyone would want to do this, and it was very difficult to accept my own powerlessness in the face of agression, hatred, lack of consciousness, or however you would want to call it. 

Over time I decided to withdraw from the world. I found a safe place to live in my mind.  It was a lonely way of living but it also allowed me to be close to beauty and far away from the violence and hurt I saw all around me. My body turned cold and I never felt very safe. Living like this had something very grey and meaningless about it. I connected to others in a judgemental manner. My mind was working hard to close off my reality for anything that could prove me wrong. 

At twenty I wanted to become more alive. I did all kinds of physical things, singing, theater, yoga, to become a bit less sterile. I had children. This opened up completely new layers within. To really inhabit the body is a long process but very worthwhile. It changes everything.

Eight years ago I started working in prison as a humanist spiritual counselor.  There I met very many loveable and soulful people. People that grew up in poverty, in environments which were not safe, with little love and respect. People with addicted parents. People who had to become used to unstable and unhealthy relationships and bad food. People who were so bored that they went on drugs as young as they could. People who spread violence and hurt in the world and were suffering.   

I also met many people in my personal life,  who were doing well in terms of jobs, safety and material wellbeing. But amongst them many who lacked somehow the ability to really care, about others, about the world, about beauty, about nature, about truth. They emit some sort of hardness and coldness.  

Slowly I learned to remain present more, and not to react to pain by stiffening or withdrawing. I became less of a victim of circumstances, and more of a creative force. Very nice that this is possible.

Now I want to use what creative force I have, to further beauty, connection and warmth.Beautiful things can happen between people. Nobody should go through life unseen and uncared for. 

My two kids say hi, I say: may you all blossom, 

I would love to hear from you,

All the best, JolandaThe Netherlands"

I just found out that I won the Listserve…5 days ago. -___- Shame on me. Thank you, Connie Chweh, for introducing me to the Listserve…yes, you should be jealous! I’m so proud of you. I’m so happy that you’re in my life. I love you.

After 22 years of existence, this is what my brain cells have to offer:1) Bullying happens because we let it happen. If you’re a witness to it, put a stop to it. We're basically bullies ourselves if we do nothing about it.2) Let’s finally shut up about our obsession with appearance and be satisfied already.3) “In three words, I can sum up everything I’ve learned about life: It goes on.” -Robert Frost4) I’m below average to poor in math, but according to my calculations, 99% of the time, life always works out. It may not work out how you initially wanted it to, and it may take A LOT of time and “bipolarity” (no disrespect), but it’ll happen if you let it happen and it’ll happen if you make it happen.5) Weird > Normal. Always. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. Ever.6) Besides a broken heart, there’s nothing more heart-breaking than loneliness. Since graduating college in June and starting a “big girl” job, I have experienced genuine loneliness for the first time. I know that I have people to go to when I’m feeling this way, but sometimes, I just don’t (Sorry, Connie…). Besides that one time I missed the e-mail about winning the Listserve, I’m pretty good about keeping up with my e-mails. If you’re ever feeling lonely, don’t hesitate to send me an e-mail. I know, STRANGER DANGER, but really, I would love to help. And if helping doesn’t go very far…or anywhere at all…know that I have rather large ears.

Would you mind answering these very 22-year-old questions for me? 1) What is *your* definition of love?2) I constantly wonder why we humans do things that make us so unhappy at times, even though we know we could die at any millisecond. How do you feel about this? How do you feel in general? What makes you happy? (Psychologist wannabe over here…)3) Favorite quote?4) Favorite song? (These rather large ears are desperate for new music.)5) My 23rd birthday is coming up…ish. How should I celebrate? How did you/others you know celebrate this mega milestone…not.

Would you mind doing some very 22-year-old favors for me?1) Please don’t litter. Maybe even pick up some trash when you see it? I know, EW, but trash that has been sitting there for aeons is more EW than taking a few seconds of your time and throwing it away. 2 words: Hand sanitizer.2) Please make someone’s—ANYONE’S—day today…or everyday. You won’t only make their day, you’ll make your day too.3) Please do something a little or a lottle different everyday. Your life will be filled with 365-times the memories.4) Please just tell me about yourself/provide me with some of that wisdom of yours/vent/anything. 5) Please be a good person. The universe needs more of those. 

If you’re anywhere near Fresno, CA, please send me an e-mail, so we can grab some grub and be friends. Thank you, Listservians, you’ve taught me quite a bit these past few months. I’m looking forward to reading your jackpot. Happy Holidays. I wish you all the absolute best. Hi, Dad. I love you too.

December 2013,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/12/06/good-grief-good-friend/,"December 2013, 06","Good Grief, good friend!","Grief. I knew I would write about this the day I signed up.

Despite the fact that 100% of people die, our culture ignores death or grief. When my father died suddenly at 59, I had no fucking clue how to be in this new world *without* him and *with* grief. At first there were lots of people, cards, flowers. Then everyone went back to their lives… and utter loneliness set in. I felt deserted, but now I understand that I wasn’t the only one who didn’t know what to do.

So here’s some “What to Do’s” post-funeral to about a year later, the darkest time, next you find your friend in grief:

----- Listen -----You can’t fill my void with words. Don’t tell me he’s in a better place, god has a plan, or any other cliché that sounds appropriate but really minimalizes my current, very real experience. He died. And no, this is not like the time your great-aunt died when you were three. Even the true stuff like ‘time heals’ doesn’t feel good to hear yet. You can simply say, “I don’t know what to say” and just be there. We can sit in silence. Or I probably have lots to say as I work through this: all kinds of sad, weird, dark, crazy, angry, contradictory, random stuff. Just be there, listen to me.

----- Reach out -----Don’t wait for me to reach out to you. Call me, when I’m lying in the depths of devastation and meaninglessness, it’s easier to answer the phone than to find one, figure out who to dial, actually do it, and hope they will answer. Randomly stop by, and bring a funny movie (and food!). Be prepared to walk away without hurt feelings if I just want to be alone (leave the food). Likely I’ll need the company and the relief. Just the fact you checked in on me makes me a tiny bit less alone.

But you have to reach out a lot, and let me say no. Don’t expect me to be ready to share my pain with you when you’re ready to be available to me. I might finally be feeling good for a few precious moments, don’t force me into a conversation about “how I’m doing with all ‘that’” just because you have an extra ten today and want to feel like a good friend.

----- Give -----Do the little things for me. I need practical help. Whether I am accepting it or not, my life goes on and I need to eat, fulfill some responsibilities, and take care of myself. The grocery store is unbelievably overwhelming. Why are there seven different kinds of EVERYTHING and which to choose? I can’t. It’s meaningless. Everything is meaningless. Why eat? Deliver me lunches, go grocery shopping for me, come fix me dinner, help me clean my space, take me on walks. I won’t think ask you for these things, but I need them.

--------------------It takes time. There’s no correct process or timescale. For me, years have passed and I’m happy and joyful again. I’m forever grateful to the few really good friends who didn’t disappear once the funeral ended. For the rest of my life I’ll miss my dad; what I like best now is reminiscing with family and old friends about him. The stories help him not feel so permanently far away. But he is, he died, and there’s no use ignoring death or minimalizing grief. Talk about it, be there, listen, reach out, give - don’t disappear. Love.

I have been thinking for quite a while what should I write in an e-mail addressed to the people of the world. I had some ideas, but none that I really liked. In the end, I decided on writing down some of my thoughts-realizations that are not certainly logically connected to one another. Those are nevertheless the thoughts that I deeply belive in.

First – everyone has some sad story. I have. And my closest friend, and my boyfriend, and my other friends. You, he and she as well. There are no people completely happy, everyone is afflicted with different problems in his life. Therefore, we should never judge other people easily, since we never know their story. Often people smiling the strongest are those with toughest past – but they belive in the power of optimism, they believe one should never give up and always have hope. They are right.

Second – happiness is a state of mind. One can have all the stuff in the world and be unhappy, one can be happy having nothing. It’s all about being able to appreciate beauty of this world and what life has to offer. Humbly accepting what comes along the way and being happy with every day, every little thing. When was the last time you stopped on a sidewalk, looked in the sky, realized how beautiful it all is, breathed deeply? Do it! Realize that you are alive, that life is a gift.

Third – there are good people in this world. We should never lose faith in others. Love exists, too. For many years I didn’t believe in love. For many years I thought it’s just some romantic fantasy from Disney movies. I lived alone, forcing myself to believe I’m happy – and then I met him. It was a complete coincidence, whim of fate, as if someone above planned it to happen. Everything went naturally and fast. All my ideas about myself turned out to be completely false. I believed I would never trust someone with all my heart – and I did. I believed I’m unable to love – and he proved me wrong.Some time ago someone on listserve has written, that love is easy, it just happens. He was right, it’s exactly as he said. And if there is love, no obstacle can stop it.My advice for the lonely – do not lose hope. Never. Never close your heart for other people – love will come, on its own, when the time comes. You will be completely surprised what the love really is.

Fourth – interests. Interests are one of the most important things in our lives. They give life colour. My love is reading books – I read a lot of them, of many different genres. It is said, that people, who read books, live twice. And so it is. Books always let me visit other worlds and experience adventures, moved me, made me happy, gave me laugh… I’m deeply fascinated with the world of fantasy, since it’s infinite, unbounded, with no constrains. As for me, it’s extraordinary and beautiful.

Thank you all for your time spent with my thoughts : )My text has been written at the last minute, but I hope there is at least one person who found it interesting. Also, I’m very curious what is your opinion on the topics mentioned and what is, in your opinion, the best book anyone should read?

December 2013,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/12/04/music-from-the-ice/,"December 2013, 04",Music from the Ice,"During the austral summer of 2008-2009 I spent five weeks at Palmer Research Station on the Antarctic Peninsula via a grant from the National Science Foundation’s Antarctic Artists and Writers Program. I was there to gather materials for a series of musical compositions inspired by Antarctic environments and ecosystems. Each day I set out from the station to explore my surroundings, make audio field recordings, and collect natural objects to use as musical instruments. If the weather was fair, and winds were below twenty knots, I hopped in a zodiac and motored out to neighboring islands or worked directly on the sea. In stormy conditions I investigated the glacier and rocky moraine behind the station.I often visited Torgersen Island, home to a number of Adélie penguin colonies. I was delighted to discover that the penguins had chosen a very musical island on which to nest, as Torgersen is covered in shards of a dense, sonorous, igneous rock. The Adélies gather the smallest of these stones to build their nests, but even the larger pieces were surprisingly resonant. As the penguins ambled along well-worn paths between colonies and beaches, the stone fragments clinked under their feet creating delicate melodies.The southern elephant seals were another one of my favorite subjects. I first heard them in a cove on Amsler Island. As we turned off the outboard motor and slowly drifted across the water, deep alien bellows emerged from the far end of the cove, echoing off the thirty-foot-tall walls of ice on either side of us. There, in the water, a couple of dark shapes tumbled and splashed. Several more massive creatures lay side-by-side on the shore. I quickly pulled out my pocket recorder, but after a few short minutes the seals’ outlandish calls ended abruptly. I returned numerous times hoping to find the “e-seals” howling in the cove’s sheltered waters, but instead I always found them piled up on the shore, fast asleep.Finally I decided to camp out on the island for a night. I waited for a window of fair weather and then, one balmy evening, was dropped off on Amsler a few hours before sunset. Shortly after my ride departed, I heard it: the faint bawls and bellows, splashes and sputters, of e-seals cavorting in the water. There were over a dozen, sparring in pairs in the shallow cove. I don't know why it hadn't occurred to me before that the elephant seals might be nocturnal. Suddenly it was very clear why they snoozed all day! In the long Antarctic dusk their playful martial dances and eerie roars were mesmerizing. I listened and recorded until, in the wee hours of the night, I could no longer feel my toes.Near the end of my stay I descended inside two crevasses on the glacier behind the station. From the surface the crevasses didn’t look like much, just ominous cracks in the snow, but inside lay ornate azure caverns adorned with thousands of icicles. Because it was summer and temperatures were above freezing, hanging on a rope inside a crevasse was a lot like taking a shower. First, I recorded just the multitude of water drops, and then I began to play some nearby icicles, cautiously tapping them with superball mallets. Lovely clear pitches emerged. Unfortunately, often the icicles fractured just as I started to get nice resonant tones from them. However, as they fell, shattering in the icy depths beneath me, they produced a spectacular mad-xylophonist cacophony, bouncing and echoing for a surprisingly long time.

Happy listening,

She didn’t wear her kerchief. The morning was light, airy, and blue. Green leaves hung heavily from strong oak branches, and cicadas buzzed heavily from within them, hidden. As Maya trudged over the sidewalk, her legs began to feel lighter and lighter.	Her walk was short, and took all of two minutes. By the time she arrived at our yellow house her legs were so light, she began to float. She was in the air; only by a few inches, but not at all grounded. With purposeful movements she opened the wide, white gate to our backyard garden and entered, closing it behind her carefully. She didn’t ring a doorbell or knock. No one, besides herself, knew where she was.	The garden had been watered that morning, and it was still early. Humid air was trapped below the greenery, giving the garden a damp, jungle-like feel.	Maya looked over the rows of shrubbery, and the assortment of flowers, and took up the nearby shovel. She started digging up the pink impatiens, then the large, leafy bleeding heart.	We, inside, heard the loud shoveling noise and gathered at the back window. Seeing her, we watched with a sense of dread. What was she doing? Under some spell, we didn’t think to go out and ask; we stayed in, observing, unblinking, chests pounding. Mom called Maya’s mom, told her Maya was up to something; that none of us knew what to do.	We watched as Maya shoveled with regular strong strokes, carefully piling the dirt to the side of the growing hole, which within an hour gaped. Clearly satisfied, visibly tiring, she sat in it and began covering herself; all except her hairless head. It stuck up, surrounded by dirt, severed flowers, and half-leaves. Then she began to yell.	“I need water!”	We heard her from our window perch, and so went to the backyard. Arriving at the site, we saw exactly what we had viewed from inside: Maya’s face sticking up out of the dirt. Like a flower, but pale, and plain, and beckoning. I grasped the handle of a watering can.	“Water me!,” she cried.	The water from the hose was cold. I ran some into the can, and then positioned it over her head.	“Yes!,” she said.	We all took turns watering Maya’s head, and she made clownish faces as the water flowed downwards, over her eyes which blinked and opened wide repetitively, over her mouth which spurted and smiled; over her pale, vein-lined scalp.

I needed money:,"I'm a nervous female undergrad engineer at the University of Michigan, and I have this thing. A business. It all started because of a bug and an unbearable need to straighten my teeth. [Skip straight down to the ASKS if you have no patience for my running mouth.]

It's the least sexy business that a student could start (sorry, no social network for cats or mobile app for dating, here.) but it works. And I love it. 

I find clients who need a little help optimizing their data management systems. Typically they are small businesses that I pass on my way to class or Chipotle. I get access to their excel spreadsheets and databases and convert the most redundant, messy, inefficient structures into gorgeously simple, automated files. This stuff gets me going (gets my customer's going too.)

I started this because 1. entrepreneurship is a bug on the U of M campus that just won't stop biting. Dude, it's completely normal for students to kick problems in the butt by STARTING things here (google MPowered Entrepreneurship). It's awesome.

2. I wanted to be able to pay for the good 'ol Invisalign treatment that I'm starting soon, instead of depending on my mom to pay the $5000 charge. Probably not the sexiest reason that should go down in history, but it's the truth. ( Invisalign is pretty sexy though. 3D scanners in your mouth when you least expect it.)

**______I don't see myself running a million dollar business revolving around excel spreadsheets when I'm older (Ha. Quote THAT in my biography when I'm 30 yrs old and running Excel Optimization LLC.) 

So far, though, I'm addicted to the late nights. The pivots. The 50 doors closed in my face. The 2 that open. It's an exhilarating education and I challenge all students, graduates, adults, children to take on weirdass side projects and simply...try things out; fail a little.

**______Anyway, I'LL END WITH A FEW ASKS:1. If you want to optimize your organization/business' spreadsheets and databases in 2 days, email me. 2. If you're from Amazon, Apple, any Airline company--or a supply chain-focused company in general--hire me for a summer internship. I'd like to jump on a 10 minute call asap to blow your mind.3. I want to know your entrepreneurial, self-starting stories, your side projects, your inspirations. I  think that we can learn from each other. Email me!

Thanks, Listserve family. It's an honor to write my thoughts here after reading for a year and a half. My young words of wisdom: please stop waiting and just go do it.

I'm in love with you all. See you around.

If you’ve only got a couple minutes to spare, here are some questions I want to ask you:

1.      What sort of advice would you give a young adult?

2.      What is your favourite book? (Movie, TV show, etc.)

3.      Where is the best place you’ve lived or visited? Most interesting adventure?

4.      What is a something I should learn how to do?

5.      If you haven’t got anything to say to the above, then tell me a story about yourself! Anything at all, don’t be shy!

Hopefully, that was short and sweet enough! I hope you’ll consider giving me a reply J

Now if you’ve got a bit more time on your hands, allow me to expand on the above questions.

1.      Nice to meet you! I am from Vancouver but am currently in Toronto as a second-year university student studying engineering, which means that yes, I am a young adult and yes, I am unabashedly looking for tips on life! I’ve no doubt that there are a wide variety of people reading this, and I wager a fair amount of you all will have lived and experienced more than me. So if you have any sort of advice at all, I’d love to hear it!

2.      I love reading. Love, love, LOVE it! One of my favourite book series’ is Harry Potter, which you might have heard of … it really inspired my love of books. I’m always on the hunt for new ones to read, so if you have a recommendation, please send it my way! Now, I understand that not everyone shares my joy, so if you have a particular movie, TV show, or even song you really enjoy, I’m definitely willing to expand my horizons.

3.      One of my wishes in life is to travel. Unfortunately, with my limited student budget, it’s a bit difficult at the moment, but I would love to hear your adventures. Having only visited a paltry number of countries so far (four … including Canada, where I was born), I would love to hear about some of your experiences, even if it just happened around the corner!

4.      I am always on the lookout to try new things, so I ask you this: has a random skill ever proved useful? Or even something I should learn to do every day that will somehow improve my life? I’d like to know!

5.      Stories. I like telling them, but I love hearing them more. Share with me any experience that you deem worthy – it may have been years ago, or it may have just happened yesterday! Whatever it is, I’m sure I’ll really enjoy reading about it.

That’s it! Thanks for taking the time out of your day from reading an email from someone you don’t even know – it means a lot to me! If this has caught your attention somehow, I’d love to get a response, and I promise that I’ll write back, really!

With that, enjoy the rest of your day (or night, as it may be)! J

Cheers,

November 2013,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/11/29/fluency/,"November 2013, 29",Fluency,"What I’m working on right now is fluency. My mother’s language, Hebrew, was my first language, I can speak it without an accent, and thanks to a year of high school in Israel I can discuss most things relevant to a teenager’s life, like schoolwork, crushes, and the political climate, with ease. But I’m not satisfied. What I want is to be able to articulate a thought, any thought, with as little effort as it takes in English, and at the same speed. When I want to write or say something in English, different ways to phrase it gently bob in the air in my head like balloons, waiting for me to pick the one I like best. But in Hebrew, choosing between different expressions of a thought is like trying on pairs of boots that don’t fit until one seems like it’s good enough for gardening (but not for going anywhere nice).

And I want to be able to read, for pleasure. In English I can look at a page and, letting my eyes rove over it briefly, grasp its gist and decide if I want to read it with care. When faced with a Hebrew page my eyes can rove all they want but until I decide, OK, now I’m trying to read, no meaning filters through. My eyes jump ahead to the end of a line when I’ve only read half of it. Are we there yet? No? What about now?

Here are the things I’m trying: reading aloud, to my mom, over Skype. Reading short stories or books with very short chapters, to quell my frustration with how slowly plots unfold. Stacking books around the house so I can glower at them defiantly. Listening to Hebrew comedy shows on youtube as a reprieve from the hard work.

Why does fluency matter to me? I’m not sure. It was once about connecting with my mom, but she recently crossed the threshold of having lived more than half of her life in the United States. Her English is good, and in Hebrew she was always gifted with language (prose and poetry alike), but when we talk she often seems stuck between her two languages: unable to find the word in Hebrew, unsure how to express the thought precisely in English, and no longer able to fluidly switch between the two as needed. When I offer her the word she’s missing, or quietly (but audibly) translate to Hebrew when she switches to English, I feel discomfort, and I believe I make her uncomfortable by calling attention to her limbo state. In trying to be a living vessel of that once-fundamental aspect of her being, am I honoring her? Or being selfish?

If my mother's country of origin were not a country perpetually at war, would language matter to me as much? I'm not sure about that, either. Though I think of ""language"" as definitely political, in that it describes and defines what happens in the world, it is also safe and neutral, in that it can create its own worlds (in one's family, or in songs, or books) that are separate and safe from the harsh ugliness of reality, unlike other immigrant longings like ""place"" or ""culture"".

My mother’s brother, who didn’t go to college, can’t read the books I also can’t read, and he doesn’t need to. His identity isn’t in question. Do I need to? Who exactly am I trying to pass as? Do I have the right to whatever self-definition I want? I think the answer to the last question is no. What’s more, trying to get to literary and intellectual comfort with a language is arguably a weirdly classist approach to identity. If my mother’s split-self is good enough for her, why am I, as someone who has the privilege of claiming a whole, unbroken all-American identity if I so choose, not content with what I have?

If you are not sure who you are, is it ok to try to define yourself through language?

If you’ve had a similar experience, I would love to hear about it.

Just off the top of my head (read: headache), let's talk about love. I'm sure everybody has experienced it all before. The cycle of butterflies to heartbreaks.

How it lifts you up and gives you hope, make each a day a little brighter. It's an amazing feeling. Sometimes, just the thought of that someone makes everyday more bearable.

But love changes. It changes you. Who you are and who you become depends in part on who you've loved.

Heartbreak forces you to visit all those deep insecurities you didn't know existed or didn't want to acknowledge. It forces you to learn about yourself and who you really are deep down. Many a times, you will not like what you see. But you cannot be blamed. You have to love yourself no matter what. Now you see why they say you have to love yourself before you learn to love somebody else? You cannot expect and put the burden on someone to mend all the broken parts of you you didn't know existed. The only thing they can do to help you help you discover them. Love you while you learn to love yourself.

You cannot make someone love you. You cannot stop loving someone just because they stopped loving you. Because that would mean your love was conditional upon knowing they loved you. You cannot force someone to love you just because you don't love yourself enough.

Our definition of love has been flawed by countless Disney movies and romantic comedies. Ask yourself what love means to you. And then ask yourself again what love really is to you if you didn't have those ideas of love you see everyday.

I'm no expert on love or anything. But I'm saying this is what I have learnt, so far. Maybe I have a lot more to learn and what I learn may change everything I think I know now.

I hope you all find that special someone and for those who have found that special someone. Hold on to them.

I'd love to hear what you guys' definition of love is. Feel free to buzz me!

I. LibrariansII. JFK, Bill Hicks, and historyIII. A note about the author

I. LibrariansAs far as I know, I am the second librarian-type person in Champaign, Illinois (the other was Nanette D., a librarian at the Champaign Public Library) to win the Listserve lottery. My friend who turned me on to the Listserve, Ellen K., is also a librarian-type person who has won the Listserve lottery, but she is no longer in Champaign.

I have worked in libraries, have a master's degree in library & information science, and am currently/desperately trying to finish my PhD in that field. I like to think of myself as a rogue librarian - I seek out or tend to attract confused-looking people on the street, in grocery stores, and, of course, the library stacks. And I love to help because that is what I see as the essential function of a librarian: helping people find what they need.

II. JFK, Bill Hicks, and historyNovember 22, 2013 is the fiftieth anniversary of the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 35th President of the United States. In the US and A this is a Very Big Deal. When I think of the JFK assassination, my first association is with the American comedian Bill Hicks (1961-1994), who said some pretty funny/irreverent things about that. He said funny and irreverent things about a lot of stuff, and I wish he were still alive to shepherd us through this sad and beautiful world.

I have a subscription to this magazine Texas Monthly, and like most mainstream periodicals it is a vehicle for advertising punctuated by the occasional article. Anyway, the editor felt the need to justify why “the national magazine of Texas” didn’t make JFK their November cover story. He wrote “Its many reverberations in American politics and society have been considered from every angle...The job of discovery and explanation has been completed.” I found this to be utterly fascinating, in that it more or less exemplifies the prevailing attitude toward the application of history specifically, and the (diminishing) role of the humanities generally. Ho hum.

III. A note about the authorI’ve been a Listserve subscriber for a while, and have wondered what I would say if I won. I came up with the content for this message just now, save for one thing: I long ago decided that if for some reason you want to contact me, I’m going to make you work for it. Sorry, it’s the librarian-cum-pedagogue in me. For that reason, I’m not leaving my email address in this message; however, if you conduct an online search for “Caroline Nappo” you will see results for a doctoral student/researcher at the University of Illinois (me) and a real estate agent based in Atlanta, Georgia (not me). Contact your local librarian for assistance if need be.

If you’ve read this far, thanks a lot. It turns out I do have one piece of advice. A dear friend says there’s only one thing you need to say to a pregnant person: “you look great.”

Very truly yours,

The 30 November each year, though not all too widely known, is known as self-harm/suicide-survivor Black Ribbon Day. If you see someone wearing a black ribbon, go up to them and give them a hug and tell them you're proud of them. Wear one if you feel you want to.

There's a lot of support out there even if you can't see it right now. I could tell you my story and it might make you feel sad. But the truth is, we've all had bad times, we've all struggled. So you don't need to know my story. But what I want you to know is that somehow, not through lack of trying otherwise this summer, I survived. I was with good people who cared about me, I saw doctors and was at hospital more than I wanted to be, and somehow despite the terrible things that I've been through, and despite how much I still hurt sometimes, I made it.

And you're loved. I don't know you, but I love you. I love that you're fighting. Even if you don't feel like you are, you must be if you're reading this.

Contact me if you'd like to talk, share a story with me, ask me things, share music, anything.

My favourite song? I have so many. My most listened to (according to iTunes) is Ludovico Einaudi's Snow Prelude No. 15. Check it out.

I never expected to win. I've only been on the listserve for a few weeks as well. It's strange how I'm not really sure what to say.

Now then, let’s get down to it.

I donated bone marrow last spring to a stranger who has since passed away. I do not know the name, location, or the details of when this individual died and I’m not quite sure how to deal with my grief over this. Maybe y’all can be of some help.

It was a few summers ago that I found myself sticking a Q-tip in my mouth and rubbing it along the inside of my cheeks.  A little cottonmouth and an odd taste was the result, and it was altogether not an entirely unpleasant experience. Though, it did feel odd to send it off in an envelope to be scrutinized instead of examining it under a microscope myself, as if it was some Freshman Bio lab exercise. Twice, I was identified as a potential match for someone needing to undergo a marrow transplant, and twice I was subjected to an intense phone interview followed by the resulting disappointment when my bones were not, in fact, the closest match.

It’s worth noting that none of my relatives had contracted a disease necessitating the donation of marrow or organs, not even a fecal transplant. So maybe my thinking was that I could be a hero for someone, a nameless person that swoops in and pulls you from the train tracks where you’ve fallen inexplicably or that stops a mugging. I could be Batman, except instead of fantastic wealth, hand-to-hand fighting chops, and gadgets to rival Q’s collection; I had exceedingly effective bone marrow.

Prior to my move from the East Coast to my current residence on the West, I got my third call alerting me to my potential match. After undergoing a blood test and a medical screening, I was cleared to donate. Those of you that are into travelling, look into donating if only for the free sightseeing. You probably won’t get the chance to take in many sights, but you’ll at least collect some frequent flier miles.

The hotel I was staying at, located adjacent to the hospital, used a golf-cart to ferry me back and forth. Surrounded by geriatrics getting hips, knees, and sundry joints replaced, I felt particularly healthy prior to having multiple liters of blood and marrow taken out of my body. I came to commiserate with the elderly when I was shuffling laps in the halls outside my room after the procedure.

It was a few months ago that I heard that my marrow recipient died. My contact with the registry took great pains to emphasize that it wasn’t my fault. I know that I did everything I could, but why is it that I still don’t feel like I did? For the length of time from my recipient’s “second birthday” to their eventual death, they had my blood (A+ in case you were wondering) and it still wasn’t enough. He was the closest I’d ever get to a brother by blood.

Hopefully telling this story to 25,000 perfect strangers will help me deal with this grief for the loss of someone I’d never met, never known the name of, and will never speak with.

Donating bone marrow is an incredibly simple procedure with no lasting consequences for the donor. Check out the Be the Match Registry or another registry if you’re willing. Feel free to email me if I could elucidate the process for you and thanks for reading this all the way through.

TLDR: Blah blah marrow blah blah donate some.

November 2013,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/11/24/no-subject/,"November 2013, 24",[no subject],"I have always had fear in life and I could never figure out why. Maybe its a personality issue. I have always admired fearless people who take the risk and bet everything on what they believe. There were times that I just wanted to have the guts to quit and follow my heart, but my Capricorn Moon never let me. My decision making process is more rational than emotional and that's something I need to learn how to balance.

I have always loved art. Art is my passion, is my home, is where I go to when I am down or up. Art never let me fall. I have released a book; produced one Theatre play USA and another in Brazil; I have had three painting exhibitions; I wrote a bossa nova song; I had an Art Channel at Youtube called Arte por Ai and a blog called The Art Reference (I know - I dont have focus!). But all of those projects were done in my spare time, as a second option, as a hobby. I actually work as contract auditor for an oil and gas company. I know, right? Crazy me.

However this year gave me a tremendous crisis. As for the Chinese characters, the word crisis means danger and opportunity. I began the year with a broken heart and destroyed dreams which were followed by family issues and now I am about to get fired. I have found myself in the last months duelling with those issues. But I have then made a promise to myself that whenever I find myself in a difficult moment in my life I would never NEVER make a down turn to a negative habbit like drugs, alcohol, smoke or depression. But I would turn to good things...even if I were at extreme... So I found my lovely shrink, meditation, yoga, sport and art again. 

This is stupid, but I also adopted the Jim Carrey's ""Yes Man"" movie concept for a month. In the movie, Jim says yes to every single invitation made to him and this ends up opening him to a new world. I did that for a month and I did amazing things and met amazing people. Stand up paddle; crazy trails; karaoke (believe me, I sing really bad); travels; cooking; political protests; slack line; organise a live music picnic;   And now I find myself in this moment: THE moment. F**k!Its just like that expression ""the train never passes twice"". If I dont catch it now the chance is gone. I am happy and also shitting my pants. 

I just needed to believe everything will be ok! And yesterday I was alone at the metro and, out of the blue, an old sir came to me and said: ""I've got to tell you something. I am sorry to disturb. Listen to others but also tell your truth. Release that energy inside you. Ok?"" To which I answered: ""Yes"" and he vanished.  I only needed someone to say it will be ok and that I am not alone!

I can say that I will tr... that I will make it happen no matter what!Thats a promise to me and a promise to you all, my Listserve friends!

So, feel free to follow my career and cheer, because I ought to find the necessary courage to make it rock!

Cheers from Brazil.Have an amazing end of the year and may 2014 come with an exciting World Cup in Brazil!

For those of you reading who feel a young adult’s opinions are invalid (you’re an age-ist basically) feel free to stop reading and go deal with your more pressing adult matters (go balance your check book or something!). But I think I have lived long enough to be able to comment on some of the imbalance I notice around me.  I have noticed in the past couple years multiple cases of black Americans getting killed in circumstances that would have been extraordinarily different if these people were white. Besides the obvious Trayvon Martin case, there was a 19-year old girl, Renisha McBride who was shot in the face when she approached a white man’s house after being in a car accident. She was asking for help and was intoxicated at the time. So yes this woman was drunk, and yes it was 1AM, but what century do we live in where a person would shoot and kill a young person who was asking for help? If a blonde white girl, like myself (minus the blonde), had approached this man’s house I don’t think there would be a second thought of him lowering his weapon and asking the woman what she needed; he didn’t even have to open the door, just talk through the damn window! There was another case of a white man following his black 14-year-old neighbor onto the boy’s property and shooting him dead because the man believed the teenager had stolen from him. The boy turned out to not be the robber.So America has now created a society where Stand Your Ground law allows anyone to arbitrarily kill whoever they believe has obstructed their safety. How broad are these assumptions and how can we not see that decisions are being made based on racial prejudice? It horrifies me to my core. Furthermore, most of the violence in America could be lessened if gun enforcement was readdressed. But even after Congress heard pleas from a Senator who had been shot in the head and grieving parents whose children had been massacred at their elementary school, they still failed to pass any restrictive measures on guns. There is some who argue that gun law won’t change anyone’s access to guns. I do understand the power of the black market and the fact that there are currently more guns in possession in America than there are people. Does this mean I should just sit back and come to terms with the fact that I live in an irrational, violent country? Well then I guess I will be asking for a one-way ticket to Sweden or New Zealand for graduation, because I’m not going to raise kids in a place where the people ruling the country are quoting bible passages and 18th century documents as a means of rationale. I know I have a lot to learn about life and experiences but there are some things that seem to me to be purely right and wrong. The paranoid, prejudiced, trigger-happy population that continues to make headlines have got to be the wrong ones.p.s. Shout out to Joelle Milman for being so funky and adorable.

The deeply fascinating thing about music is that so many people make it, that so many people feel compelled to create something and to share it with others, rarely expecting much in return. I am in many ways an introvert but with music I feel part of something, part of humanity. I engage with music every day. I go to record stores and learn from people who have been spending their lives exploring the deepest, most unlikely corners of musical creation. I dig through the bins by myself and wonder what I'll find this time and what hidden gems will pass me by, to be found next time or never. I go out at night and dance for hours, hearing songs created days or decades ago, manipulated by selectors shrouded in darkness, who don't need to be seen by a crowd to accomplish what they are there for, in a crowd of bodies in constant movement, energy levels rising and falling, but an atmosphere, a feeling in place that is eternal. There is no hope of leaving when the music is right, no matter the hour. In the words of Pina Bausch, ""Dance, dance or else we are lost.""

The voice of Ana Karina said, ""Il y a qu'à s'interesser aux choses et les trouver belles."" Records are things. Marvelling at the time, the effort, the work put into these acts of creation restores my faith in humanity every time I lose it. With music we connect with the past, the present and the future. There is so much humanity in a record, as you read in the liners notes the names of the individuals involved in the process, the vast majority of them long forgotten, living anonymous lives, yet you have in your hands something that they made, a testament to the fact that they existed and had something to share with the world. The wear on the jacket displays the years of use or lack of use, of care or lack of care. Whose was this, and what did it mean to them? Sometimes you find a message from a lover who made it a gift, and you wonder whether they're still in love, whether they're still alive. The scratches, the dust invade the purity of the grooves, visible and audible. As John Peel said, ""Life has surface noise."" You'll take this record home, play it for a friend, rock it at a party, listen to it naked in bed with your lover, show it to your children when they want to find out who it is that you are, were.

My sole musical recommendation: listen to Gilles Peterson's Worldwide on BBC6 Music. The man continues to dig around the world for beautiful sounds, whether they were made yesterday or made half a century ago. He taught me that genre is irrelevant if you really care about the music. If you want to hear my own selections, the sounds that I think the world should hear, listen to my intercontinental groove station, Minutes of Funk. You'll find it through @jeandreaux.

Shout out to those who create and innovate. Shout out to those who share creations. Shout out to those who try to really listen. Shout out to all people who have visions.

Space is the place.

Much love x

===noon, saturday, spring 2013: just watched 'a place at the table' with my class.

we got to talk to barbie, one of the film’s subjects after the movie, and she made me realize: hunger, homelessness, desperation, need- these are all subjective. she's right, each time we mention poverty we think of emaciated children curled up under the relentless african sun, haunting eyes against dark skin, a mother’s fingers fitting perfectly into the contours of her son’s ribs. but hunger is real and hunger is also here, right here, in rundown towns of the midwest and in food insecure belts without delivery of fresh fruit or vegetables. imagine living in a town where the only fruit available is a bunch of bananas on a grimy store countertop. one bunch for a whole town. imagine never knowing the taste of an apple.

and yet here, in new york: we strut out of whole foods glowing with pride. we carry brown paper bags full of organic berries, cage-free eggs, unsweetened milk, greek yogurt; we wear health-consciousness like a blue ribbon on our chest, thinking, we are better than chef boyardee’s, better than special k, jell-o, doritos, coke. and back home in singapore there are people who buy gold-leaf chocolate ladurée macarons for S$7.60 apiece (i never understood the point of this, the gold leaf is tasteless); they shell out for international food festivals, for french brunches and michelin-starred steak houses. this is how the students of today ‘hang out’- at fancy places like this.

and i’m guilty of it, too, i get excited stepping into a cafe with quaint decor, i think nothing of shelling out $3 for a starbucks mocha; i love brunch, pancakes, things that i can make at home i’d pay to eat at a place with fancy lighting and pretty furniture.

i’m sure we all know what are the things we shouldn’t ever take for granted, but we lose sight of them anyway. we’re all guilty of letting the appreciation of simple things fall in and out of the rhythms of our life. just go with the flow, they say. we’re not on the other side and we just have to make sure we never get there. in today’s world its every man for himself.

i know of people who make fun of americans by hiding behind the stereotype/ generalization that all americans are fat and lazy. look at the excess of the west, the east would say, in a tone dripping of self-perceived moral superiority. look at their portions. look at how much they consume, how unhealthily they eat. but as with every story there is an other side.

'a place at the table' tells us that obesity and hunger are closely linked occurrences— some people are overweight simply because the only foods they could ever afford were junk food— chips, cakes, doughnuts etc. in an ideal world mcdonald's would cost as much as whole foods and vice-versa, but the reality is that the cheapest foods are often tv dinners, canned processed foods, fried snacks, crackers. how else, then, do you expect someone on food stamps to bother about nutrition when they're already struggling to just put some food on the table?

knowing this breaks my heart.

i don’t know about you, but i’m thinking that as the world sets its table for each and every meal, it should make sure that there’s a place for everyone at the table.===

Semis were flipped in the ditches; visibility was less than a few feet. But our driver must’ve been on something that made all this crazy feel like paradise, because he didn’t waver. I thought I was going to die that night.

I sat next to a bearded Canadian, maybe 30 years my senior. An out of work electrical engineer, “just passing through.” We exchanged few words most of the way, passing the first six hours in near silence, white-knuckling the arm rests. But at some point, maybe we’d both realized that our fate was out of our hands, so why not lighten up, get to know our neighbor? We started up a conversation. I eventually asked him if he had ever seen anything he couldn’t explain.

Just like that, the question slipped out. It’s so personal, I thought, so eerie, and yet he didn’t miss a beat. He told me a story I repeat to this day, 15 years later, like I am right here. He told me that he was camping in Arizona, and as dusk approached, he realized he needed to hurry to find a spot to pitch his tent. He walked into the desert from the road, about a quarter mile, and turned a corner. There, he told me this so matter of factly that I have no doubt he saw this, was a deer, sitting upright, on a rock, legs crossed like a perfect gentleman. I immediately thought of the Gary Larson cartoon where cows are standing on two legs chatting, and a lookout cow shouts out that a car is coming and everyone resume their positions. The Canadian electrical engineer offered nothing more, and little surprise, really. To this day, I ask this question of people from time to time, and I’d love to hear your story.

Please reply with an answer to the question: Have you ever seen anything you couldn’t explain. If I get enough answers, I’m going to build a website as a sort of repository of your stories.

If you have 4 minutes, listen to Edward Elgar's Nimrod from the Enigma Variations, or Pink Mountaintops' While We Were Dreaming. If you have 8 minutes, listen to Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri.

If you have 50 minutes, watch Top Gear (UK); I recommend the 2007 Botswana special first (series 10, episode 4, available on Netflix). If you have around 80 minutes, watch the Duplass brothers' ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home"" or Mike Birbiglia's ""Sleepwalk with Me,"" both on Netflix (you can also listen to the latter on Spotify, which is just as great in audio format).

If you have an hour or so, read Antoine de Saint-Exupery's Le Petit Prince.If you have a day or so, read Chaim Potok's The Chosen.

An easy recipe that's a big hit at work parties for being a somewhat healthy appetizer is veggie rolls:Chop up 1 med. broccoli crown, 1 med. green or red bell pepper, and 1 cup carrots. Add to 3 oz softened cream cheese, 12 oz ranch dip, and 2 cups shredded cheddar. Spread thinly among 10-ct tortilla wraps and roll tightly, then roll tightly again in saran wrap. Let them chill in the frig for a few hours, remove the saran wrap, and cut into bite-size pieces.

November 2013,17,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/11/17/it-doesnt-matter/,"November 2013, 17",It doesn't matter,"This'll take about 5 minutes to read. So take a moment to stop, if you fancy a wander...

I was with my friend at JFK in New York, waiting to board the plane back to London, having had a holiday for a week.

Getting to the gate, there was a slow shuffle to the desk to board, and we came between a man and the back of the queue.

Pausing to see who would go first, the man said to us, ""after you...""

Without missing a beat, as my friend is want to do, he bounced back, ""don't worry... It doesn't matter.""

All he meant was, it didn't matter whether the man went first, or we did. We were all just about to get on the same plane and sit down for a good number of hours, so really, it didn't matter who went first.

What a thought!

I think it's the Zen nihilist in me that takes satisfaction in a universal state of mind, growing from the simple idea that 'it doesn't matter.'

'It', being everything. Not just the plane or the queue... everything.

Don't take this to mean, that 'it' doesn't mean anything, that things are unimportant. The world means a lot of things, to everyone including me. It just means, it doesn't matter.

I eventually found myself using it as a way to think about dying.

I don't have an issue with dying. I've experienced enough of it to not be scared of it. Well that's not true, I'm scared of pain, loss, suffering... But when I think about what it must feel like to die, or wonder what will happen when I die, and what happens next...I think...

Wait, it doesn't matter.

I came to a conclusion a while back - this is the nub of my email by the way -  that instead of thinking of our lives as states where we are alive (now) and one day we will eventually die (then), there is a simpler way of seeing it.

Consider for a moment, that you will always be alive.

In the way that you are alive right now. In this moment.

When we see time as something more than past/present/future, and see it as always 'now', just consider that you will always be alive.

Now consider as well as always being alive, like you are right now...you will always be dead.

You're dead right now. You - in the present now - will one day be in the present, dead.

When is the present? Always.

See it?

Maybe. Maybe not. Try it on for size again.

The state of living and dying exists in the same time: now.

When life and death don't matter, you can just get on with being in the moment. Forever.

If you've ever stood at a big jumping off point - a cliff by the water or a swimming pool board. There is a moment, when you may stand up there, contemplating the jump.

You know you're going to jump. You know how high you are. It gives you butterfly's in the stomach. You are in the moment. Exactly in the moment, alive. Whoa! What a rush.

But that moment - just when you imagine doing it...jumping off...but know you haven't actually moved?

Moving from being right there in the moment, to thinking about what is about to happen next, out of that present-feeling?

That's what we think about dying.

Dying is another experience, it doesn't fit into something we know.

We know we won't hit the water, or feel hitting the water. It's hard to grasp...trying to feel something that is EXACTLY about NOT being able to feel something.

Don't think of dying as jumping into the water from a height, full of anxiety, fear...wonder.

You are already in the water. You've always been in the water.

But you are also standing on the board, on the cliff. And you will always be standing there.

You are doing both, always. Forever.

This isn't a religious, or spiritual message. You may think it doesn't make sense. That's ok. Language is a terrible, clunky thing. You may probably think very differently from me, but then that's the point.

November 2013,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/11/16/overcoming-anxiety-panic-attacks/,"November 2013, 16",Overcoming Anxiety & Panic Attacks,"I thought long and hard about what the best use of my Listserve opportunity would be and for me the most rewarding thing would be to know that I've helped somebody. Even if it's just one person it will make it completely worth it. This time last year I overcame probably the biggest hurdle and something that would have seriously impacted my future. From the age of 15 I suffered with panic attacks & anxiety that made even the smallest of things an obstacle. For those of you that don't know what panic attacks are, they essentially occur due to your brain's inability to process information correctly at that particular point in time. They make you feel sick, dizzy and intensely panicky; like your whole body is working against you. What makes them worse is that they are invisible to anybody but the person having them and often come at the worst of times. It is important to remember that they don't necessarily come in high pressure situations, some people get them while riding the tube.

Personally, they made doing anything out of the ordinary a challenge. I didn't know where to seek help and didn't know how to stop feeling the way I did. At my worst I wasn't even sure if I would ever find a way to get rid of them. Now here's where I hopefully help at least one of you start to get over your panic attacks & anxiety. In the Summer of 2012 I experienced a few life events that would change my outlook on everything and change my life. At the start of the summer I met my favourite band and with that my biggest role model. This experience not only taught me that I could push past my anxiety and achieve things I never thought I could, but also that I shouldn't let my mind stop me from experiencing the most amazing things in life. During that summer I volunteered at the London Olympic Games, pushing myself further than I had ever done. During that experience I finally overcame my anxiety when I realised one thing; life is too short to let my mind stop me from experiencing all the amazing things the world has to offer. If you are sitting reading this and you are somebody who believes that you'll never be able to overcome your anxiety you just need to keep a few things in mind every day. You can ALWAYS take time and relax whenever you're in a situation you believe to be difficult. You are in complete control of yourself and nobody is going to think bad of you for wanting a few minutes of time. Always remember that what you experience can be overcome and it's far simpler than you think, it just takes a change in your perception of things. Remember that worry is a complete waste of energy, it doesn't produce anything. Finally, don't ever let your mind stop you from having a good time. Realise that life is short and you should take every opportunity as it's these experiences that you will always look back on. I'm 21 next Saturday, in my third year of my degree, have seen the most incredible things and have some amazing opportunities ahead of me. I'm proud to say that my life is good. I am happy.

Please feel free to email me or send me a message on twitter @jamiemaison anytime and i'll do my best to help, even if you just want to find out more about my experiences.

So what if you don't win, that's just the way of things. What really is frightening, perhaps, is the idea of winning and then never noticing. Having an opportunity presented to you that you missed and let pass on by. I almost missed the email that said I won, and now I'm a bit short for time. I'm no genius and I don't do anything spectacular, so I'm just going to spout out interesting thoughts on various things that I have thought about. I invite you to add your insight or disagree harshly.

Groups, especially who share common ideas, are probably one of the worst things in the world. If you want horrible things to happen, just get a bunch of like-minded people in one place. People say that they are opposed to organized religion, and I'm not going to say that that's wrong, but if you are you should probably also be opposed to activist groups, and even civilization itself. The number of people who have died due to nationalism or mob violence is absurd. 

If you take a point on a line at 0, and say that it will go either left or right randomly for each cycle, it follows Pascal's Triangle as far as probability is concerned. This may have implications in Plinko. 

Confirmation bias a(e?)ffects everyone. It probably will impact you personally in the next hour. See if you can catch yourself. Open mindedness is excellent and difficult.

You are probably not limited in intelligence or attractiveness. Both of these are very mutable, and we are conditioned to think otherwise.

GK Chesterton was a genius. If you've not heard of him, look him up.

Don't forget that you are fallible. You've probably made a few mistakes today already. Regret is seen as depressive in our society, but I've found that I can extricate myself from it when I consider what I could change about myself to avoid making similar mistakes. Mayhaps it is intended to be constructive.

Don't draw conclusions from any correlative study. Especially about cancer. Correlations are feelers for science, not data.

Discovering new things is still very possible, no matter how much you think science knows. We don't really understand simple things like sleep, and the lithium batteries in your laptop. Math too. The Collatz conjecture is really worth thinking about for some of your time.

Do things that are new, even if you hate them initially. Try messing with programming or math for a little while, see if you can solve some sort of a puzzle. Do something that society is opposed to- learn to pick locks or crack into computers. A dull life breeds dull people.

I'd like to know if I'm alone in feeling empathetically at a higher intensity than I feel internally. Tell me if you are like me in this way.

It is great to take irresponsible risks on your own time, when nobody will hold you responsible. Probably you should take only calculated risks otherwise.

Remember that people are entitled to their opinions, and they are not stupid if they disagree with you, especially on subjective matters. 

I don't think companies should have opinions. Even if everyone at Google is pro or anti-gay marriage, they oughtn't publicize themselves as such. It's an abuse of power.

""If you assume, you make an a** of u and me."" Shut up. This is incredibly untrue.

Please disagree with me, or extend my thoughts. Thank you!

November 2013,14,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/11/14/dont-get-married/,"November 2013, 14",Don't get married,"I'm against gay marriage. I'm also a lesbian.

Basically, I think getting married is a pretty silly thing to do, whether you're gay or straight. Historically speaking, marriage was a contract designed to pass ownership of a woman on from her father to her new husband (hence, her name changes from her father's to her husband's). But, if that isn't enough to put you off, there are plenty of other reasons not to get married.

For example, in most Western countries, social security rights are determined according to a 'breadwinner' system, where one member of the family is considered to be the 'head' and the others are awarded their rights according to their relationship to him. I say 'him' because, historically, only men have been considered capable of being breadwinners, this despite the fact that plenty of women are currently and always have been the sole or primary providers for their families. The extent to which this model applies varies somewhat according to where you live (e.g., it's pretty strongly applied in Britain and pretty weakly applied in some Scandinavian countries; here in France it's somewhere in between, but even in non-European countries with different histories of social security like Australia and the US you can usually find some version of the same story), but it's always there and it creates a whole heap of problems.

Marriage encourages people to be dependent on another, economically speaking: in short, for women to be dependent on a man. But what about divorce? Divorce rates have been increasing in the Western world for decades now (in the EU, for example, there's almost one divorce for every two marriages), and study after study has found that divorce makes women more vulnerable. This is often because women are almost always granted custody of children following the breakup of a relationship, and sole parenthood is really, really hard. It's also harder for women to be sole parents than for men, because they face much more discrimination, economic and otherwise. And there are plenty of other reasons too, but I've only got 600 words...

When marriage along these lines is applied to homosexuals, similar things start to happen: the partner with the lower economic power is made reliant on the partner with higher economic power, and then they get vulnerable, and if the relationship breaks up they're up shit creek without a paddle, if you'll excuse my turn of phrase. I don't understand why progressive homosexual people would want to put themselves and our community in that position. If anything, we should be fighting for the rights of ourselves and our heterosexual friends not to have to marry. We should be fighting for the benefits of marriage, such as tax breaks, couples' pensions, and so on, to be available without having to place one member of the partnership in a position of vulnerability.

So there are some good reasons not to get married, at least if you're a woman. If you're a man, it's probably a pretty good idea to get married, in that married (and even divorced) men tend to be better off financially than unmarried men do, but if you care at all about the person you're marrying, then you probably shouldn't.

There are plenty of other ways to celebrate your love for your partner: throw a huge party, have some kind of ceremony in a church if that's your thing, eat cake, go on holiday. All these things - the most enjoyable and, I think, most important aspects of getting married - can still happen without an actual marriage. Go for it!

November 2013,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/11/13/i-gave-my-kidney-to-a-stranger/,"November 2013, 13",I Gave My Kidney to a Stranger,"He was taller than me, a big guy – almost twice my size. He used to play semi-pro football before his kidney failed. He was charming, outspoken, the kind of guy that everyone in the neighborhood knows. He had the same initials as me.

I didn’t meet him until about three months after he’d been given my kidney. When I gave, I knew only that he was a “youngish male.” He’d been on dialysis for years; he told me that when the transplant coordinator called to tell him they’d found a match, he dropped the phone in disbelief. He never thought he’d get a second chance.

Why did I donate my kidney to someone I didn’t know? I’m a pretty nerdy guy, so in some ways, the answer is just that I read some articles and decided the benefits outweighed the costs: on one side of the ledger, laparoscopic surgery, a couple nights in the hospital, some weeks of recovery, minimal or nonexistent long-term health consequences; on the other, the near-certainty that I’d add decades to someone’s life, that I’d save them from brutal years on dialysis, save their family from the funeral of someone who died too young. It was the latter set of arguments that I could hear most clearly.

Another answer might be just that I wanted to do something extraordinary. I’ve been very lucky in life: I wanted to give something back. I’m no hero, truly no better than anyone else, but I wanted the chance to be heroic, at least once. This was my personal Mt. Everest. It was a way to put my mark on the world, to know that I had achieved something extraordinary.

If you’re reading this and are in decent health, you too could save someone’s life. Not just one person, in fact, but several: each year in the U.S. alone, three thousand patients have willing but incompatible kidney donors. One altruistic donor can trigger a domino effect of several more donations that wouldn’t otherwise happen. Typically these chains are five to eight pairs deep, but sometimes as many as thirty-six life-saving transplants can result from just one altruistic donor. I work for an organization, the Alliance for Paired Donation, who puts together these chains.

There are many reasons not to donate. It’s painful; your family probably won’t like it; there’s always a chance, however remote, that something goes wrong. But it won’t make you more likely to have kidney failure in the future, won’t decrease your life expectancy, and won’t be as uncommon a choice as you would think. Every year, hundreds of people each donate their kidney to a stranger, and more people will donate this year than last year, last year than the year before that. In the U.S. since 2001, altruistic kidney donation has increased almost fivefold. Moreover, organizations like the National Living Donor Assistance Center exist to make sure that no one is prevented from donating due to financial reasons.

Ultimately, whoever you are, whatever you do or have done, you personally have the chance to do something heroic, something that helps shape the meaning of your life by giving a gift of incalculable value.

Please email me at the address below if you have any interest in learning more about kidney donation. It’s not for everyone, but I hope that, for many of the people reading this, it’ll be a choice they’ll be proud to tell their grandkids about someday. I know that, speaking personally, it was the best decision I ever made.

I teach children from the age of 4 to 6. Children in this age group learn best by playing so that is what I’m helping them with. I can use your help as well, please read on! In my class we work with projects for about 6 to 7 weeks, we’ve had projects like the circus, the castle or the airplane. To start a project I always ask the kids what they would need to play, so I help them build, (life-size when you’re 4-6 year) airplanes, hospitals or the witch’s shack. You should see what we can do with glue and some cardboard!The children will then start to play, being the customs officer, doctor or any character that is suitable for the project. By playing inside the restaurant or the castle children develop their social skills but that is only the beginning.For the children the playing is very real and they take it quite serious, together we come up with ideas of what we need. We make passports, spell books, cookies or anything that comes to mind. Of course to do this the children will have to write, read, draw, measure or count, in other words, learn! On the other hand it is only just a ‘game’ so children won’t feel pressured or anxious to fail, they just need something to enhance their play and while playing there are no mistakes! Because you can’t make mistakes while playing all children can learn at their own level, some children really want to know how to write or do something while other just pretend to do so.Our current project is the mail, and for this we could use your help. In my class we have a stuffed bear and his name is Flip. Flip’s parents are currently traveling the world so for the time being Flip is in the capable hands of the children in my class. They play with him, help him and some actually see Flip as a real classmate. Flip goes home every weekend with a child. Flip has a little book and camera and parents can help their child to write down what adventures they had during the weekend. On Monday we read Flip’s diary. By doing so the children will get to know each other better, have a chance to show something from their home and have a little peak inside the lives of the others. As I mentioned before, Flips parents are traveling the world. That’s where you come in. It would be great if we could get postcards from all over the world sent by you/Flip’s Parents. Would you please send us something? A postcard, letter or anything else you can imagine would be great!It would be absolutely amazing if we would receive even just a few letters. Please write on the card where it is from so we can see where Flip’s parents are! Flips parents are called Ben & Sara. If you want to know how Flip looks you can Google ‘Flip de beer’ and you will find him.

Perhaps I’m starring on a reality TV show and don’t know it yet, but I find myself in a fair number of truly awkward and comical situations. I’m not sure if it’s my penchant for saying the first thing that comes to mind or just some karmatic effect from a previous life, but regardless, I’ve got a lot of good fodder for my future stand-up comedy routine.

My most recent I’m-pretty-sure-the-Universe-is-laughing-at-me moment happened last month when I was en route to what was most certainly going to be a break-up conversation. I was getting out of my car to meet my then boyfriend when I heard the distinct sound of fabric tearing. I looked down to see a hole in the crotch of my pants. The timing couldn’t have been worse, but it did give me a few minutes to laugh at myself before a truly unpleasant conversations. These things happen to me more often than I can count, but I have come to enjoy and embrace the comedic relief it brings to otherwise dull or unpleasant situations.. When I came out to my mom over dinner, she thought I was playing a practical joke for a while. Trying to prove that it wasn’t a joke proved pretty uncomfortable.

1) My favorite book at the moment is Nudge by Cass Sunstein. The book basically discusses choice architecture and how we can build a smarter planet to make up for the fact that we humans often make decisions that aren’t in our best long-term interests (think saving for retirement, eating healthy foods, climate change, etc.) If you’ve read Nudge or have an interest or experience in designing better systems of any kind, I’d love to hear about your work.

2) What are your awkward and comical stories?

3) I’m interested in how people work, particularly GTD and organizational strategies. Feel free to share some good advice/tips in this arena. I’ll also accept any life advice you’d like to give in general.

4) I work in fundraising/development, focused primarily in politics and the non-profit world. If you work in these fields, I’d love to connect.

5) Finally, if you know any single and awesome gay guys in the DC-area, I love awkward first dates. They make for the best stories.

Thanks for reading, y’all!

I asked her opinion what to share. I had no idea what to write and I’m not entirely sure that I’m closer a day later. Lately my camera has been a more effective means of communication.

She mentioned a few topics:Several involved Stephen King and his works/influence on everything. She’s a very big fan, but I am not.Then she mentioned I should write about the genius of John Carpenter, though I think Jason Zinoman’s Shock Value does it better than I can. Additionally, Jonathan Lethem wrote the definitive book on They Live.She did bring up a great question to consider: Why is it that while gay rights are making so many strides in such a short amount of time, the rights of women are being attacked and rolled back at a frightening pace?

I had the thought that some of the best writing is both personal and succinct. One personal topic I considered was my family’s immigration story but it’s just a variation on a theme. I will say that its given me empathy for anyone who comes to this country to start a new life (whether they are here legally or illegally).

Instead, I’ll briefly discuss my experience with Crohn’s disease. I was diagnosed with Crohn’s a little over three years ago after about ten days of not being able to eat. Essentially I would be hungry, but my body wouldn’t let me chew. I’d wake up in the middle of the night and need to take a handful of tylenol and antacids just to get back to sleep for an hour. I had to map out where every bathroom in the world was and prayed they were clean. All of this, out of the blue.

I’m lucky. I’ve been able to beat the disease back into remission, but it has given me this sense that I’m always on borrowed time until it comes back. The little bastard is always in the back of my head. A very personal reminder of my own mortality and what is really important.

Sometimes a high quality of life (whatever that means to you) is more significant than making a splash. I have no interest in disrupting the world at 41. Unlike twenty years ago, I don’t have anything important to say or write. No grand ideas. I’ve discovered what’s important: time with my son, a small collection of lifelong friends I can count on one hand, a beautiful and loving wife that I count among those friends, health insurance, a good book, a good meal, seeing new places. I’ve discovered yoga and think, despite my best efforts, it’s changing my life and who I am for the better.

Take from that what you will…

Some recommendations:BooksStretch - Neal PollackAnything by George SaundersTrouble - Patrick SomervilleA Gate at the Stairs - Lorrie MooreThe Coldest Night - Robert Olmstead

A final thought, we’re asked not to include hate speech here (and in many other places on the internet). Instead of preventing it, I suggest everyone allow it. When it’s driven into secret corners of the internet it can flourish and grow strong on its paranoia. Hate speech cannot survive when held up to the light of day. Expose it for the cowardice that it is by letting everyone see it and mock it.

I was just beginning to feel reconnected with the world. My business was having one of its best years, in no small part to my part-time assistant. Yet, despite the optimistic signs all around me – I was working as if the world would end tomorrow. Projects I wanted to forget for clients I wanted to ignore. My regular exercise routine was pacing between my monitor and the coffee pot. I wouldn’t leave my house for days at a time. My temper was getting short. I would explode at the slightest inconvenience. I was making my life and my young family’s life worse. Not better. I didn’t know how to stop.

In early August, two of my favorite people visited from half the world away and set up this block game in my suburban backyard. A simple game of 11 square wooden blocks and 6 wooden sticks. They were a little unsure of the rules – though they knew that 5 of the wooden blocks were placed on opposing sides, the larger king – placed in middle, and each side took turns throwing the sticks at the opposing sides blocks. The other parts of game play weren’t as clear. It didn’t matter, we played game after game after game for was seemed like hours.

Kubb – they called it.

A few weeks later I purchased my first kubb. Then in the middle of a mild, Minnesota winter, I invited a bunch of friends over to play for my 37th birthday. We joked about taking this silly wooden game seriously. We joked about playing competitively.

I pulled together two friends and entered The Loppet Foundation's winter kubb tournament. Outside. In February. In Minnesota. Walking into the tournament I remember saying to Jim, “there’s this one part of the rules I don’t quite understand.” He shrugged and we waited for our first game.

That first game lasted no more than 5 minutes. Same as the second. In those 2 short games – Jim, Jamie and I got a faint whiff of the game's bowling-esque short game and intense strategy. We applied our learnings as quickly and clawed our way into the Championship bracket.

After that tournament, when I had a hard problem on a client project – I’d step outside and throw some wood. Sometimes I’d play against myself, other times I’d practice some aspect of the game. A clear, focused mind brought a hit every time. Any other single thought guaranteed a miss. It felt like hours melted away. Yet the clock would say only 30 minutes. Sometimes 45. Always refreshing.

I slept better. I stopped drinking 2 pounds of coffee a week. My inlaws commented on how much color was in my complexion.

I thought my team was ready for the U.S. National Championship. We weren’t. We couldn’t hit anything. But we could hold on. If we didn’t lose immediately, we could hold on for a hour. A slow, painful slog only relieved by the tournament organizer calling time. Again we clawed our way into the Championship bracket. Again we lost immediately. Two long days in the heat of the Midwestern sun. Playing kubb. Nothing better.

Kubb is a simple game. No technology, no Internet, no Inbox. Just friends and family throwing wood across the lawn. A simple game that brought back to life.

THE WHITEST MAN IN THE WORLDLOVE RAP SONG

Like Hemingway drank his scotch,Like dogs who want to sniff your crotch.Like a mother who loves her babies,Like when the doctor told you didn’t have rabies.Like I only can love you.Like kids wasting the day on their Playstation Three,Like when you say “There’s nothing good on TV.”Like America loves its guns,Like when we watch Law & Order reruns.Like I only can love you.

Like Hillary still needs her Bill,Like when you cried from that waxing from Brazil.Like evangelicals love Tim Tebow,Like when we dreamed we’d go to the carnival in Rio.Like I only can love you.Like I only can love you.

November 2013,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/11/06/no-subject/,"November 2013, 06",[no subject],"Hi all,

In what I think is a Humankind Tradition, I raced to get this over to listserv, this despite the rush I got from getting the lottery email that made my heart race and put a smile on my face. The problem you see is recurrent, the natural flow of a busy life gets in the way of sudden opportunities, or small things and small gestures in a very quick mental calculation that guesstimates the amount of work needed for the amount of accomplishment and because inertia operates outside the physical world, sometimes going with what you have is the most likely outcome.

Now, I have mixed feelings about this, and I’ve had mixed reactions as well, mid through university - Computer Engineering - I realised I wasn’t really having the time or my life, and most importantly, I wasn’t accomplishing much, so in the course of a few months I made the decision to quit, during that process I started my own company and I went from there. A few years later, things were ok, we had a central office in Lisbon a small but very good team and the river was flowing, but a business opportunity came and we went for it, we nearly doubled the team size, we put a lot of money upfront to make sure the project would succeed, come 9 months and a baby boy later and the project failed, miserably at that, and I had some of the worst months of my life, between managing a snow ball of debts, managing family and close friends who had helped or had stakes in the business and everything around that.

At that point I decided that I would fix this The Right Way (tm) and got a job - while keeping the company open - with one of the best IT companies you could work for in Portugal. For a few years I laboured and split the money between myself and my growing family and the debts that I set off to payoff, and fell back in the flow. Come three years and another baby boy :) and amongst the usually linkedin avalanche of generic recruiter emails, one caught my eye and it pointed to Dublin Ireland. For two months we created spreadsheets, we made plans, scenarios, we looked at maps and cost of living and finally we rationalised a decision we had already made, and the four of us got on a plane and flew over to Ireland - a country we had very little knowledge about.

A year has gone, my two baby boys have grown and learned a second language in a way grownups can only be jealous about and here I am now, on The Summit conference making a decision on whether or not to follow up on an opportunity, an opportunity to reach a group of people who are open to reading what unknown humans decide to put out of their brains and I still have a conflict, I still have a hard time investing in something new and I still procrastinate in front of the computer instead of simply writing things down and assume the risk of failing and I still don’t have an answer or a system to do these things, but then again, I look back, and through pain and joy, I realize I made decisions that aren’t compatible with procrastination or sticking to what you know, and I don’t think I can rationalise that very well :)

Anyway, I don’t think I can make a deep introspection here or give any generic advise that would be helpful to anyone except that yes, as we all know, risk is part of human nature - as is rationalising - but consider at least that taking risks is what you do with the future and rationalising is something you do with the past, and with that in mind, don’t mix the two too tightly, you really don’t know what’s going to happen :)

Thank you all, I hope I managed to make some sense amongst the sudden introspection I DIDN’T set out to do :)

Cheers, love to all

November 2013,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/11/04/an-eye-for-an-eye/,"November 2013, 04",An Eye for an Eye,"A few months ago my boyfriend, Alexander, pulled a fairly elaborate prank and convinced me I had won The Listserve lottery.  I wrote a satirical piece on the superfluous things in this world that I love and hate.  After submitting my masterpiece I eagerly waited for its distribution to the masses.  A few hours after my submission I received an email from what I presumed to be The Listserve indicating that my piece needed some editing.  The email referred me to an attachment with suggested revisions.  A bit confused by the situation, I opened the attachment to find a presentation documenting each step of the hoax with colorful commentary provided by my boyfriend.

On Monday, I received yet another email claiming I had won The Listserve lottery.  I immediately assumed this was another, albeit uncreative, attempt by Alexander to prank me yet again.  However, after an email exchange with one of The Listserve's co-founders I was able to confirm its authenticity. This time it was the real deal!  My initial thought was to submit the love / hate piece I wrote as victim to the aforementioned prank.  But then, it hit me, this was my chance at retribution!  The interweb gods were giving me a chance to do unto my boyfriend as he had done unto me.

So, fellow Listservians, I humbly request your help in assisting me in paying it forward to my lovely boyfriend.  I ask that you send him an email at  with the content of your choosing – the more obnoxious the better, but a blank email will also suffice – and title it “It is what it is”.

For those of you interested in what I originally intended to submit, I’ve provided an abridged version below.  Please feel free to email me for the full length.  For those interested in seeing the presentation that set the wheels in motion for this post, send me an email as well.

** Things I Love and Hate (Abridged Version)**

1.   Gelato (love) – For a period of time I was taking down two to three cones per week and would occasionally indulge in a full pint.  I’ve come to realize my love for the cold, creamy goodness has entered an unhealthy territory.  The solution – to open up my own gelateria and fully embrace the obsession.

2.   Pandas (love) – Pandas are amazing because they’re (i) ethnically diverse, (ii) peaceful, bamboo-eating vegetarians and (iii) have a level of dexterity comparable to humans.  I also own far too many panda-related articles of clothing (hats, sweaters, tanks, etc.), which is irrelevant to why pandas are awesome, but completely relevant as to why I am.

3.   2Chainz (love) – 2Chainz is not a rapper, but rather a poet that speaks eloquently against a high tempo backdrop.  The only rapper even comparable to 2Chainz would be Gucci Mane, not for his ability to create thought-provoking rhymes, but because he has a tattoo of an ice cream cone plastered on the side of his face (I’ve already established why that would merit high praise in my book).

4. Skele-Toe Sneakers (hate) – Feet are ugly enough on their own, so why wear shoes to further accentuate the ugliness of this appendage.  I’m convinced that anyone who owns these sneakers has no friends or family, no strong desire to procreate and lacks any semblance of respect for themselves or other humans.

5.   Oysters (hate) – I’ve eaten enough oysters to know that anyone who says they like them is probably lying and should not be trusted.  They have a gross, gelatin-like consistency and taste like a hybrid of saltwater and earwax.

My gift to myself was to lose 30 lbs, which wasn't easy. It was however possible, and I don't know why I didn't discover that until now.

I read somewhere that your twenties are about figuring out what you want, and your thirties about working hard to get it. If I had truly believed in the importance of sustained, focused effort earlier in life I would have disagreed with this. I would have spent less time thinking about the person I would like to be, and more time doing the things that he would do. It doesn't count if it stays inside; see also faith vs. works.

Things I can't resist saying to 25k people:

* I asked the most creative person I know what I should write, and she said to tell people not only are there repercussions for being a douche, but for not being a douche, and to tread carefully.

* If you can get over the quirkiness, mewithoutYou's 2009 album may resonate with you as much as it does with me. It's all crazy, it's all false, it's all a dream, it's alright.

* I just re-read my favorite book, The Broad Highway. At this point I've read it so many times that I don't even know if it's truly a good book, just that my dad shared it with me as a young man so I like it. Best selling fiction book of 1911. Check it out.

* I'd love to hear from you how your culture and language celebrate birthdays. I'm American, but living in Holland I expect to hear a lot of ""gefeliciteerd met je verjaardag"", literally ""congratulations with your birthday"". We'll likely be sitting in a circle eating cake and drinking strong coffee.

* What is one thing I should do/see/visit/eat while I'm in Europe?

* What have you accomplished that you didn't think was possible?

November 2013,02,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/11/02/,"November 2013, 02",!,"1. This is my oldest sister’s favorite joke. Elena, you wonderfully silly adult-person, this is for you:

“A man is driving his car down a long gravel road. Suddenly, a wide-eyed hare jumps out from behind a bush and our driver is unable to stop before flattening the poor little guy. Distressed, the man begins to cry. A car pulls up behind him and a beautiful woman steps out, pulls a spray can form her purse without a word and sprays the hare from head to toe.The man watches in awe as the hare jumps to it’s feet, hops a short distance from the car and turns back to wave goodbye. It continues hopping, stopping, turning and waving until it disappears into the distance. The man asks, “What on Earth did you spray him with?” and the blonde, reading from the can’s label replies, “Salon Hair Spray; brings life back to dead hairs. Adds bounce and permanent wave instantly!”

2. Talking point: Despite being a lazy, barely-semi-bilingual Canadian who sometimes even struggles with her native English, I think the whole idea of language is pretty neat. I am particularly interested by the way that different languages have words and concepts that we just can’t quite capture in our English lexicon. For instance, in French “Tu me manques” translates loosely to “I miss you” but more literally to “You are missing to me”. To me that gives the impression that the people you love, whom you miss, are essential components of who you are or who you have become. Sweet, no? All in all I’m truly lucky to feel that way about my goofy friends and my big, hilarious family.

That being said, here’s my question for you lovely, diverse worldwide Listservers. You know that feeling when you’re about to finish a particular thought and suddenly someone else, a friend or a stranger, finishes your sentence better than you possibly could have? It’s sort of a neat and momentary connection with another human being. Do you have a word for that in your language?

3. Hi guys! Isn’t this neat. I hope you all are having a nice day. Maybe the sun is shining where you are, or your sandwich is particularly tasty. All I know is, your hair looks great the way you did it today. On this end, I’m a 21-year-old student living and playing in beautiful Vancouver, BC.Likes; peanut butter and jam pancakes, Calvin and Hobbes comic books, big happy dogs, travels, all of the outdoors everywhere, this band called The National, strangers who smile at you.Dislikes; the sound of other people chewing. Honestly that might be it.

I sometimes wonder where grown-ups are supposed to make other grown-up friends. At the bar? On the street? I’m not entirely sure. It sure seemed easier when all our moms just organized the playdates for us. Well, I’d sure love to hear from whoever of you has a moment to write back. I’ve always wanted a pen pal, and from what I’ve read you all seem terribly interesting.

Cheers.

October 2013,31,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/10/31/on-time-and-traveling/,"October 2013, 31",On Time and Traveling,"I received the notification that I'd won the Listserve lottery less than half a day into my weeklong Maui vacation. Since I don't bring my laptop on vacations if I can help it, I'm writing this to you from my iPhone. I'll proof as well as I can, but please forgive any typos.

Apparently, a 3 hour time difference is harder to overcome than I thought. My boyfriend and I went to bed at 7:30 last night because we're wusses and caved to the fact that we'd been up more than 18 hours. And now I'm awake at 5 am.

Time differences are one of those things that freaks me out a little bit. It boggles the mind to understand that time is relative and has very little meaning outside of that which we assign to it. But our whole society is based on this arbitrary concept, and we constantly feel the pressure of it.

I'm the sort of person who hates being late to things. In fact, I arrive stupidly early to most events (I often find myself walking around the block a few times so I'm not half an hour early for a doctor's appointment), and it takes a bit of mental effort to be ""fashionably late"" to parties. I wonder why humanity first felt the need to divide and label time in such a structured manner, and if our collective inability to imagine time as anything but a straight line with little tick marks every month, year, century, millennia, would prevent us from ever being able to time travel.

Anyway, I think that travel is one of the few pursuits that really highlight the absurdity of time. I think it's a tragedy when people structure vacations as just another to-do list: we have to hit this and this today and these other 5 things in this order at these times before we leave or this trip is a failure! Maybe that's a peculiarly American approach to seeing new places (since we always seem to go about things backwards), but as an American myself and a fairly uptight and rule-abiding citizen in my day-to-day, I approach traveling as a chance to, cliche though it may be, live in the moment and take what comes my way. I don't always succeed, but I think it's the effort that counts.

Time, our schedules, our plans... They're all arbitrary anyway. And that's a good thing.

October 2013,30,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/10/30/i-love-you/,"October 2013, 30",I love you,"Hi there--hope you're doing well. Like everyone, you're trying the best you can to find peace and happiness, and you have a natural, inborn dignity and sanity that has nothing to do with the ups and downs you go through.

So I love you, and very best wishes to you in your life.

Relatedly, if you don't like yourself, that's really unnecessary and holding you back. Try to imagine yourself the way you were as a four-year-old child--that person just wanted to be happy, and the idea that he or she might not be enough or be worthy never came up. That sort of self-acceptance hasn't gone anywhere in you; it's just gotten clouded over by a lot of pain and complexity. You can definitely find it again, and you deserve it.

Other than that, I wrote some things I wanted to share:# Questions# Recommendations# Plug

--# QuestionsThese have been really important for me in my life. Obviously, I have my own strong opinions about them, but I think just asking them might be helpful.

-What can we work toward other than pleasure? Pain and pleasure come and go. My life is generally happy at the moment, but I know many of the people reading this are having a very difficult time; and, of course, my life has felt painful and deprived at other times, and will again.

We can't rely on pleasure. So what should our goals be? Should we just roll the dice and hope we're happier than we are miserable? Or is there a kind of happiness or fulfillment that isn't affected by the ups and downs of life?

-Who doesn't deserve to be happy? Picture a person who you think is terrible--a personal enemy, a dictator, etc. Now ask: If that person could be happy (without ruining others' happiness), would you wish that for him or her? If not, why not? What goal or principle does that person's misery serve, and does our wishing it come from a positive or negative place? Is it ever valid to celebrate another person's suffering?

-How stable and sensible is our notion of a self? I know I am alive and aware--but who exactly is it that knows that? Who’s aware of the sense of ""I"" itself? Is ""I"" aware of ""I"" itself, or is the sense of ""I"" something that comes up in a larger space? If the latter, does that space still have a particular name or identity?

# RecommendationsHere are a few things that I truly love, and hope you might too:

-Buddhism. The kindness, sanity, and wisdom I find in the Buddhist path have formed the basis for my life. I'd be happy to discuss my experiences and recommend books and other resources if you're interested.-Jazz. I play jazz piano, so I'd recommend Brad Mehldau as an absolute colossus in jazz. Look for ""Mehliana"" on YouTube for him on keyboards with an amazing drummer, Mark Giuliana. They were in Boston last night, and it was easily the best show I've ever been to.-Entrepreneurship. If you're highly competent and can tolerate risk, nothing I've found is as exhilarating, and nothing matches the pace of learning.

# Plug

-If you're interested in meditation, please check out my business, Medivate. It's designed to help people make regular meditation a habit. It's free, and has a meditation timer, meditation log, goal tracker, and a lot else.

Lastly, I love you to my parents, and to Clara.

I like to laugh and want to be happy in this life. I would like to share something I came across in some random email that I read often and strive to live.

Remember these five simple rules to be happy:

1)    Free your heart from hatred.

2)    Free your mind from worries.

3)    Live simply.

4)    Give more.

5)    Expect less.

In my life I also strive to live the Plan of Happiness, which would be my #6.  I told my husband (who is also a Listserve subscriber) that if I won, I would share one of the biggest things that bring me happiness.

6)    Living the gospel of Jesus Christ.

I believe that I am a child of God.  I have a Savior who is Jesus Christ.  He knows me personally and better than I know myself.  He knows my trials and struggles in life as well as all my joys and triumphs.  He wants me to be happy. Most of all he loves me.  I am grateful that he died for my sins so that I may one day return back to him.   I know that families do not have to go to “death do you part”, but that we can be together for eternity.  This knowledge brings me peace and joy.  We recently lost a daughter in January and I know that we will one day be reunited with her.  I know that a 14 year old boy named Joseph Smith prayed to our father in heaven and received a personal witness from him and our Savior not to join any other churches and that the  fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ has been restored today on the earth through him.  I believe in modern day prophets and I know that President Thomas S. Monson is the living prophet in our day who leads us and guides us today.  I know that along with the Holy Bible that the Book of Mormon is the true word of God.

Yes, if you haven’t already guessed I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  Living the Gospel of Jesus Christ brings me the most joy and happiness as well as serving others.  If you would like to know more or have any questions, please feel free to email me.

I am passionate about learning. I think the mind is a muscle that requires exercise in order to be healthy and strong. My father lived to 88 and enjoyed nearly 30 years of retirement, largely, I feel, due to his insatiable curiosity and desire to learn new things.

Four years ago as an adult I started playing the cello. It’s a surprisingly difficult instrument to learn to play well. And music is endlessly complex, with layer upon layer of nuance and meaning to ferret out and understand.

I have what I call an “infinite list”. This is the ever growing list of things I wish to learn or experience. The content of the list is less important, I feel, that having it and having the desire and drive to keep tackling new topics and new experiences.

Colleges, jobs, lovers, projects, friends, towns, countries, you name it. I would have quit the planet if Mars One had been ready yet. This isn't the part that makes me especially proud.

It’s like Brewster’s Millions and I’m the Richard Pryor of quitting: I have a certain amount of Quit to spend each day or I’ll lose it. The turning point for me was discovering that I could chose, in advance, what to quit and not be forced to meet my quota in regrettable meltdowns.

Quitting isn’t bad in and of itself. Huh. I can’t tell you how freeing this realization has been. I mean, I have become such a good quitter that it’s possibly my superpower--and who wants to relinquish a superpower? No need to when it can be harnessed.

I searched for things to quit. Didn’t have to look far. Turns out many habits are well worth quitting anyway and take a quitter’s grit. I focused on habits that *I* can’t easily moderate, that--no matter how much I enjoy them--addict me. Everyone would have a different list. Roughly in this order, I've quit:

 * TV * Tobacco * News * Alcohol * Marijuana * Caffeine * Porn * Masturbation * Sugar * Carbs * Processed Food

Not everyone can or even should be a quitter, I suppose. But it's worked for me.

How does it feel? Rad, yes. It’s no magic bullet, but I am much more comfortable being just me right where I am.

What do I do with the extra juice? I enter waking dreams as often as possible: by playing with kids, by drawing, and by reading and writing fiction.

If you’re not getting the mileage you want, why not embrace your inner quitter?

Next up on my Quit List:

 * Buying New Things * Making Trash * Taking It Personally * Being Quiet About It

I’m taking suggestions and I’m curious: What would you quit?

Cheers,

MikeBerkeley, California, USA

P.S. - My science fiction and slice-of-life short stories are out there as ebooks, if you’re into that kind of thing. Here’s to keeping quit."

My favorite email was from someone who was moving and wanted help finding a new place; for some reason it amused me.Few things about me are I live in Seattle but miss Portland, moved for family. I love ice cream which is not too suprising considering Seattle and Portland are both in the top five for the consumption of it. Going to be an aunt in April and can't wait to meet a nephew named after Game of Thrones; now I will have to watch the show.   I often feel like nothing important or exciting happens that is worth mentioning but life really is about that perfect cup of coffee or a good moment and not all about the big things.My best friend Erin and I are making bitters for the first time. Giving it a go but anyone have a great recipe? Back to the ice cream. As I hate eggs, anyone have an eggless ice cream recipe they would reccomend? By baby brother introduced me to football and now I love it. A big reason I love the game is how it helped connect me to a brother fourteen years younger than me. This season I'm playing fantasy football and its fun to compete against friends yet after the season I'm going to need my mouth scrubbed out with soap as I like to loudly vent my frustrations.

Thanks, Lita Seattle, WA

P.S. I hate watching football in October with all the pink on the field. Just wish the NFL would donate money to breast cancer and stop harassing my eyes. "
October 2013,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/10/24/24hrs/,"October 2013, 24",24Hrs,"My colleague, Kuan, wants to put a hit on me. The fact that I joined Listserve less than 10 days ago and won the lottery, has gotten his sense of justice out of whack. He feels wronged - Kuan: sorry buddy, you'll have to find a way to get over it.

I was not prepared for this. I have not gathered any life lessons here - I'm still putting together the list that I can hand over to my kids. I will recount however what I would consider the most exhilarating time in my life. Here goes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I walked up to the gate agent and handed my passport. Could not contain my excitement - when the plane landed in Toronto, I would be entering my new home. I was migrating to Canada from India - a place I'd visited a couple of times but didn't really know much about. I was just turning 21,starting my Master's research at Concordia University in the fall - life was going to get a whole lot more interesting. I was overwhelmed with excitement and anxiety - I'd never spent any time in the western hemisphere and that too alone.

I knew something was not going well when the agent frowned - passed my papers around to a few others - checked the computers, all the while giving me furtive looks. In short, I had stayed out too long and my residency papers had expired, they could not let me go through. All i could hear in my head was a big FUUUuuuuuucccccKKKK! An end to the ride - my pessimist side did the whole ""I told you so… it was too good to be true""…. etc. I guess the agents took pity on the look of utter panic on my face. They were going to request London authorities to see if they would grant me 24Hrs in the city, goto the Canadian Embassy and work this out. The walk to the agent was the longest in my life - again I worked the whole sorry face and he allowed me into the country.

The fact that I only had a $100 with 24hrs to face in London complicated matters. Here's how that went. British Airways came through with a hotel, the concierge armed me with 3 maps to get to the Canadian High Commission. $80 left when I got to the embassy, convinced the guy that he had to let me in - double sorry face - paid $60 for a photo and application - came out with $20 in hand.

I had 1 hour to get back and make my flight - I only had a 12 hours permit to enter Canada. The Ritz, Bond Street, Buckingham Palace, Hyde Park, Paddington Station, Piccadilly Circus  - my mind was blowing up. Imagine if one day you woke up and were in Harry Potter land and it was real OR a 6 year old in Disney Land. That is how I felt. All the stuff I had read about in Wodehouse, Shelock Holmes, the news - they were all real. Sooo cooool! Every little detail from the sights, to the sounds and the smells from that experience are etched in my mind. Swore I would be back.( I did - ended up living there for a year later in life).

Needless to say I skipped all food and still had $10 when I boarded the flight - one that 24 hrs before I did not think I would ever make. Learnt a few lessons though. If you care to read it is :

1. Don't take NO for an answer. You can always find a way to negotiate.2. You can make any amount of money work for you.3. If you want something - put yourself in front of it and carpe diem the heck out of it.I've kinda lived by these till now.

Thanks if you actually read to the end.

October 2013,23,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/10/23/lets-get-complicated/,"October 2013, 23",Let's get complicated,"Mechanical timepieces make me happy. I own a couple and even fiddle with some of the mechanisms. I have screwdrivers, tweezers, and a spring bar tool. It's a very rewarding hobby.The primary function of a timepiece is only to display the current time- hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds. Make it easy to use and simple to read. Anything extra is called a complication. For example, a date or a moon-phase indicator may be added to a watch. My favorite complication is the chronograph.

Chronos=time, Graph=writer. King Louis XVIII liked horse racing and commissioned a gizmo to be made that could tell who won and by how much. The contraption that was built drew a line on rotating disks, the shortest line won. This evolved into today's chronograph. A writing on time.

The primary function of a chronograph is to time of an event. Basically, it's a stopwatch- Seconds. Minutes. Hours. Start. Stop. Reset. It's a power-hungry add-on built for specific use-cases, like timing a race or pasta. It draws power from the mainspring, so it has to be lightweight so as not to effect the primary function of telling time. The accuracy requirements can also be very stringent- some chronographs can time an event to 1/10sec, and faster. The time and the chrono should display without conflict. It's a beast built to run in very tight constraints.

I've recently been working on a fairly large project for work; my part is larger than I am accustomed. My little mechanical buddy has been there to keep me focused on the larger project while building out our piece. Next time, we can talk about the GMT function on a watch, I'm going on a trip.

Have a great time today. :)

It might be an engineer who is able to design a system sensitive enough to analyze the surface chemical content of a star 3 billion light years from earth but not quite able to detect the yearning of his spouse for a loving gesture. Or it might be a CEO who has the stamina to relentlessly and passionately pursue company objectives but routinely misses opportunities to encourage, engage, develop and orchestrate the work of his subordinates.

We all come to work every day with a unique assortment of problems and aspirations. Sometimes the problems get in the way of the aspirations. My job, as an EAP counselor, is to help move the problems to the side so the aspirations can flourish. In my work I try to make a difference in the ongoing drama of elation, disappointment, achievement, loss, bravery and stress that occurs at the intersection of work and personal life.

I have been following The Listserve community for quite some time now and I particularly value the extraordinary generational, cultural and geographic diversity found in the posts.

I would like to use my turn to communicate with the group to ask you to help me better understand what I have spent most of my life trying to understand. I try to understand what motivates people to work hard and feel good about their efforts and what discourages people and makes them give up. I try to understand how good bosses bring out the best in people and how bad bosses drive people to despair. I want to know how individuals, right now in 2013, are dealing with the trade-offs and conflicts that are inherent in the pursuit of making a living, finding meaning and achievement in our work, and having a fulfilling personal life.

So here are a few questions:

What has been your experience with bad bosses and wonderful mentors at work?

What motivates you and brings out the best in you at work?

What discourages you most in your job?

What have you experienced and learned about working with others?

What are your strategies for balancing the demands of work with those of your personal life?

I write a blog called stress.health.business. I would love to include some of your thoughts on any or all these questions in one of my future posts. Feel free to make up your own question about work (and answer it please).

I would love to hear from you and I promise to let you know if your wisdom and experience get featured in my blog.

Good luck to you all in finding answers to your most important questions.

Make It Relevant.,"As your thumb hovers about the ""delete"" button in your email, I ask you to read just a few more sentences of my email. I want to talk to you briefly about two things.

First, the Chewonki Organization. (Chewonki? What does that even mean? Is that a word? Only one way to find out-- read on!)Second, systemic racism. Chances are, you haven't been taught about it. Not your fault, just statistics.

So, what is Chewonki? The Chewonki organization is based in southern coastal Maine and has numerous programs to connect people with their place in the natural world. I attended the Chewonki Semester school, meaning I spent 4 months of my junior year living and studying with around 50 students and faculty in Wiscasset, ME. That semester was undoubtedly the most influential time of my life. The close-knit community taught me so much about my place in the world, hard work, my relationship with nature, and who I was. Chewonki has become an integral part of my soul.

Students live in cabins with ~7 other people and tend to their own wood stoves. They help on the campus's farm (alongside the absolutely amazing staff). They take amazing and rigorous classes with the best teachers I've ever had the honor of learning from (coming from two of the most ""prestigious"" schools in the country). They will meet the most amazing students imaginable from across the country. They will laugh like crazy. And when it's over, they will cry. 

I ask you to think about whether you know any young people who could benefit from Chewonki. I'm not trying market them-- I honestly hope that each student can have access to the amazing opportunity that I did. Applications to the program are due in sophomore year. There is financial aid. If someone you think could be interested isn't the right age-- check out their camps. A quick google of ""Chewonki"" will take you to their site immediately. Even if you don't know anyone, just look at the pictures :)

Second, systemic racism. I hope that after reading the following links you gain some insight into just how present racism is in American society today. It's less blatant than it has been in the past, but its current form of manifestation is much more toxic in my opinion. I believe that if you are in a privileged position, it is your responsibility to educate yourself about the systems affecting oppressed people, so read up on it.

I know you're a lot less likely to read these because I can't include links-- but just do it. Copy and paste the next few lines into Google and read the articles they link to. If you really read them, they will change your life:

1. The Invisible Knapsack of White Privilege by Peggy McIntosh-- good intro to the concept of ""privilege"" in a non-economic way2.  28 Common Racist Attitudes and Behaviors (the URL should be from St. Cloud state)-- this is by far my favorite resource3. The Four Is of Oppression YouthBuild -- this will give you a good understanding of how oppression works and why ""reverse racism"" doesn't exist.

Thank you to the too-fantastic Julia Dornbusch for showing me the list serve (she also went to Chewonki with me!!). Infinite love to everyone from Semester 48-- you made me who I am.

I'm a college first-year from Boston currently attending Columbia University in New York City. I play rugby. I like anti-racism work and feminism (and the intersection of those two things). I like education reform. Let me know your thoughts.

October 2013,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/10/19/reflections-on-teaching-with-a-broken-face/,"October 2013, 19",Reflections on teaching with a broken face,"In 2005 I stepped into my first classroom as an official high school English teacher. Having survived the usual trials and tribulations of student teaching, non-invasive background checks, and a lengthy Los Angeles commute (is there any other kind?), I was thrilled to get to teach students in my classroom a la the tradition set for me by Hollywood. I was going to be the next Jaime Escalante or that lady from Freedom Writers. Of course that’s not really how things went down.

My first day was, to say the least, challenging.  I was 22 and had 21 year old students. My first period class had 43 students and I had a few tarnished tables and chairs to seat maybe a dozen kids. There was a hole in my floor that went to who-knows-where. And–oh yeah–I couldn’t move half of my face.

A day before I started teaching I found out I had Bells Palsy. Basically, the right side of my face was paralyzed. I couldn’t blink (I was a really good winker), raise my eyebrows, or move that side of my mouth. My speech was bordering on lispy/drunken belligerent as a result. When I smiled it looked Frankenstein-like grotesque (look in the mirror and try to smile with only half of your face).

Fortunately, Bells Palsy wore off after about a month and a half. But that first day was one where superficial moves like smiles and normal eye contact were thrown out the window. And yeah, the school I taught at had some dilapidated challenges too: the conditions my students were expected to learning (did I mention the mousetraps behind the bookshelves?) were not only less than ideal but downright unjust.

I made a lot of mistakes and learned a lot that first year. I learned that the tremendous love, resilience, and hunger for an equal education can make any space ignite with the possibilities of learning. Engaging with my students and being honest about my weird looking face meant my classroom began with a culture of openness and honesty.

The world of education in the United States has a lot of work to do. Nearly a decade after that first day of teaching I’m now helping prepare future teachers for classroom life. It’s a strange shift, sometimes. I build from my experiences looking out an unblinking right eye at a decimated classroom filled with eager students and strive for helping revolutionize the world of education.

As every Listserve member out there has, I've toyed with what would Iwrite, well the time has come and now I'm undeniably overwhelmed.  Ithink I always knew I wanted to put some piece of advice, notnecessarily assuming everyone would follow, but in the sense that thispiece of advice was most helpful to me and it's my email, so let's doit.

But, before I get all ""self help book"" on you, I'll give you a littlebackground.  I'm in my final year of college, and like everyone onthis earth, I'm incredibly busy.  Rather than listing my achievements,and having you gauge just how busy I am,  just know that if there wasa way to never sleep thus providing endless time, I'd be the firstperson to sign up.   Biggest fear right now? I will graduateunemployed.  I'm terrified of not having a job.

Now that I made myself relatable, let's get all advice-y.  In no wayam I attempting to convince you of what you should or should not do,I'm just sayin' these things really stuck with me and have made adifference.  If for no other reason, I'm just sharing my story, feelfree to think ""shove it"" and not take any of my words seriously...

The best piece of advice I ever received was during a big interviewprocess I was going through, someone who had gone through it in yearsprior came up to me and said ""Don't worry about what everyone else isdoing- that's way too exhausting and will get in the way of you doingyour best"".  It really resonated with me and I try to apply this to myeveryday life.

I think I'm done now, because none of you have time or areparticularly interested in having me send some long email.  So withthis, I'll give a quick shout out to Tim S., he's  gem and a half andintroduced me to the Listserve.  If anyone in life is going to goextremely far, it's this kid.

Have a great day and remember,

I'm not going to write another lengthy meaning-of-life e-mail (ain't nobody got time for that). Instead, I'll share some little unrelated things that I enjoy and make up most of my life. If you really don't have 5 minutes to spare, I included a ""too long; didn't read"" at the bottom (but come on, make an effort ;).

(I'm a 27y old web developer from Belgium.)

Time-travel! Oh how I love this stuff. Be it the concept of traveling back and forward in time, discussing the grandfather paradox or simply devouring the internet in search of good books and original ideas. These things can keep me quite busy! Once in a while I jot down a concept or interesting point of view that pops into my head. Maybe I should write a novel about it someday, we'll see. All in due... time.

Boardgames! If you're someone who enjoys boardgames and would like early access to a new website I'm developing (it's still all secretive and hush-hush!): hit me up on Twitter! The project (codenamed 'Boki') is still in it's very early stages and could very well take some years to complete. Nevertheless I can guarantee you will fall in love with it if you're somewhat into board-gaming!

We continue! Boy oh boy what a roller-coaster of an e-mail this is!

Movies! TV-shows! How do I put this? The only thing that takes up more of my time then watching movies is reading about said movies and finding out everything there is to know about them. Checking up on blogs to watch the latest trailers or to read an interview with an actor or actress I like is part of my daily routine. There's almost nothing I like more then watching a movie with friends and afterwards discussing the whole thing for hours on end whilst enjoying a good beer.Speaking of beer (I did mention I was from Belgium so the beer-talk is mandatory): If you're a beer aficionado you should try and get a hold of my current favorite: Gulden Draak (""Golden Dragon""). It's a strong, dark Belgian beer and there's nothing like it really!Where was I? Ah yes, movies! Being a compulsive list-maker I even started a spreadsheet with movies and shows I've seen. Complete with dates, keywords and personal score (oh jeez, I know...).If you want to exchange thoughts about movies or would like to share your favorites, be sure to send me a tweet (@wouterdebr). My personal all-time favorite is without a doubt Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (2004). Check it out, it sucks you right in!

Bringing us to the last part, for which I will need your help: Twitter action! Since most people enjoy random social interaction I thought it would be a fun idea if you could all grab your cellphones right now, pick a random date between today and say the coming 3 years, and schedule a reminder to send me a tweet (@wouterdebr) or an e-mail. You can write about movies, belgians, time-travel, or things completely unrelated to this e-mail really, the choice is up to you!I look forward to receiving those messages on the most random of days and will try to reply to all of them!

TL;DR: I'm Wouter, a Belgian guy (yay! beer!) fascinated by time-travel and way into the movies. Tweet me for anything that's slightly related!

I am NOT an expert, but I'd love to share some tips with my millennial brethren in need (although I suspect that the demographic of the listserve includes very bright people who may not need them). However, if any good comes of this, that is my goal.

Brand Yourself:

1) Have a great social media presence. Needless to say, all of your social profiles should be clean and professional. Social networks like Twitter enable communication with high-up industry people that may not otherwise be accessible. Use this as an opportunity to network. I have met many people in real life from Twitter relationships. In fact, my second (current) job was offered to me because of my participation in a ""Twitter chat"" and the resulting relationships. Do not be afraid to contact people on LinkedIn. It is expected. Connect with everyone you meet as well.

2) Blog! Regardless of your industry, blogging helps to establish authority, showcase writing and thinking ability, shows internet-saviness and much more. I've heard people tell me that they have nothing to say or they don't have the time. Trust me, it will help. Even if you paraphrase industry news or write about your favorite TV show, I believe it's worth it. A free WordPress blog is fine for getting started. You should ultimately buy your own domain. They cost ~$10 a year and are a worthwhile investment. I received this advice through informational interviews I was participated in prior to graduation and feedback from my first position indicated that it impacted my candidacy. Also, Triberr is a good website for bloggers. Get on it!

The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood by James Gleick -- Spans the history from man's first records, through Turing and Boole, up to the ubiquitousness of information on the web today, and even touches on quantum physics. Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson is an awesome historical fiction companion.Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter -- Recursion for recursion's sake.Cosmos by Carl Sagan -- Perfect for thinking about our place in the universe as the inhabitants of a little blue dot of a planet.Time Enough for Love by Robert Heinlein -- Fun stories, free love ideas, space cowboys.

Similarly for music:

Ys by Joanna Newsom -- Clever and impactful lyrics, meandering epic poetry.The Lion's Roar by First Aid Kit -- Melodic Swedish folk duo. Sisters!Music for Two by Bela Fleck and Edgar Meyer -- Virtuosic jazz banjo and string bass.The Waiting Room by Lusine -- Beautiful ambient-ish electronic to groove to while working.Moment Bends by Architecture in Helsinki -- Fun, poppy, dance-y. All of their albums are great.

Anyway, he is my stab at a decent listserve:

I work for the emergency services in the UK and so I thought I would share a few 'inappropriate 999' calls with you all:

'my online shopping has not arrived...' Really. I mean how is this a 999 call? Unless you have ordered life saving blood plasma I am hanging up right now.

'there is a cat in the street. It is meowing. It's owner may be hurt....' Oh come on. It's not fucking Lassie. 

'there is a dog barking. It's owner may be hurt....' Jesus Christ. The dog may be Lassie but we no longer have wells which people fall down. 

'There is a family of ducks crossing the road.....'. Are you seeing a pattern here? We Brits are a nation of animal lovers. We in the emergency services take a sterner view. Mamma duck will have to take her chances. 

'I am drunk, can I have a lift home from the police?'. Sod off.

If you were in denial about your dysfunction, how would you know it? If you identify with much of the following, called the Laundry List - 14 Traits of an Adult Child of an Alcoholic, then you may have learned dysfunctional coping strategies as a child that you carried with you into adult life.  These coping mechanisms are the laundry list traits below. Note that alcoholism is only one of many possible ""family diseases"" that can create abuse and neglect.  Other addictions, mental illness, sexual abuse, extreme religiosity, etc., can also produce adults that identify with the Laundry List. The Laundry ListWe became isolated and afraid of people and authority figures.We became approval seekers and lost our identity in the process.We are frightened of angry people and any personal criticism.We either become alcoholics, marry them or both, or find another compulsive personality such as a workaholic to fulfill our sick abandonment needs.We live life from the viewpoint of victims and we are attracted by that weakness in our love and friendship relationships.We have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility and it is easier for us to be concerned with others rather than ourselves; this enables us not to look too closely at our own faults, etc.We get guilt feelings when we stand up for ourselves instead of giving in to others.We became addicted to excitement.We confuse love and pity and tend to ""love"" people we can ""pity"" and ""rescue.""We have ""stuffed"" our feelings from our traumatic childhoods and have lost the ability to feel or express our feelings because it hurts so much (Denial).We judge ourselves harshly and have a very low sense of self-esteem.We are dependent personalities who are terrified of abandonment and will do anything to hold on to a relationship in order not to experience painful abandonment feelings, which we received from living with sick people who were never there emotionally for us.Alcoholism is a family disease; and we became para-alcoholics and took on the characteristics of that disease even though we did not pick up the drink.Para-alcoholics are reactors rather than actors. Recovery from dysfunction is manifested through self-love, emotional sobriety, and serenity. It literally means to grow up, to go from an adult child to an adult who is a child at heart. I have been in recovery for nearly five years. My coping strategies were to isolate and daydream, to blend into the background and become invisible, and to extract love from my family by disappearing.  Deprived of the attention I desperately craved, I unquestioningly accepted abuse and humiliation as the price of being included and learned to deny the terrible feelings that accompanied them. So naturally my biggest fears have to do with being visible, the center of attention, and appearing in any way different from those around me.  In recovery I have come to love and value myself. I have found the courage to be myself, to hang in there and ride out the bad feelings, and push back if someone crosses a boundary.  I increasingly know and accept what drives me. I can deal with uncertainty. If the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of changing, google ""adult children"" and take it from there. Break the cycle!

... and rebuild it.

Forgive the hyperbole. You see, I've found that people are more likely to pay attention when you shock them a bit. I can't tell you how many times I've had this conversation:

Me: ""I want to change the world.""Random Acquaintance: ""Oh, that's great! I work with this organization that supports rights for the oppressed people of Fuckedupistan. We're having a rally on Saturday -- you should come!""Me: ""Oof, sounds great, but unfortunately, that's the same day as my rally to support rights for the oppressed people of Evenmorefuckedupistan.""RA: ""Oh... well, that's okay. You can just sign this petition and we'll put you on our mailing list!""Me: ""Sure, but you have to promise not to actually send me any mail. I get 78,426 messages a day, and I can't miss out on those penis enlargement opportunities.""

Yeah, yeah, I know. Hyperbole. Fortunately, this *exact* conversation hasn't happened, but you get the idea. We all have a finite amount of time and energy, and I believe we have a responsibility to use it in a way that will create the greatest positive impact. For me, that impact doesn't result from attending a rally or signing a petition.

When I say that I want to change the world, I mean it. I'm not talking about saving the whales, or fighting childhood obesity, or protecting workers' rights. Those are simply causes -- important ones, no doubt -- but in the end they're just small pieces of a larger puzzle. I prefer to look at that puzzle holistically.

A premise: Western-style capitalistic society, as it exists in 2013, is directly or indirectly responsible for a significant proportion of humanity's ills.

If you disagree with my premise, or are just waiting to be convinced, I would be happy to have that discussion with you -- just not right now. (And not with 20,000 of you. Oy vey, what am I getting myself into!?) This assumption can't be easily proven in one 600-word e-mail.

If you do agree with my premise, however, then I have a request for you.

It is my belief that capitalism cannot be cleanly ""extracted"" from human societies without leaving those societies in a (temporary) state of chaos and panic. You remove it, violence ensues, people die, etc, etc. Far from ideal. Instead, what we need is an alternate system to which people can migrate, one by one, until a critical mass is reached which causes capitalism to become quietly irrelevant.

I would like to build this system. I need your help to make it happen. If what I've said resonates with you, e-mail me with the following information:

1. Describe yourself. This is intentionally open-ended; you can say as much or as little as you like.2. If you were like Bruce in Bruce Almighty (he basically becomes God), what's the first thing you would do?3. (Optional) Search online for The Venus Project and read/watch to your heart's content. Then tell me your reactions.

What am I going to do with this information? Honestly, I don't know yet; it depends on the number and content of the responses. 20,000 should be a decent sample size to at least get an idea of how the general public reacts to this sort of rhetoric; beyond that, all I have is a bunch of ideas and a burning desire to implement them.

But I promise you this: I'm not going to sit around and watch the world suffer needlessly. I hope you don't, either.

October 2013,10,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/10/10/thoughts/,"October 2013, 10",Thoughts,"I am 24 years old and live in New York. I am interested in Medieval Hebrew manuscripts and early printed Hebrew books, which is a bit of an obscure interest. (It's really fascinating stuff though! Check it out.)

I am trying to figure out my next professional move and have thus been meeting with as many people as possible to get various perspectives. One specific conversation I had was particularly refreshing, so I wanted to share that with you. I was speaking to a PhD student, who told me his particular perspective and then concluded with the following: ""You have to talk to everyone, and then talk to no one, and think about what you really want, and trust in God that it will all work out.""

This sentence struck me for a few reasons. First, I often have trouble making decisions, so it was probably a good thing for me to hear that while other people's advice is important, it ultimately comes down to me. Second, I think it is sometimes important to realize that as much as you plan, some things are beyond your control, and everything will not happen exactly as you had envisioned. That's obviously not to say that you shouldn't try. But still, it's probably a healthy thing to keep in mind. Third, I thought it was cool that he mentioned God. I grew up in a religious environment, so that is certainly not a foreign concept to me. But even so, I have found that few people actually talk about God. There is plenty of talk about religion itself, about community, about values, but somehow God sometimes gets lost in all of that. So I was kind of impressed that he threw that in - we had never met before, and he did not know me or my religious leanings, but he still felt comfortable enough to invite God into the conversation. Made me stop and think for a minute, which is certainly something I don't do often enough.

What has made you stop and think? Something that happened, something that someone said? Definitely doesn't have to be on the topic of religion. Or, on an unrelated and lighter note, anyone have any fun/crazy/creative date ideas?

October 2013,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/10/09/f-cancer/,"October 2013, 09",F*@& Cancer,"As I write this email, there is a battle waging in Texas that has far reaching implications.  The State Board of Education is deciding how to deal with evolution in their science text books.  Why do you care, especially if you don't live in Texas?  Well, Texas is a big market for text books.  A text book that can't be sold in Texas is not going to make money, so publishers write books that comply with Texas' guidelines, and then sell those textbooks nationwide.

What are they trying to decide?  If evolution should be challenged in text books.  I am all for rigorous scientific study.  I am an engineer and I graduated from one of the top science institutes in the US.  I am all for teaching students critical thought, we do not do enough of that.  But Texas is trying to hold up creationism (or intelligent design) as a viable alternative to evolution.  In the context of a science class, this is laughable.  If you want to discuss intelligent design, it should be discussed up as an easily disproved and non-scientific argument against evolution.  Teach that element of critical thought.  Using concepts like irreducible complexity or pouncing on slight anomalies in the fossil record is not enough to throw out evolution; a ""theory,"" that can and has been tested rigorously, and can be used to make accurate and correct predictions about the natural world.

Believe what you want to believe as a matter of faith.  But don't pretend that that faith belongs in a science class.  I am not anti religion, though I am an atheist (and a Pastafarian [look it up]).  I believe that religion was instrumental in allowing larger societies to form, to evolve if you will, and helped to make us the dominant species.  Religion has inspired art and literature, and has inspired thinkers as far back as there was religion.  It has even been a friend and patron of the sciences throughout history, and it can still be that friend.  Religion should be taught in history and philosophy classes.  It belongs there, not in a science curriculum.

If you live in Texas, please let the Board of Education know that you do not support the dismantling of science standards in order to shoehorn in the beliefs and superstitions of a nomadic people written 1,000s of year ago.  If you do not live in Texas, and this does enter into the text books, fight against the adoption in your state of any book that gives equal footing to intelligent design.

As for who I am, I am a 46 year old male who has lived his entire life in Southern California.  I ski, mountain and road bike, rock climb and play ping pong and golf (poorly).  I read (not as much as I should) and have pretty much stopped watching TV, mainly because I don't have time for it anymore.  I am married with a daughter in high school, I am a California-registered Professional Engineer, and I work as an environmental consultant, remediating industrial sites.  I am also two year removed from a battle with head and neck cancer due to HPV that I never knew I contracted.  Thankfully, this cancer responds well to treatment, but treatment for head and neck cancer sucks on a level that is hard to describe.  So I urge all of you to vaccinate yourself and your kids against this disease.

October 2013,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/10/08/boy-am-i-lucky/,"October 2013, 08",Boy am I lucky,"Exactly two weeks passed between when I signed up for The Listserv and when I won the lottery.  I know, right?  So a) thanks to my friend Matty for recommending, and b) my apologies to long timers, especially those hoping you'll win because you have a perfect thing to share.  I look forward to reading your perfect thing.  But for now you get to read my imperfect thing, because I'm the lucky one.

I'm not being flippant.  I really am the lucky one, always have been.  Ask my family or close friends.  I have an undeniable thing where I have preposterously good luck.  This isn't new age-y bullshit.  I'm a man of science and empirical data...this is fact.  I take no credit for it and I wish I could harness it (for use in, say, a lottery that awarded cash).  But I can't.  But it's definitely a thing.  So I choose to share the thing that makes me the luckiest.

The thing that makes me the luckiest is my parents.  Clarification: I'm not holding them up as perfect people.  They're sure not.  But, after significant reflection, I feel justified holding them up as perfect parents.  It feels worthy of sharing because good parenting is in woefully short supply these days.  I'm not a parent, but I was parented, and I look back and see that my parents rocked it.  I not only adore them, but I also still seek their advice when faced with important decisions.  That's successful parenting.  I am grateful to this project for giving me a chance to pass along some of their wisdom, which has benefited me so greatly.

""Make good decisions.""  My parents weren't big on forbidding things.  But they made it clear as we got older that being an adult is a series of decisions, and all good things come as a result of making the right choices and learning from the consequences of the bad choices.  So as we left to go out for the night, it wasn't do this or don't do that.  All they said was, ""Make good choices.""  It made me feel responsible and in control, like I had something to live up to, like they believed that I could.

""If you want to make friends, you've gotta be friendly.""  So many situations...new school, new neighborhood, new job, where it's easy to fall into the trap of expecting people to come to you, resenting them for not.  But that's not how life works.  You are the new guy, the burden is on you.  Get out there, be friendly.  People will respond.

""If you see someone else's nose running, go blow your own.""  A classic Irish-Catholic-parentism if ever there was one.  This was from my Mom's mom, her antidote for tattle-tales.  But it applies far beyond childhood.  If you're paying attention, you can learn a lot from your mistakes, and far, far more from the mistakes of people around you.

""Never agree to a deal unless you understand why the other guy likes it.""  This is Dad, the businessman.  It's easy to get wrapped up in what you want out of a deal, but if you don't want to get taken, you have to put yourself in the other guy's shoes.

""90% of life is just showing up.""  The older I get, the truer this feels.  Nothing counts more than being there for the people you care about.  In the best and worst times, you don't have to know what to say, or what to wear, or what to bring.  Just show up and take it from there.

October 2013,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/10/03/crazy-ideas/,"October 2013, 03",Crazy ideas,"I love Legos.  Always have, always will.

Back when I was younger, I could build anything with Legos.  If I could dream it up, the parts I needed were somewhere in that never-ending bin of childhood glee.  Despite being nothing more than a few pennies of plastic, these magic bricks synergistically assembled into futuristic spaceships, mechanized armies, towering skyscrapers and much more.

Sadly, I grew older.  Reality began to encroach on my well-laid plans for conquest of the universe.  My insatiable desire to create never left, and I turned to programming.  In fact, these new constraints added to the challenge, and I enjoyed creating all the more for it.  The best part this time was that it was so wonderfully real - I could run my program, watch all the parts come together and do something.

The funny thing about all of this is that the desire to build, while strong, was not the root of my creative drive.  The ideas are what truly propel me.  I've always had crazy ideas.  Some are outside the boundaries of reality, but most are on the edge of just-might-work-if-the-planets-align possibility.

I've been working on one.  And the planets have aligned - I've won the Listerv Lottery.

You see, while I'm currently a programmer at a San Francisco startup, I'm a transplant.  I hail from the wilds of beautiful upstate New York.

Somehow, Silicon Valley ended up in San Francisco, which is horribly expensive.  I think that this hurts long-term innovation - ideas that require a lot of time to mature are discarded in favor of get-rich-quick startups that don't really benefit humanity.  Worse still, founders of companies bail during inevitable hard times as the point where the money runs out quickly approaches.

Since it's not quite feasible to ask landlords to charge less, I've been looking around for alternate solutions and found one in Rochester, NY.  Ever since the collapse of Kodak, housing prices have been falling.  One can buy a decent 3 bedroom 1 bath house for $26,000.  (That's not the down payment, that's the whole thing!)

So here's the idea: Buy several Rochester houses and bring in entrepreneurs with crazy ideas of their own to work out of them.  Every dollar goes further, so ideas that take time to mature are more viable.  This isn't intended to replace San Francisco, but to help entrepreneurs get up to speed before moving on*.

I have always wanted to build things.  As I've grown, so too have my aspirations.  While I lack the capacity to embark on this adventure (financially), perhaps some of you readers may be able to help?  If you're interested, I’d love to hear from you.

If you interested in starting a company like the ones I’ve been describing (or just getting into programming) shoot me an email.  I (and the rest of Techendo) can help point you in the right direction.

* Technical readers will notice that this is essentially a startup accelerator.  You're right, Paul Graham and YCombinator have been a big influence on me.  This one will focus on low-burn bootstrapping.

It is the only apple pie that I will eat. She is the kind of person who would, for the dough, say ""mix it and then add water or flour until it feels right,"" so it was tricky turning that into a recipe, but these are the instructions that i follow when making it. (i usually make a double batch) Good luck :)

For one ""medium"" sized apple pie.

-1 cup shortening-2 chips flour-5 jhonnagold apples (other cooking apples will work but jhonnagold is my preferred apple) -sugar and cinnamon-a dribble of milk or half and half

Preheat oven to 350.

Crust: -Mix 1 cup shortening, 2 cups flour, 1/2 cup cold water, put in fridge-getting a perfect consistency takes some practice, but it isn't as absolutely vital as some would make it sound. it should have a very slight shine to it, but not be very sticky. Add more flour if it is sticky, more water if it's not shiny.

Apples: -skin and slice/chop up apples-size of chunks of apple is a matter of preference, i make mine fairly small

-sprinkle some sugar on the apples in a mixing bowl (specific amount is not vital, i promise)-sprinkle some cinnamon and then ""accidentally"" open the spoon side instead of the sprinkle side and dump ""way too much"" cinnamon on them (I've never had too much cinnamon, but i keep trying)

Putting it together:- take half of the dough and roll it out and put it in the bottom of a pie pan-dump in apples. There should bee a heaping pile of them.-moisten the outer edge of the crust to get the top crust to stick to it.-roll out the other half and lay over the top, sticking the edges of crust together.-dribble some milk or half and half over the top and sprinkle some sugar on it to help it brown.-cut a fun pattern in the top to let air out (small details well be lost when it cooks)-cook for around an hour. Juice from the apples should be bubbling, crust should be golden.-cool, serve

What an ugly crab!” The crab is upset. He swears he will throw the rice cake in the ocean if another person says that. A third person says “What a cute crab! What an ugly rice cake!” The crab throws the rice cake into the ocean.

Anyway, when I was nine, I entered and won an essay contest that changed my life forever. The prize was a pony - a real, breathing, 7-month-old pony. I could write a novel about training him, learning to ride, and the ups and downs that we faced, but that wouldn’t adequately describe just how much winning this pony changed me (in many ways unrelated to horses). Instead, here are a few brief snapshots of my most memorable times with Sugar (my pony):

- He had a yoga ball that he loved to play with in the arena. He would push it around with his nose and chase after it in endless circles. However, he started trying to jump on the ball so we took it away from him, fearing that it would pop in his face.

- I tried to teach him to bow. After many hours and multiple bags of carrots, we reached a mutual agreement that bowing is just not his thing.

- We were jumping once, and instead of landing on the other side of the fence, we landed on top of it. The pole snapped in half and I fell off, right in front of Sugar's path. Thankfully he managed to scramble to his feet in time to leap over me, though he still clipped me in the head with his hoof. I still have a piece of the jump from that day.

- Sugar can be a brat sometimes. He knows that his name is Sugar, and he knows to come when I whistle. However, occasionally when I try to call him in from the field, he'll just look up at me, think for a few seconds, then turn and trot off in the opposite direction. I can just imagine him laughing at me as he trots away.

- I love to ride him bareback. There's this wonderful sense of freedom in just being able to ride around without a saddle at full speed, a sense of joy that's unlike anything else. I keep Sugar at a barn near the ocean, and on particularly windy days galloping around the arena feels like flying.

Because the first joke wasn’t that great, here’s another one:

A high school couple is saying goodbye on a beach. They’re going to separate colleges, but they promise to meet back in 4 years, at the same beach, at the same time. They exchange promise rings and leave. Four years pass. The girl arrives back on the beach, same place, same time, and waits for her love. He never shows up. She rips off her ring, throws it in the water, and leaves. However, a few miles down the beach is the boy. He had forgotten the correct place. The girl doesn’t show up, but he decides to wait a while. He pulls out his fishing pole and casts the line. He suddenly feels a tug at the end and, thinking it’s a fish, quickly reels it up. He spins and spins, until it finally breaks the water. He pulls it up and sees...

 the rice cake.

September 2013,30,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/09/30/on-rabbit-hair-and-doctor-who/,"September 2013, 30",On Rabbit Hair and Doctor Who,"A while ago a friend asked: ""What's the purpose of your life?"" and I remember replying ""to help others"" (something which I'm shamefully not doing enough of). Still no satisfactory answer to that question from me yet (hey I'm just 19) but I do have a few stray thoughts, so read on if you would indulge in the naivety of a teen. 

1. In ""Sophie's World"" Gaarder compared the world we live in to a rabbit: ""All mortals are born at the very tip of the rabbit's fine hairs, where they are in a position to wonder at the impossibility of the trick. But as they grow older they work themselves ever deeper into the fur. And there they stay. They become so comfortable they never risk crawling back up the fragile hairs again. Only philosophers embark on this perilous expedition to the outermost reaches of language and existence. 'Ladies and gentlemen,' they yell, 'we are floating in space!'. But none of the people down there care. 'What a bunch of troublemakers!' they say, 'Would you pass the butter, please? How much have our stocks risen today?'""

This passage is stuck in my head; the image of a yelling philosopher clinging on to the end of a rabbit hair keeps coming back to mind. Make whatever of it you would, or go pick up a copy of the book even. But as Albert Knox cautioned Sophie, perhaps Gaarder is just reminding us to remain curious like a child; not to become world-weary.

2. Camus talks about the absurd - the contradiction between man's search for meaning in life and his failure to find any - and offers three solutions: to escape through suicide, to commit a leap of faith in the transcendent or to just accept the absurd. I don't quite understand Camus yet, but what if he is right in that the purpose of life remains elusive to everyone? How devoid of hope our lives will be, when ""living is keeping the absurd alive; and keeping it alive is, above all, contemplating it""?

(I could go on a bit more on Chinese philosophy and the role of pursuing morality in life - is it at all important? - but I think I should probably stop all these philosophical nonsense already)

3. Spend time with your family and loved ones. Call them. Nothing's more important. 

4. Help others. 

5. Cook and create new dishes! (If you happen to have a Chinese store nearby that sells Laoganma chilli oil, try that with everything. And I mean EVERYTHING)

6. And watch the latest episode of Doctor Who, of course. Happy 50th anniversary!

I think I might possibly be the first from my country to win the Listserve lottery (A little wave to my fellow countrymen!) So I'm ending off with a quick introduction of Malaysia:- Southernmost country on Eurasia mainland- Beautiful weather- Delicious food- Lovely beaches- Wonderful peopleSo come visit us if you're planning a holiday to Asia!

Live simple, live healthy, live happy :)

September 2013,28,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/09/28/my-would-you-look-at-the-time/,"September 2013, 28","My, Would You Look at the Time","I’m reading a book called “Daily Rituals: How Artists Work” that catalogues the daily habits of famous authors, artists, composers, and so on from the past few centuries. It’s got some helpful tips (e.g. this one courtesy of statesman and turkey enthusiast Ben Franklin: make a list of your goals for the day in the morning; at night, ask yourself what you’ve accomplished) but the most striking commonality among these great minds is that most of them had the luxury to devote their entire lives to what they loved.

I’m 25 now and I’ve spent the better part of three years working the kind of meaningless office job that’s conspicuously absent from most stories in that book. I’m not delusional enough to think I’m on par with Beethoven or Shakespeare or somebody, but I think I can do better than an office job. I’ll admit, I’d love to invent the light bulb, but some guy already did it. And we already have the other stuff that people need, like cotton gins and Angry Birds.

So for now, all I can do is make the best use of my time outside the office. The older I get, the more conscious I become about how to spend my time wisely. I try to ask myself whether any activity I’m doing is meaningful to me and why. I’ve spent so much time in my life on passive activities with no value to me. Watching reruns of the Fresh Prince, reading Buzzfeed lists of the 17 Kittens Most Likely to Run for Congress. It all makes me want to regurgitate that one cliché about how time is our most precious resource, but you guys already know that. And actually… Water is probably more important.

Okay. Sorry, but while we’re on the subject of water, I’m going to make a recommendation and say I’m pretty sure everybody on this list would enjoy reading David Foster Wallace’s “This is Water.” It’s really quick and breezy and you can find it free online.

Did you read “This is Water”? Okay, good. It’s pretty synonymous with my own thoughts on the importance of being conscious of the little decisions we all make in life. Which brings me back to my main point. While I don’t think I have enough skills or direction to quit my aforementioned office job quite yet, I try to spend my free time in ways that matter to me. Mostly I play music, record music, read, and write longwinded ListServe emails.

Using the internet as my guide I’ve gotten alright at recording music—I’ve got Pro Tools and all the usual-suspect cheap mics—SM57s, MXL 990s—but I’d love to learn in a more formalized manner. It seems like kind of a crass request to tack on here, but do you guys know anybody who works in a recording studio in Chicago? I was once an intern for a well-known TV show so I am an expert at running errands, doing chores, and providing unpaid labor in a professional setting.

In any case, I hope everybody takes a moment each evening—like Ben Franklin—to think about what they did that was meaningful that day. Most of us will never have our faces on money or sign a Declaration of Independence but hopefully we can make the best of the time we’ve got.

Both of us wanted to do (and have never done) a marathon, but we weren't interested in running 26.2 miles on pavement, so this was a perfect find.  Before we began training, we both got back from Europe; she had been there for the summer working and I visited her in the last 2 weeks.  In the last week, we visited a friend of mine from Morocco (and his family) during Ramadan, which consisted of a lot of sitting on couches (to avoid the +100F temperatures) and eating a lot of food (Moroccans are very generous to guests).  Feeling uncomfortably full for a week straight and then jumping into long runs again is not fun.

It's been a little over a month since then, and training is going really well (we did 20 miles last week!).  I didn't realize how much of it is really mental training, not even physical.  If you train your body in manageable increments, distances that once seemed unattainable are surprisingly attainable.  The problem is your mind, and keeping it busy as well as staying in good spirits.  Having someone to train with makes all the difference...she's the one that had me up at 6am yesterday to run 14 miles before class.  As much as we're excited for race day, we're also excited to not be training constantly...it's hard work.

Oh yeah, I also have a moped from 1976.  It's slow, loud, and squeaky.  I would recommend it to anyone.  All the freedom of a motorcycle, but the slowness gives you more time to contemplate and enjoy the good weather.  Easy and fun to fix, and pedaling up the steep hills is a good workout.  My friend just joined the Peace Corp in Nepal, and sold me his (a little more modern than mine, 1977), so now I've got two.

Shoot me an e-mail if you like running, mopeds, autumn, or want to know anything about New Hampshire.  I also do quite a bit of photography, so if you're interested I can send a Flickr link.  Also I'm currently reading Gravity's Rainbow...I can't be the only person who is struggling through it.

Stupid alarm… It’s truly a wonder as to how I haven’t thrown my phone out the window… Oh well. Today, I decided to do things differently. Instead of the usual phlegmatic approach to my morning rituals, I whipped out my iPod and practically danced my way to school.

 I stopped at the market to grab myself some lunch and I noticed the girl in front of me was having difficulty with her credit card. Meanwhile, the bitter cashier pushed her aside and asked that I come and make my purchase. I walked up and said I would be paying for the both of us. The girl next to me looked at me with shock (why would anyone do such a thing?! ;) ) and asked if she could take my info to pay me back. I told her this one was on me; just make sure to pay it forward to someone else in need. She still looked pretty dumbfounded when I left her lol.

Later in the afternoon, as I found myself a cozy spot in the library, I learned that I had been selected for the list serve lottery! I always thought of when this day would come. I didn't worry much about what I would say since I new it would find me at the perfect time in my life.

Life, right now, has been quite stressful for me to say the least. I am in my senior year at NYU, studying for the LSAT's, working in the National Security Department at the Brennan Center for Justice (NYU Law), writing a thesis paper, creating/managing a magazine for NYU (nyuglobalexpress(dot)org) etc.

Last week, I was breaking under the workload and stress, especially after coming back from living in Spain for a year and having to re-assimilate my life back into the fast-paced NYC lifestyle. I had reached a low point in my life, feeling completely overwhelmed and not knowing how to move forward. Then it hit me, I was so focused on all the things I needed/had to do that I had begun to feel the suffocating grasp of limitation. How could I possibly do it all and succeed? That was my problem.

The realization struck me: our limits, if any, are self-imposed. How we think ultimately determines how we do. Our capabilities truly have the ability to manifest themselves if we can rid the boundaries we have mentally, and even socially, created. All that they require is the belief in their possibilities.

I must say, I have heard from many that they need to see in order to believe (with regard to faith, magic, science, etc.). In response to this, let me ask you one thing: how does one see if they are not willing to believe? Let that sink in for a moment.

My name is Natasha Babazadeh and I am 21 years old. I WILL excel in all of my classes like I have done the past three years. I WILL leave a significant work contribution to the Brennan Center. I WILL make the LSAT my bitch. I WILL create a badass magazine to circulate around NYU and all its study abroad sites. I WILL write a thesis paper that’ll blow your mind. I WILL help complete strangers. I WILL make an impact. I WILL change the world.

I did the Wall Street thing for 6 years before walking out one day and taking a trip around the world. I spent months dreaming about doing it. I kept asking myself, “What would it be like? If not now, when?” After suffering incredible anxiety over the prospect, I mustered up the courage, broke the news to my boss, and walked out of the office without saying a word to anyone.

One week later I was on a plane to Corsica.

I donated almost all of my possessions except my books. Books are the hardest thing for me to get rid of. My library is a direct reflection of my obsessions at any point in time. One month I was on this film noir binge and suddenly I had a Mickey Spillane section. When I discovered Mad Men, suddenly I had an advertising section. I still have this thing that whenever I see a used bookstore or a street seller I ask if they have any used Kurt Vonnegut books and buy out any Dell paperback editions from the 1980’s. I have about a hundred. I try to give them away to friends (I have a lot of friends), but I continually find myself going to as many used bookstores. “God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater” is a favorite of mine to pass along. Not only is it amazing (and way better than Slaughter-house Five), but most people have never even heard of it.

It’s been exactly one year this month since I took off. I’m thirty pounds lighter and much less anxious. I live completely detached from the market and the media circus. I’ve spent the last several months trying to find the right opportunity. I’ve got a professional job-coach that has literally re-trained me for navigating the corporate medium. I feel like a foreigner who doesn’t understand the culture or the language anymore. Just the other day I was having coffee with another Wall-Streeter. I was having trouble keeping up with the corporate-speak and it hit me how far I really was from that world.

I have a recurring dream that I’m back at my Wall Street broker-dealer and all my ex-coworkers are staring at me. The office is unfamiliar; I’ve learned the boss has taken me back as a favor to me. My suit doesn’t fit me anymore and I look extremely awkward. I sit down at my desk and stare at my hands, doing nothing.

Now, don’t get me wrong, I don’t want this to come off as a bunch of generation-y horseshit. I’m just out here trying to reinvent myself. The social pressure to settle is on its own an excruciatingly strong force.  There’s a well defined, rigid societal structure in place that keeps the system going (just look at the NYTimes wedding section). I say live your life on your own terms, otherwise what’s the point? In the words of Bill Watterson, “You’ll be told in a hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep climbing, and never be satisfied with where you are, who you are, and what you’re doing. There are a million ways to sell yourself out, and I guarantee you’ll hear about them. To invent your own life’s meaning is not easy, but it’s still allowed, and I think you’ll be happier for the trouble.”

After helping build a successful equity derivatives strategy and trading firm in NYC, I am actively looking for startup opportunities in anywhere, USA. Feel free to send cool companies my way. Feedback welcomed.

I have a nephew.

Two weeks ago, while my brother and I drove him to the zoo singing country music at the top of our lungs, my nephew stopped us mid-lyric. ""What's free? You said free?"" Strapped into a car seat, wearing swim goggles, covered in chocolate, peanut shells, cheddar bunnies, and matchbox cars, my nephew had asked a question so fundamental to all of our daily lives that we often forget it's a question at all.

I pulled the ""I'm-just-the-aunt"" card, and turned to my brother to articulate one of the ideals our nation was founded upon, one of the dreams we are all supposed to hold together. Somehow, with no time to prepare, he boiled down freedom to the perfect level for his son’s current cerebral development. “It’s being able to make choices in your life,” he explained. My nephew processed, nodded, and resumed racing his sticky cars around his sticky seat.

My brother didn’t say that freedom meant being able to do absolutely anything you want. He didn’t say that freedom meant having no commitment or responsibility. He defined it as the ability to make choices, and I like that my nephew’s first encounter with this enormous word gave it the weight it deserves.

I began to feel my own freedom recently, after working closely with a few of the more than two million incarcerated adults in our country. I coordinate a pro bono practice out of a law firm, in which we provide free legal representation to defendants facing violent felony charges. I spend my time in jail, prison, and courtrooms, listening to and advocating for people who may never know freedom again.

Today was the sentencing of the defendant we represented in my first full jury trial. Any sentence he faced carried a term to life, which means the number would simply be the year eligible to be denied parole. No parole board will ever approve release, and, in his mid-fifties, he is facing death behind bars. The sentence wasn’t about his prison term, but about where and how he will die. Much of what I do in defense begins to feel like end-of-life counseling, helping people understand that they will have almost no choices for the foreseeable future, if not the rest of their lives.

Walking out and continuing to live my life, free, brings new awareness. I think about the many surfaces I cross, the sounds I hear, the way light reflects on the world around me. Every time I leave Rikers Island, I feel the painful irony that the bridge back to Queens provides the most spectacular view of the New York City skyline, a view and a place that the 12,000 inmates will not see or enjoy for years.

In my brief experiences in criminal justice, I see a system that temporarily retains while fostering more hatred, violence, and division. I see judges and prosecutors with their hands tied by obscenely high sentences: three years for a stolen cell phone, eight years for a burgled DVD player. I see my tax dollars adding to the sum total of suffering in this country, instead of developing opportunity.

Many days I forget the choices I have, the choices I make. I don’t want to forget my freedom. With it, I am going to try to change what prison means in America, because we as a country are better, smarter, and kinder than the injustice we submit our citizens to every day.

Make good choices.

I come from the bleak era of Standardized Testing, but I always enjoyed (or at least tolerated) the writing portions. This was probably because I had one story I liked to tell, and I fit it to the prompt year after year. It’s a story of reckless bravery and adventure. It’s a story of family. It’s a story about the power of nature. Or maybe it’s just about the power of cookies.

Most of my dad’s family lives scattered throughout California. Around my dad’s birthday in June, we all went on a camping trip to the Pinnacles. My parents (wisely) brought an RV, the rest of the adults slept in a giant tent, and the four cousins slept in the back of a truck. We heard rustling all night, but thought nothing of it.

In the morning we went on a grueling hike. We brought enough snacks, but not nearly enough water. California gets pretty hot and dry in June, but apparently all of us native Californians had forgotten this particular climate fact. My dad saved the day by taking the empty water bottles, hiking down to the bottom to fill them up, and rescuing my dehydrated family members.

As if that weren't enough excitement for one day, when we got back to the campsite and had made dinner, we started hearing more rustling over by the food storage. Thinking it was probably a raccoon or something, my aunts, parents, and grandparents go over to investigate. Naturally, the kids follow. It’s not a raccoon. It has tusks and is GIANT. It’s a wild boar. And there’s another one. And it’s eating our garlic bread!

My biologist grandpa starts clapping and making a bunch of noise, but the boar doesn’t seem to notice and keeps chomping away. Foldable metal chairs are brandished, flashlights are turned on, someone even thinks to snap a photo of the lunacy. But it’s not until the boars go for the cookies that my aunt goes for the boars. Wielding a folding chair, she snatches the cookies, and the boars, apparently satisfied, saunter off.

I hear that the wild boars have been exterminated from the camping area. I guess that’s good for future campers, but it’s sad for future timed-essay writers.

The best cookies I've ever eaten:

Dry stuff1 2/3 cup flour3/4 tsp baking powder1/2 tsp baking soda1/2 tsp salt3/4 cup brown sugar1/3 cup sugar

Liquids3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) butter1 tsp vanilla1 egg

The tasty bits1 3/4 cup chocolate chips (11.5 oz bag)1 cup coconut1 cup oatmeal1 cup chopped walnuts

Oven: 375 degrees FahrenheitBake Time: 8-11 minutes

People say you're supposed to mix the liquids with the sugars separately and then mix that with the flour and stuff. And that you're not supposed to melt the butter. Who has the time? Sometimes you just want a cookie, you know? I melt the butter and mix all the stuff in one bowl at pretty much the same time. I do put the chocolate, coconut, oatmeal, and walnuts in last. I've experimented with different sized cookies, but they are tasty when tiny or enormous, so just try not to burn them and you'll be alright. Usually makes about 3-4 dozen, but if you make them small you can get a lot more.

Oh, and DFTBA!

This past weekend (9/13), I attended a show by the controversial band Death In June. Douglas Pearce (the sole continuous member) has been accused of being a racist, a Nazi, a fascist, and worse. The fact that he is openly gay, Jewish, and has played sold out shows in Israel is beside the point. I have listened to his music for years. I consider myself on the left end of the political spectrum.  I’ve read any number of interviews and clarifications that Pearce has made about his views. I have a graduate degree in philosophy. I have participated in a number of civil rights demonstrations across the country. I can safely say that I find nothing fascist or hateful about him or his music. This is my conclusion. I stand by it.

Others only look at surface images of the band, and project their worst fears onto it. Those are their conclusions.  I have listened to their arguments, and read their cases. I remain unconvinced.

The show I attended was protested by a group identifying themselves as anti-fascists. They have a right to do this.  I respect this.

Rather than engaging us in dialogue, however, they became violent - openly harassing (an ethnically diverse!) group of people waiting politely in line for the show.  There were fists involved. They tried to storm the venue. It was their assumption that we were all waiting to attend the next Nuremberg rally, and that we were Nazis who needed to be stopped.

The anti-fascists wound up physically harming a number of minority members of the audience.  Additionally, they had vandalized the club where DIJ played the night before, and succeeded in threatening another venue to the point of cancelling a sold out show (which has since been relocated).

In 1920s-1930s Germany, the Nazi Party deployed a group known as the Sturmabteilung, or “brown shirts” to disrupt, threaten, intimidate, and physically harm political opponents.  How, qualitatively, were the actions of the anti-fascists different from the tactics of the Sturmabteilung? Tactics aside, how is it anti-fascist to declare yourselves the gatekeepers of what people can, cannot, should, and should not listen to?

In their quest for a villain, they became the villains. Rather than seeking common ground (of which, I suspect, there may have actually been much between them and the audience), they demonized us.

Additionally, they denied our humanity in an even more fundamentally important way –they denied us the choice, the chance to make up our own minds about what we were seeing and hearing. They failed to recognize our own abilities – our own rights – to recognize good and evil.

Walt Kelly, the creator of the comic-strip POGO, wrote in 1953, regarding the McCarthy hearings:

“Traces of nobility, gentleness and courage persist in all people, do what we will to stamp out the trend. So, too, do those characteristics which are ugly…There is no need to sally forth, for it remains true that those things which make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand. Resolve then, that on this very ground, with small flags waving and tinny blasts on tiny trumpets, we shall meet the enemy, and not only may he be ours, he may be us.”

In Jungian psychology, there is a term for this – “owning one’s shadow.” I hope that someday, the 8 protesters (not 20, as they claim) look into this, and find resolution.

Then, perhaps, we can all move forward and fight real evil - together.

Oh yeah.  The show?  Simply amazing.

September 2013,20,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/09/20/how-to-write-a-great-email/,"September 2013, 20",How to write a great email,"Hello Listserve-ians,

I used to write email for a living for progressive political causes, so I thought I'd take this opportunity to share what I've learned about writing emails to large numbers of people. Perhaps these tips will serve you well when you win the Listserve lottery or whenever you find yourself needing to send a clear, compelling email to many people at once.

First, have a clear ask. Don't bury the story -- effective emails ask the reader to do something up front. If you want your readers to do something -- and you probably do, otherwise why are you sending mass email? -- let them know clearly what they should do as quickly as possible. If you've typed more than a sentence or two and haven't gotten to your ask, revise your draft and see if you can get it in earlier. And try to have only one ask per email. If you want your readers to do more than one unrelated thing, send them more than one email.

Second, use direct, conversational language, and keep it short. Your email isn't a term paper or a novel or a text message. A casual tone, clear wording, and an eye for brevity will quickly communicate to your readers what you want them to do. Save the long explanations, detailed asides, and endless adjectives for another time.

Third, tell a story and be authentic. There is a saying that you should write drunk and edit sober. The best emails tell a compelling story in an authentic way, so people are moved to take whatever action you're asking of them. Your story should be real and heartfelt, should clearly explain why the reader should take action and what effect their action will have, and shouldn't ring false. For more advice telling great stories, google ""New Organizing Institute story of self"" and click the first link.

Bonus: Become a consumer of email. I've signed myself up for every political email list I can find -- Republicans, Democrats, advocates, politicians, nonprofits, everyone. I read these emails to look for new trends, get ideas, and scope out new techniques. If you write a lot of email, it's worth your time getting to know what your peers are doing.

Email is a wonderful tool -- it moves mass numbers of people to action every day. I hope with these tips, you can move people to take the action you'd like them to take, too!

If you need a free tool to send mass email and do other online organizing, I've just released one called the Action Network. Google ""now you can mass email people like Obama"" and click on the Washington Post article to learn more about it. And if you have questions about email writing or online organizing, feel free to reply and ask away!

I would like to invite you to embark on a part experiment part attempt at collaborative art with me that promises to be very interesting: at least for me. Perhaps a little about me before I describe the experiment. I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo (if you’re at UB too, holler!). I'm especially interested in languages: their versatility in conveying our intangible and complex emotions, the obscure mists of evolution that mask how they diverged from their common origins and how the nifty anchors of words latch onto our subconscious to offer themselves in times of communicative need.

And then there are poets and writers, who create entire worlds from a handful of words: burdening their tiny bodies with convoluted metaphors, animating their abstract skeletons with powerful emotions. Once the connection between the two has been forged, the mere mention of the word brings the emotions simmering back to the surface. That’s where the experiment comes in. I’d like you to write back to me, with the first memory that comes to your mind when I mention the following words:

Coffee

Rain

Clouds

Moonlight

Grass

I have written a small program that can pull images from the web for a given phrase.  The second part of this experiment is where I aggregate results from everyone who wrote in. The idea is to combine the collective memories into a collage. Pictures, the third in the trinity of expression.  Once the collages are completed, I would write back to those who contributed and maybe even put them on the web.

So I invite you to join in. Let technology aid us in collective human expression.

September 2013,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/09/18/roll-tears-roll/,"September 2013, 18",ROLL TEARS ROLL,"Ideally, I would want this email to relate to every person here, in one way or another. My attempt is broken down into three parts. Let me know how I do.

Part One:

The best thing to learn to cook is gumbo. It is always delicious. Even if its not, throw some hot sauce and butter-loaded rice in there, and it’s delicious.

My favorite recipe comes from googling “New Year Sausage and Andoille Gumbo”. Of course, I use whatever meat I have handy, store-bought seasoning, and low-sodium chicken broth. The rice has to be cooked with butter and a bay leaf. And that’s the beauty of gumbo – it’s waiting to be perfected according to you. Go now and cook it. Holler if you need help.

Part Two:

""Now, no matter what the mullah teaches, there is only one sin, only one. And that is theft. Every other sin is a variation of theft. Do you understand that? When you kill a man, you steal a life. You steal his wife's right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone's right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. Do you see? There is no act more wretched than stealing, Amir. A man who takes what's not his to take, be it a life or a loaf of naan...I spit on such a man.”

As an atheist, the most common question that pops up after the awkward pause is some variation of, ""so...how you know good from bad?""

To be honest, it's a frustrating question because I have always felt that my desire to be a decent human being was innate. I never spent time learning to justify it, but now I do. I reach out for different books, philosophies, poems, quotes, commencement speeches, fortune cookies, Snapple caps - anything that will put into words what I've felt all my life. The excerpt above is one passage I have found that did just that for me. It's basic, concise, and most importantly, true. I have stolen this for my own, and it is now a part of what I believe. The ideas I have about how to live are not radical or new. They have been spoken before, by someone, somewhere, in some manner unbeknownst to me. I just have to find them.

Part Three:

Try AmerCorps. A federally funded, full-time volunteer program that places participants into various non-profits throughout the country. As I like to describe it, it's like the Peace Corps. But in America. And for only 10 months.

Have a gap year to fill? Want to know what it truly means to give back? Want to try out living in a new city (for almost no cost)? Hate your job and looking for something different? Email me. Tell me what you're looking for. I'm in the love with the idea of what I'm doing right now, and I will spend however long it takes spreading the message that there is a program out with the sole purpose of providing perspective and fulfillment. Yes, that sounds cheesy. Yes, it means temporarily leaving the comfort of whatever life you have created for yourself. Yes, it's a difficult process. But I promise you, it will give you the breath of fresh air that you didn't even know you needed. Give me the chance to prove it to you.

She is my favorite person in the world.

For those of you who don’t know, Abuela is Spanish for grandmother and mine is top notch.  When I was five and my favorite movie was Mary Poppins, Abuela promised me to take me to feed the birds at St. Paul’s Cathedral.  She did so much more – she took me to Spain, England and France on an almost month long and amazing trip. You couldn't feed the birds anymore at St. Paul's Cathedral, but that didn't slow us down.

When I was thirteen, she retired and moved to Austin, where I grew up. I think she knew how much my little brother and I would need her – my parents separated 8 months later and her house, just 2 miles from mine, became a much needed oasis. At 18, I decided to defer college and join AmeriCorps, a decision that wasn’t well received by my parents, but she supported me.  When I was 23 and wanted to move across the country to be with the man I adore, she said “go and be happy.”

She taught me that even though people might not treat you well, you should still treat them with kindness and dignity.

She taught me patience through knitting and that you can always fix a mistake without taking out the last 10 rows.

She taught me how to shuffle a deck of cards and that you don't come to the card table without money.

She taught me that Thanksgiving was the best holiday because, it’s not about things, it’s about people and being gracious for what you have. I will always cherish our pre-Thanksgiving Chinese food dinners and how she would turn the AC on in November so my homemade hot chocolate would warm me while we watched the Thanksgiving Day parade.

She taught me that good friends were more important than many friends. She always insisted that it was going to be those good friends that get you through the toughest times. She's right. I went home a few weeks ago, after Abuela was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer.  She's fighting against some ridiculous odds, but at 84, she's winning.  It's wonderful.  She has the most amazing group of friends helping her and I have a great group supporting me.

I want to move home to spend time with her, take her to doctor’s appointment, and to be sure someone is there when she needs a hand. I'm excited about this opportunity -- I get to care for my favorite person, but I'm also scared.  I would be leaving my boyfriend of seven years and well-paying job for something unknown.  Any advice?

Thanks for listening,

September 2013,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/09/16/building-community/,"September 2013, 16",Building Community,"Because I love building community and connecting, here are a few things I would love you all to know about:

Trash for Peace: Reduce, Reuse, and Rethink the way you look at trash.

I volunteer with an awesome nonprofit that creates functional art from trash.  We look for ways to reduce consumption.  We reuse plastic bottles and other “trash” to create recycle bins, green houses, and more.  We encourage people to rethink the concept of trash/waste through creativity and innovation.  Google us, “like” us on facebook, or shoot us an email – we love partnering with other organizations!  We also post our manuals on our website for free, so please download them and use them in your classroom, organization, or business!

Oregon’s Health CO-OP (or any of the other Health CO-OPs nationwide)

I have a background in public health, and I’ve always felt like health insurance was a bit of a dirty word.  Well finally there is an alternative (sadly, only in some states) starting January 1st!  Oregon’s Health CO-OP is a nonprofit that listens to what Oregonians want in a health insurance plan, and we have made a plan to reflect that! Brilliant, right?  It focuses on innovation, building community and trust, thus helping everyone to move forward and become healthier together.

Important changes to your health insurance plan through the Affordable Care Act!

For women from the United States, starting January 1st, your health insurance plan is required to cover: well-woman visits; counseling and testing for sexually transmitted diseases; ALL FDA approved contraceptive or sterilization methods/procedures; breastfeeding support, supplies, and counseling (this includes breast pumps); and screening and counseling for interpersonal and domestic violence.  This is mandatory on ALL health insurance plans FREE OF CHARGE. No co-pay.  No co-insurance.  FREE – if you have health insurance, so make sure you have some type of plan!  If you live in Oregon, check out CoverOregon and see if you’re eligible for governmental assistance on your monthly premiums (I’m sure other states have similar health insurance marketplaces) – or for free insurance through Medicaid.

Dr. Vandana Shiva

Google her if you don’t know who she is.  Her background is fascinating and her work, inspirational! She runs a seed saving nonprofit for organic women farmers in India called Navdanya.  She also helped Bhutan create the Gross National Happiness Assessment.  Who cares about GDP if no one is happy?

Tanzania Travel Plans?

Any interest in visiting Kilimanjaro, Serengeti, Ngorogoro Crater, Zanzibar, + more?  Let me know!  I know the most amazing tour guide in the country.  He can make your trip as low or as high budget as you want, and I promise he’ll point out camouflaged animals you otherwise wouldn't spot or help you get to the top of the mountain.  I would put my life in his hands, no question.  I used to live in Tanzania and have traveled around with many guides.  He has true magic.

And just because I am a rule follower, here’s something important I’ve learned that I would like to share with all the other rule followers out there…

Just because you follow the rules, doesn’t mean you can’t color outside the lines.  There is no RULE that says you have to stay within the lines.  Often times, doing something differently leads to a new perspective. Sometimes, it leads to the creation of a masterpiece.

Hope to connect with you soon!

All my best,

September 2013,15,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/09/15/what-would-you-do-with-five-dollars/,"September 2013, 15",What would you do with five dollars?,"I have never been very good at telling stories: I fumble, I slur words, I backtrack. But here I am, winning the chance to write an email to the world, so here is my story:I am living on five dollars a day for reweave (google it!).

It all started as a way to fundraise. Donate $1,000 and I’ll live on five dollars a day for a month.

What does it mean, exactly? There is no right or wrong way to do this experiment, but I set up rules so I could stay on track. This challenge goes beyond food; transportation, entertainment, and even a new toothbrush are being taken into account.

The rules are as follows:

I will not go into ""debt"" with friends (ie. having them pay for something and then I pay them back on October 1st).If I accept something for free it either needs to be donated by an organization, offered for free to everyone, or it needs to be something I would have received for free even prior to this experiment.Rent is not being included in this experiment because that would negatively affect my roommates, and that would be kind of scummy of me.

I know my monthly t-pass was $43 and I use the MBTA at least twice a day, five times a week. There are 20 workdays in September (excludes Labor day), so I pay approximately one dollar per bus/t ride. That leaves me with about $3 for food for the rest of the day. (If I walk home from work then I have $4.00!)

Food is a bit trickier. Eating at a restaurant has been of the question.I've been saving my receipts and found that if I ""charge"" myself per serving, I can keep track of how much I spend and how much I eat.

For example: If I buy a container of oatmeal for $4.99 and there are 15 cups, I know that each 1/2 cup serving costs me 19 cents - that’s how much I will ""charge"" myself for breakfast.

My usually breakfast is oatmeal. Lunch = good ol’ PB&J. Dinner = Eggs and frozen veggies, sometimes pasta if I’m feeling adventurous (and by that I mean its harder to measure). I’ll throw a banana or a glass of milk in the mix for added nutrients.

At first glance it seems I am eating a well-rounded diet, however my body is already feeling the effects of transitioning from an organic diet to “the cheap stuff”. Also, the average person eats two or three times the recommended serving size, meaning that I am getting sufficiently less vegetable and fruit servings by measuring it out than by eating until I am full.

I have been seeing the effects in my sleep, my skin, my hair, and especially my weight. I have been keeping track of my caloric intake to ensure than I am eating a healthy amount, but eating more than 1,600 calories is a struggle.

People are not meant to live and eat on $5 a day. I repeat: human beings are NOT meant to live and eat on $5 a day. Think of the people who are forced to live on less.

Am I happy I am doing this experiment? Yes, and honestly, I would recommend that everyone do it for even just a week. It makes me think about the value of a dollar, the value of a serving, and the value of a meal.

What would you do with five dollars?

September 2013,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/09/13/older-and-wiser/,"September 2013, 13",Older and Wiser?,"Hello Listserve:

            I am considerably older than most of those who have already posted their messages on this site, and thus I have lost most of my armor of idealism .  Much of this is due to the experiences I have had working as a Psychologist in Massachusetts mill cities for almost forty years.  I feel I have seen almost everything humanity can offer.  I no longer question whether something is good or bad; I just see it as fascinating.

            There is nothing anyone can do that would surprise me any more.  Anything my wildest imagination can produce someone out there is doing it, and they are doing it thinking it will bring them happiness or satisfaction.  Most of the time it doesn’t.

            I would give you all advice, because I know, better than Dr. Phil, what you should do with your life, but more than that I know that you wouldn’t listen. That's not how people change.  Change has to come through emotional experience.  Perhaps in three years you might think back and say, “maybe that guy was on to something.”

            I am a big believer in the saying “When the student is ready, the teacher appears.”

            Humans are a work in progress, an intriguing but flawed species.  If you haven’t realized by now, please take notice: the world is almost always run by character-disordered people.  Kings, Queens, generals, presidents, tyrants, business leaders, billionaires, market movers, and celebrates are usually greedy, power-hungry narcissists, or else they have that missionary zeal and are self-righteous.  That’s not always true, only about 90% of the time.

            Most people are basically kind and caring. They want to get along, have a few satisfying relationships – which is difficult enough-- contribute something to the good of the world and then relax and enjoy their family and friends.  But then someone comes along who wants to grab power and take control  of everyone and everything.  He (it almost always is a he) identifies some small difference as a huge threat, then gathers a group of devoted followers to save his people from it, and everything goes downhill from there.   Just look at history, and look at what’s going on now.

            As I said, I am old, I am wise, and I know everything about human relationships.  If you want an answer just send me the question.  I won’t expect you to take my advice.

The combination of anonymity, a fleeting power to amplify my voice, and a word limit to simplify it makes me feel both safe and significant for today. I can open up to strangers. I can say something important. I can say the most important thing—if I could only realize and articulate it within 48-hours. But it’s the first weeks of my PhD. So I cant. And in the absence of Best, [though I don’t believe there is one], I leave you something good:

“In the center of [the city called] Fedora, that gray stone metropolis, stands a metal building with a crystal globe in every room. Looking into each globe, you see a blue city, the model of a different Fedora. These are the forms the city could have taken if, for one reason or another, it had not become what we see today. In every age someone, looking at Fedora as it was, imagined a way of making the ideal city, but while he constructed his miniature model, Fedora was already no longer the same as before, and what had been until yesterday a possible future became only a toy in a glass globe.

The building with the globes is now Fedora's museum: every inhabitant visits it, chooses the city that corresponds to his desires, contemplates it, imagining his reflection in the medusa pond that would have collected the waters of the canal (if it had not been dried up), the view from the high canopied box along the avenue reserved for elephants (now banished from the city), the fun of sliding down the spiral twisting minaret (which never found a pedestal from which to rise).

On the map… there must be room both for the big, stone Fedora and the little Fedoras in glass globes. Not because they are all equally real, but because all are only assumptions. The one contains what is accepted as necessary when it is not yet so; the others, what is imagined as possible and, a moment later, is possible no longer.” – Invisible Cities, Italo Calvino

If we are not careful, we can spend so much time building the world of our dreamsthat we miss the world around us.And if we are not careful, we can watch the world around us so intentlythat we never enjoy the dream to make it better.

""There must be room both for....Fedora and the...Fedoras in glass globes.""

Now, I treasure passion and purpose. If asked what I see as something beautiful, I would say the sight a person in the act of their passion—be it painting, wandering, debating, laughing... If asked what I feel feeds my depths, I would say the moments that I engage my own passions—but I would also say the knowledge that I am making the world better, even if only for one person. In some ways, these two concepts are Fedora and the Fedoras of the glass globes.

Here goes:

Why can children laugh 300 to 400 times in a day while adults laugh only 4- 15 times? What have we lost or misplaced?

I am at that point in my life where approaching the big six 0 has had me reorganizing priorities, possessions, people, time.  It has meant the downsizing, discarding, minimizing of work and stuff. It has meant simplifying activities and relationships. It has given me more time to read, travel, and discover new things. To reconnect with friends and family. This increased quality of life, way outweighs the decrease in income.

My latest discovery is Laughter Yoga.  Anyone try it or belong to a club? I was watching Wavy Gravy on PBS was fascinated by his life and personality and intrigued by Laughing Yoga. So I checked it out.

It is exhausting. It is embarrassing. It is forced. I started with 2 minutes and slowly worked myself up to 10 minutes. I have the TV on. I do it to videos on my computer, slowly learning the different techniques. At first I just felt stupid, but now I feel great!

My wife and I have been trying to conceive for over five years, suffering one miscarriage and month after month of letdowns and discouragements.  Turns out we both bring our own specific biological issues that, when combined, compound the problem.

While I’m well aware that we are not the first couple to grapple with infertility and conception issues, this is one of those things where knowing you’re not alone isn’t always the most comforting thought.  Add to that the staggering amount of tips, suggestions, medical information, etc., it can get downright frustrating.

When things don’t work as they should, be it electronics, automobiles, or my reproductive system, it drives me crazy!  There’s no real peace in the knowledge that there’s nothing I can really do to cause my body to produce the correct amount of sperm.

There are options, of course, with adoption or in vitro fertilization leading the pack.  We’re not opposed to either, although they’re not exactly in our budgetary cards just yet.  If anyone can point Oprah our way, there’s a high five with your name on it.  Honestly, the romantic idea of conceiving a child the “old fashioned way,” is just what our hearts are set on.

Through it all, hope has been both our strongest ally and greatest source of pain.  Each month, we carry the hope that this time, this month will be the one.  And each month, we feel like idealistic, optimistic fools, only to start the whole process over again.  Regardless, I worry about us losing that hope.

I’ve been working on and off on a blog about our experiences where, if nothing else, I’ve found supportive and comforting folks who read and share.  We can share links, of course, so I’m not sure if this makes it through, but you can find it by heading to howtomakebabiesdotwordpressdotcom.

 My wife and I are praying people, constantly covering this and seeking an answer.  There’s a certain level of acceptance by now, but there’s always hope.

I think that’s what I’d like to leave off with…there’s always hope.  So many things can be denied or taken away in this world, but hope, though it may sting us at times, is what keeps us going.

I recently moved to Helsingborg, Sweden. Some may say that was a terrible mistake but I like the cold. My career has revolved around IT Support but I’ve also worked abroad as a Camp Counselor (MN, USA) & Volunteer English teacher (Xi’an, China).

Here are a short series of notes that I would like to share with you all.

The types of people I enjoy:

The go-getters, the wild ones, the spontaneous, the courageous and the brave, the thinkers and the doers, the optimists and the non-conformists and above all else - the ones that know themselves.

OTP22: Cryptography, Svalbard & Dead Drops:

Almost a year to this day I started working with a small team to try and solve the mystery behind OTP22. OTP22 is an ARG (Alternate Reality Game) that has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep its MO a secret. We still do not fully know what it is all about. The latest dead drop is in Bulgaria at location 42.0552, 25.5927, if you are near please email me. More info can be found on our Wiki or through our IRC Chan: freenode.net #ARG

Board games:

I feel like board games have fallen out of the mainstream now that we have computers. I recently got back into them and you know what? They are great fun! It really brings a great social aspect to any evening. My favorites at the moment are: Elder Signs, Settlers of Catan and Pandemic. I also want to try Formula D, Game of Thrones & Twilight Struggle. For anyone interested, you should really check out Wil Wheaton’s series on Youtube called Tabletop.

Apps I use (MAC):

- QuickCal: Hotkey: Ctrl + Shift + R. This allows me to quickly add things to my calendar or reminders list.

- Alarms: Hotkey: Cmd + E. Reminders that I make with QuickCal are displayed in a panel dropdown with this app.

- Screenfloat: Hotkey: Opt + Shift + W. Extremely useful for keeping stuff onscreen.

- Snagit: Hotkey: Cmd + Shift + W. Screenshot app that copies to clipboard (Pro tip for Retina Displays: This app fixes the huge screenshot issue)

- Cloud: Hotkey to auto-upload screenshot and copy the link to your clipboard: Ctrl + Opt + C. Perfect for fast sharing.

- Airmail: Similar to Sparrow but still in development.

- Clocks: Hotkey: Cmd + D. I’ve disabled my normal clock; this allows me to see the time anywhere in the World (useful in OTP22).

- Notefile by JuneCloud: Had some issues with Apple Notes deleting my stuff so I switched to this and haven’t looked back!

- Zoomit: Hotkey: Opt + Z. Finally, a Loupe for your Mac.

The Future:

At our current rate of consumption and with the world’s population growing exponentially I fear the tipping point is near. The greed of men has got in the way of sustainability. This planet is all we have, letting corporations ruin it solely for profits is like letting a bully get your lunch money, and your parents worked hard for that money damn it! Don’t feel as though you are powerless to do something. I have a soft spot for the underdog and I know others do too. Winning a battle that may seem to you like David vs. Goliath will soon turn into 100,000 David’s, and one of those David’s is bound to have a stone that hits hard.

Pay it forward and always remember how far you’ve come.

I'm writing this from Reykjavik, Iceland. I arrived here from NYC yesterday, and leave for Paris tomorrow. I'm from San Francisco, originally. I am 25. (not relevant at all to the content of my message, but a little background info is always fun..)

A few things:

1) The world is small. We have so many experiences/emotions in common. Think about that the next time you feel alone - you're not. 

2) Be good to your family. Your time with them is not guaranteed. But when it ends - remember, its not the number of years, it's the quality of those years. (rest in peace dad, 4/17/13, I still miss you - and my heart and thoughts goes out to those who are or have been affected by any type of cancer. You are cared for!)

3) Go easy on yourself. It's your first time through this life.;)

4) Whatever it is - you'll be ok. I promise. :)

With lots of jetlag and love,

Here is a short version of the story. This summer my husband and I quit our jobs and moved from the Midwest to the Northwest. I'd been missing mountains something terrible during my 16 year tenure in the flatlands, and this year the time was right for us to make the move. In some ways the plan was taking shape over the last several years, but really came into focus the last 12-18 months.

We did not have jobs waiting for us, at least not in the traditional sense. But we no longer want to have jobs be the primary driver in deciding where we live and when we could travel. Our goal is to cultivate location independent sources of income (we do still need income.. there is no trust fund we can fall back on). Before we quit our jobs we cultivated freelance consulting work that would give us a foundation to build on and we worked to have at least a years worth of comfortable living expenses in our savings account. 

Our longer term goal is to have a home base but to be able to spend 3, 6, 12 months in other locations learning and working with different people in different environments. 

My work focuses on community engagement and helping groups develop collective decision making practices. My husband is a technology writer, though his first love is radio. You can find one of his projects by searching for Radio Survivor. 

I'm interested in hearing from people who have experiences with working freelance or as a contingent worker (by choice); and from people who have made decisions that some considered risky but just felt right to you.

Also, tell me about where you live (or where you have lived) and what is great about it, or why it should be avoided... I'm always looking for the next place for a new adventure. 

Thanks to the folks at The Listserve for running this great experiment, and thanks to Jenny B for turning me on to it! 

all the best,

I learned a lot about who I am and who I want to be and how to accomplish it. As an example, I had to learn to live alone the first time while in a foreign country, and I learned that I really really hate washing the toilet but I love doing my own dishes.

As a gamer (zerg rush anyone?) as well as someone with an engineering mindset, I knew what I had to do to get what I want. To minimize all the things that I hate to do or don't need in order to maximize my resources to do what I want. We as humans have long passed the capacity to be able to sustain our most important needs for survival but society is very good, too good in fact, in making us think we need more, and more.

It works for me because I want to be an entrepreneur. Many of you who are reading are probably in the same boat. Every penny that I make goes to my savings or the nearest liquid investment. Having a house just means that you have a bigger risk to take when you are planning to go out on your own and start a venture.

It works for me because I am environmentally conscious. Every flyer that you did not take from someone on the streets saves a tree over your lifetime (totally just made that up). I have stopped bringing every printout material that I received from conventions, conferences and I always try and put those materials back where others could have picked it up. (Though my wardrobe is full of those shirts they pass out at tech events. I haven't bought new shirts since.

I want to urge all of you to rethink about the essentials in your life that makes you happy, then minimize everything else. For many of us, it could be family, friends, a smart phone, a laptop, two pair of shoes, a dozen shirts, 4 pairs of jeans, one set of formal wear, dozen pairs of underwear, dozen pairs of socks, a set of cookingware, a broom, a mop, a towel, a bed, toiletries. You don't have to extreme of course, just cut more of the shallow stuff out so you can enjoy the things you truly appreciate.

Cancelled flights. Stomach flus. Rude people. Spotty cell phone coverage. Getting ripped off. These are all little things, and usually the products of my own creation, but they make me mad anyway. 

It helps to put things in perspective. I think about my lucky breaks and near misses. When I was 12, two friends and I trespassed on private property to explore a cave, and an man standing in the field fired a shotgun at us. He was far enough away that the shot bounced off our skin. If he'd been closer we could have been injured or worse. 

In college I was walking at night with a friend and a car pulled up and the passenger pointed a pistol at us. Idiotically, I walked up to him and asked him what kind of gun it was. He was so nonplussed that he told me the make and model of his pistol and then ordered the driver to drive away. 

Another time I was driving with friends in my car in Boulder, Colorado. This was 1982 or so. It was two in the morning and the car was rattling with empty beer cans. As I drove, I wondered why the traffic lights were all out. A police car pulled us over. He told me I was driving the wrong way down a one way street. He asked me to step out of the car, and shined his flashlight in the car. He saw all the beer cans. He took my license and told me to wait by the car, then went into his car to radio back to the station. Five minutes later he got out of the car and said, ""Turn your car around and go home."" And then he got in his car and drove away.  I still have no idea why he didn't at least give me a ticket for having and open container and for driving the wrong way. 

My lucky breaks have outnumbered my unlucky ones, and I'm very grateful.

There is this giant, nerdy convention happening in Seattle right now. PAX Prime. Maybe you've heard of it? Anyway, it's a place for fans to learn about new games (video, computer, board, etc.) and meet creators and hang out with each other. It's loads of fun.

My dark secret? I hate the comic that inspires this convention. Penny Arcade features some of the most annoying characters that have said some terribly misogynistic things in the past. Things that fanboys (and maybe fangirls) like to hash over and over again. And yet, I still support the community.

This might make me the worst feminist ever, but I believe the Penny Arcade folks atone for their terribleness by hosting cool events like PAX and their charity that gives video games to kids in hospitals.

I want to tell you about love. I wish people were less scared to say “I love you” because more people need to hear that they are loved.

I want to tell you about traveling and how it should be pursued early and often.

I want to tell you about writing and how you should not fear your own words or thoughts, even though I will censor myself as I write this.

I want to inspire you.

I want to make you laugh.

But today, I am not feeling light. Summer, my favorite season, is nearly over. Acorns are falling. Some leaves are beginning to brown on their branches. Change is in the air.

It’s the first day of second grade for my oldest son, an occasion that is both joyous and melancholy. I got up earlier than usual today, made breakfast, got him and his brother dressed in new clothes. They goofed off while I took photos of them standing by the flowering crepe myrtle in front of our house.

The younger brother—aged four and three-quarters and still in preschool — wore sunglasses for the photos, just like last year. He’s the confident one, he’s the silly one. He’s going to be the kid that holds court in the classroom, with guys and girls gathered ‘round to hear his jokes and stories.

I’m not sure what the future holds for my oldest boy, the one who has mild autism. He has been so excited for this day to come. School provides him a schedule; he craves routine. Still, as I left him this morning, he gave me a worried look. I couldn’t hear him over the din of the other children in the cafeteria, but I could see him say, “See you at 3:30.” He needed to know I would be there.

Each school year means a new teacher, who may or may not know the best way to handle my son’s idiosyncracies. There’s also the concern of whether he will make friends — will other kids invite him to birthday parties and play dates? My son is well known at his current school thanks to his lovable nature, his precocious math skills, and his ability to memorize everything from people’s birthdays to the exact length of nearly every song on my phone. Yet I know that as he ages, the chances of him being bullied for his differences will increase.

My family will be moving abroad next year, as we do every two to five years. While I am excited to introduce my sons to a new culture, the thought of starting from scratch — enrolling in a new school, finding new therapists, doctors, teachers, and caregivers — was enough to make me weep this morning. Maybe the new school will be wonderful and my son’s new peers will be kind and understanding. I am hopeful it will all work out, but the prospect of starting over fills me with angst.

Albert Einstein once said, “I never think of the future — it comes soon enough.” The physicist for whom our local high school is named is also believed to have been on the autism spectrum. I doubt my son will be the next Einstein. But I do hope that he will find his calling; that he will excel despite (or because) of his quirks; and that one day soon when I have to walk away from him, he will give me a smile — a simple acknowledgement that he is not worried and will be fine on his own.

He is also a gentleman who loves holding doors open for people, loves helping strangers anytime he can. Like most men his age, he loves video games and pretty girls. Unlike most men his age, he is not planning a career. He will most likely never get married. Our highest ambitions for him involve things like Supported Employment and Group Homes. But that's okay.

After all, what are our highest ambitions for any of our children? For them to be a doctor, a lawyer, a businessman/woman? No, not when you get right down to it. Most parents I know have dreams for their children that are much more basic. For them to have a good life. A happy life. Friends, family, joy, love. My son will have all of that, in abundance.

I became an advocate while raising him. At first, I was advocating for him. Then I gradually started coaching his classmates' parents on how to advocate for their children. Then I met and coached other families. Then I discovered an amazing training and leadership program called Partners in Policymaking. Participating in this program was truly a life changing experience for me.

Partners in Policymaking is for parents of those with, or self advocates with, developmental disabilities. It is offered in almost every state of the nation, as well as many countries throughout the world. It started in Minnesota in 1987, and has turned out 23,000 graduates since them. If you are a person with a developmental disability, or the parent of a child with the same, I highly recommend seeking out and attending this program. It has made me a better parent, a better advocate, and a better person. I learned that I have power. If I don't like the way 'the system' works, I can change it. If I can't find a service or support that I need, I can create it, or be instrumental in helping it be created.

We are lucky here in Delaware, as our state offers a 'Junior Partners in Policymaking'. This past summer, both my son and my daughter attended that program. My daughter had already known her power to create those things she wants in her life but couldn't find, which is what drove her to build a support group for siblings of those with disabilities. It's a fledgling group, still trying to find its legs, but she is pushing for it with grace and persistence.

If you have a child with developmental disabilities, or have developmental disabilities yourself, look for Partners in Policymaking in your state, in your country. If you can't find it, track down whatever groups or agencies support this population, and let them know about it. Make it happen for yourself and those around you. It will help bring amazing positive change to your world.

If you want to learn more about the program, or hey, about my kids, let me know. :)

I was trying to get over a loss, and I'd spent more than a year hiding away, avoiding friends, conversations, or challenges. Life wasn't really going anywhere.

Come May and a beautiful springtime, I decided I had to do something to snap out of it. I drove a couple hours out of town and set out on a hiking trail I'd never been on before. I'd heard something about being in nature as a cure for all stresses, or exercise as a mood fix, or something. It had sounded right. I hoped to be entirely alone in the woods, and to emerge at the end of the day finally happy again.

After an hour and a half of walking, and encountering maybe two or three other people, I came out onto a bay on the lake. The pebble beach stretched a couple hundred metres in a wide curve, and the water was still. As I walked along the beach, I noticed how many butterflies were sunning themselves on the rocks.

It was quiet, and warm, and I was looking for an epiphany. I took off my clothes, nervously (I'd never done this before!) and immersed myself in the lake. It was a little bit cold and I was afraid someone else would come along. As I got out, I disturbed a group of sleeping butterflies, and they all flew up around me, swirling, black and yellow. It was beautiful. I stood with my arms outstretched and let them surround me.

This is it, I thought. My mind feels light and free. I have fixed my life, and everything will now be good.

It wasn't, of course. I drove home again and everything was as it had been. But over the next year things did get better, a day at a time, just letting time take its course.

I've never told this story to anyone before.

When I was younger I had aspirations to do two things: to become a biologist and to write music.  Those pursuits were intended to give a backbone to my life.  To expand the boundaries of human knowledge and to create a permanent record of my thoughts passed down through the ages.

As I got older those things became less satisfying.  The realities of life as a biologist turned me off from pursuing it as a career.  As for music, the idea that it is in any way permanent began to feel absurd.  Technology and ephemeral taste and the vast expanse of existing music will certainly obliterate anything I create over a couple hundred years. A thousand and I'm definitely toast.

Without those guiding principles in my life though, I'm not sure how to feel about my time on earth. I've found a profession I can sustain, but the world is not enriched by my output.  I wouldn't even know what kind of work would enrich the world. Life has simply come to feel curiously meaningless.  Not in a depressing way, I just feel now that I'm an observer.  I feel like I'm just smelling the flowers, diverting myself before I go off to die.

It's not a terrible outlook, in fact I consider myself very lucky in my circumstances on earth, but it's not exactly pleasant either.  I'm curios if you've encountered this feeling -- I'd love to know how you've dealt with it, particularly if you are older.

I have to confess I’ve not been keeping up with my Listserv reading so if you’re reading this let me first say thank you for indulging me a few moments.

I live in a desert in the north west of Australia, what I like to call Mad Max country. As a result my oldest son goes to boarding school far away and we see him once a month. This has been hard on me (not on him, he loves it) as I always wanted to be there for all his experiences.

So I wanted to share a little something with him, and I guess all of you, about love and about his mother.

I had known Gayle for a few years in passing as a friend, actually a girlfriend, of a friend. After I’d been away for a while, I went for drinks with friends at the house she was living at. She was single at the time and so was I and during the slightly intoxicated chatting we accidentally finished each other’s sentence. We glanced at each other, she smiled slyly, I grinned like a Muppet, and a spark leapt between us.

I know, I know; it sounds painfully cliché. We might as well be bumping into each other on a snowy night in New York and getting Christmas presents mixed up. But I swear that’s how it happened. The spark was soon followed by thunder bolts, fireworks, the whole deal.

Admittedly we both tried to play it cool at first, or at least convince ourselves we were playing it cool. But nine months later I cracked, I was away for work again at a resort at a nearby island called Rottnest (supposedly Dutch for Rats Nest as the poor Danish explorers thought the tiny kangaroo type marsupials called Quokkas were giant rats), when I called her and asked her to marry me. We threw together an amazing wedding in three weeks and have spent the last decade and a half on our honeymoon.

Now my son, and you, might ask why I was so damn sure about this girl. But I didn’t really do any maths over it, It just seemed like destiny. But looking back now I see so many things about my wife I desired, her strength, her independence, her passion, her kindness, her intelligence and her considerable beauty; faced with all that when it came to loving her I didn’t have a choice.

Love should always be easy, marriage is hard and takes work, relationships are hard, but the love should be easy. If you’re in a relationship and the love is tough work but the relationship is easy, then it’s not going to work, bad news, your dating someone you should be friends with.

Get rid of lists and all preconceived notions. If you’re looking for someone in a select range of interests, or of a particular appearance, you’re setting yourself up to fail. Because when love strikes it ignores all of that.

When it does happen, when you know, it’s indescribably wonderful, you feel like the luckiest person in the world. And no matter how much of a sceptical, cynical smart arse I claim to be, and I do, I absolutely believe in that one small piece of magic that can happen between two people. That spark that seems so ethereal, seemingly magical, that you hear many people express doubts it exists all together. But I have never doubted its existence.

Because it happened to me.

Learning to program is easier than learning a foreign language (I speak three and code, so I can compare). Once you know how to program, you can build things you are passionate about and hopefully make the world a better place.

But all my friends said ""NO LIFE ADVICE!""

So instead, here are a series of short bedtime stories told to me by my daughter, Olivia (5). Note, Henry is her brother, 22 months old, recently adopted; these stories were told before he came home to us, when he was just a picture and a name, an unknown quantity to her:

March 23 2013: OK dad. So Henry went to the park! All by himself. He went to the park and he climb up in the tree. And then he fell down! OH NO! and he got a bloody. On his arm! So you have to put a band aid on it. Next time I will go with him to the park and say NO HENRY, YOU DO NOT CLIMB A TREE, YOU ARE TOO LITTLE. And if he goes in the tree and fall down I will catch him, but then he has a time out, because climbing trees is DAMEROUS. And then Henry grew up. And he is going to be a bug doctor. What do you call that? (an entomologist). Yes, He will be an entomologus. I will catch the bugs, and he will look at them. We will go to college! The end. Daddy, you can send in mommy now, I am ready to go to bed.

April 1 2013: Henry went on a picnu - picun - picnic - daddy is that right? (yes.) Henry went on a picnic. he went on the table. Mommy said ""Henry! Get off the table!"" So he did. Then he went on the horsey [referring to the carousel at Funderland]. He rode on the gray horse. But then he saw a big, giant, really big bug! (what did he do?) He shoot it! (what is shooting?) You know. Shooting, is like hitting. (what did he shoot it with?) Daddy you know, you can only shoot with a shovel. (ok.) So he got the bug! But he missed the bug and he hit the gray horsey, and it broke! So, BIG TROUBLE. Then he went on an airplane, because he had to go up in the sky. On an airplane! Daddy! Then his mommy said COME BACK HERE! (who is his mommy?) her name is Jineui. (is that your mommy?) Daddy, it's the same person! Then we go home, and it's bedtime. OK, give me a kiss, and go send in mommy.

April 2 2013: Daddy, here’s the story. Listen. Henry went on a submarine - wait. Atchuly, Henry and Jude and Olivia went on the mountain. They packed their packback - I mean backpack - and their lunchboxes. They brought apples. To eat. And they brought their ladybugs, and their spiders. (why did they bring ladybugs and spiders?) I don’t know. And they brought books. And they went up the mountain. It was very heavy! So daddy, you ride the elephant, and take the backpacks and lunchboxes up the mountain and we will walk. And then you can go on the elevator to the top. (does the elephant go in the elevator too?) No, it’s too big. Maybe the elephant can go in the elevator later when it gets smaller. And we went up the mountain. Daddy, I will tell you the rest of the story in the morning, OK? Now send in mommy. We will have blueberries for breakfast. Goodnight!

April 24 2013: One day, Henry went on an airplane. (puts hand up) (what’s wrong?) I’m pausing the story. (long pause) The airplane was really big and it had a giant bunny on it, and also a very big toilet. The plane was bumping, and Henry went to the bathroom - and he bumped his head on the toilet! (oh no!) It’s OK - I put ice on it, and he was better. (good!) Then I flushed him! (oh no! Was he OK?) It’s OK. I just flushed the pee. Then Henry went outside and got his purse. Goodnight, daddy.

May 16 2013: One day there was a tiny little mouse. And Henry chased the mouse, and he caught it! It was a gentle one. Everybody was happy! But you have to be careful with a mouse, because it could hurt you. (how would a mouse hurt you?) A mouse could bite you, and you would be bloody and it would hurt very much! (how big is this mouse?) It is a very small mouse, you can’t see it. (that’s really small!) Watch out daddy because the mouse is not clean so don’t touch it. Goodnight.

That's the news from Sacramento, California. To spite my friends, here's one tiny bit of life advice, from an unreconstructed radical anarchist to all of you out there: Speak softly. Spend carefully. Tread lightly. Choose wisely. Be kind. That's it.

I don’t know why I joined, it just seemed like something to do at the time.  Everybody loves a fire truck, and the station was covered in photographs from before my grandparents were even born.  The people had a dry, morbid sense of humor, which seemed to fit my personality.  It seemed like it would be something different to do with my days.

I passed fire school, got a few years of experience under my belt, and decided that I wanted to do this for a living.  2 years and 3 applications later, I was accepted into the Baltimore City Fire Department in 2008.  I began the fire academy.

More push-ups and yelling than I could have ever expected, but I learned all of the quirks that my local county training had never taught me. Baltimore was much different than little old York ever was.  I learned about checking your hydrants for drugs or guns before hooking up and charging supply lines. I learned never to stand directly in front of a door after knocking on it, in case somebody decided to shoot first and ask questions later.  I learned how to survive in a big city.

Many of our citizens are below the poverty level, and are uninsured or severely underinsured.  Working in Baltimore City means that I became an emergency medical technician in the academy (it’s a requirement). I spend my days cleaning up things that have shown me the worst parts of humanity.  It’s quite easy to become jaded.  Anyone who has ever been to Baltimore knows that it’s rough down here.  We don’t have the arson problem to the extent that Detroit does, but we have no shortage of violence.  I think we could easily compete with Chicago any day.

The only thing that we ask of our citizens is to remember us come budget time.  We don’t need much, just fire engines that pump water and medics that don’t break down in the middle of a run.  Right now, I personally have seen patients wait upwards of 1+ hour for an ambulance and I’ve seen engines that wouldn’t pump water at a fire.  Sometimes, it seems like we’re always on the chopping block, and it sucks knowing that someone is dead or a house collapsed because of equipment failure.  I think that without good paramedics and functioning ambulances, our death by homicide rate would be much higher.

Just a few things you can do:

·         Remember the ones who lose their lives doing this job.  343 in New York City, 9 in Charleston, 10 in West Texas, 19 in Arizona, and the ones here and there that are all gone because of their bravery.

·         Visit your local firehouse.  The history there will amaze you, the people will humor you, and it makes a great trip for those of you with children.

·         Slow down!  If it isn’t fire or heart attacks that kill us, it’s people driving too fast down a highway even after they see the big red truck with the flashing lights.

·         If you ever go the 9/11 memorial, make sure to visit Engine/Truck 10 right across the street.  Their website tells an incredible story of that morning, and the plaque on the side of the firehouse is incredible and moving.

Join.  Many small towns are protected solely by volunteers, and the fire service has a pension for pulling all types of people.

August 2013,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/08/19/death-to-normalcy/,"August 2013, 19",Death to Normalcy!,"GISHWHES. The Greatest International Scavenger Hunt the World Has Ever Seen. This year, it started at 9.08 GMT on Sunday 11th August. It’s officially the world’s largest scavenger hunt and it sees thousands of people going about doing crazy creative things for one week. I first took part last year, in the second GISHWHES and have decided that I’m just about recovered enough from last year to do it again now.

Deciding to join a GISHWHES team was probably one of the best decisions I made last year. I was contributing a little money towards the grand prize fund, and some to a charity that’s linked with the Hunt. GISHWHES joined me and my friends to a group of complete strangers that we had to work with to get the items completed. We ended up working on a 3 foot high dinosaur made of sanitary towels and a 12 foot long scarf.

The thing about GISHWHES is not the weird stuff you end up doing, or the slightly freaked out cashier at the till when you buy 20 packs of extra strong sanitary pads, but it’s the way it connected us to other crazy, like-minded people and the way we got to come out of our shells. GISHWHES was and still is a great excuse to just be a little weird every now and then. GISHWHES isn’t about who has the most money or which team has the most creative people; it’s about changing the world for the better and while you’re at it, changing yourself and having fun too.

We didn’t win last year, I don’t even think we came very close, but we all had great fun and did things we hadn’t done before. We helped out some people doing a sponsored hitch-hike in return for help completing an item on our list, we met new people and while we didn’t get to take a trip to a haunted Scottish mansion with an actor, we had that week of pure concentrated fun.

When I first found out that I’d won the Listserve lottery, I asked almost everyone I know what they would write about if they were me. My mum said something conveying a ‘carpe diem’ sort of message; my sister said something political; my god parents said women’s rights. I thought I’d tell you about GISHWHES because it’s something I believe in, even if it sounds trivial to say ‘I believe in a media scavenger hunt’. GISHWHES allows you to let out your inner creative genius and enjoy a bit of childish glee.

I think more people should stop concerning themselves with labels and politics so much and start trying to enjoy life a little more.

Enjoy your life,

August 2013,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/08/18/a-matter-of-words-words-that-matter/,"August 2013, 18","A Matter of Words, Words that Matter","For the last decade I have studied and taught courses in Communication and Rhetoric and I am always surprised at how easily people overlook the role communication plays in our lives. While we often speak in clichés like actions speak louder than words, we forget how intimately tied words and actions are. We establish credibility with others, build relationships, and maintain the minutiae of daily life with and through communication. Instead of lamenting that a person or a politician is all rhetoric and no action, take some time to think about how our shared cultural values generate the rhetoric we use and connect to the actions we do and do not take.

Because our words and actions are so closely connected I want to take the opportunity the Listserve has provided to encourage you to be more mindful of how you communicate. These are a few tips and suggestions I often share with my students in an attempt to encourage more careful and mindful communication. While none of them are earth shattering, when I work carefully at using them in my everyday life I can see the quality of the relationships around me improve.

First, the best piece of advice I have ever received about communication came from my mentor. He was fond of saying “Listening is an ethical choice we make.” Hearing as an auditory capacity is not the same as listening. Listening is an intensive activity. Listening requires vulnerability. Listening and willing to be vulnerable to what someone has to say allows us to communicate in a more open environment. We often fail to listen because we allow our predispositions to block communication before it ever begins.

Second, be active in your communication. We often thoughtlessly react to what others say. This begins a negative chain of communication that can be counter-productive. Beyond failing to listen, we utter the first thing we think of and we fail to be active and mindful. If we communicate more creatively and more actively we can avoid reacting to others and damaging relationships with those around us.

Last, don’t get hung up on assuming the intent of the person communicating with you. What I mean is, it is impossible to know for sure what a person intended to mean when they say something to us. When I think of the missteps I make in everyday communication it is often because I assume why someone said something to me, I take offense at them for the purpose behind what they said. In reality, I can never know the intent behind their statement unless they tell me. Try and avoid making assumptions about the meaning of, and purpose behind, someone’s statement and see how it changes the flow of your communication.

These three tips are small but intensive suggestions. Practicing them all the time is difficult and I fail to do so far more often than I would like to admit. However, I find that when I put these tips into practice I am a better communicator. That said these tips are also not a panacea. They will not fix every problem you have. In closing, I would love to hear what you struggle with or excel at when you communicate with others. Reach out to me via email at  or via twitter @AcaGuy.

I’m just passing along borrowed ""words of wisdom"" that I've received and keep coming back to. Hopefully they will mean something to some of you too.

1)      Read Panarchy by Lance Gunderson and C.S. Holling. I have to admit I haven’t read the entire book, but the premise itself is worth sharing.  To me the book is about our innate fear/inability to deal with change. The idea is that in nature, as well as in our day-to-day life, things are in a constant state of flux - growth and decline. This happens for a lot of predictable and unpredictable reasons. But nature deals with change much more gracefully than humans do and we can learn a lot from natural systems. The book applies to every aspect of human life from relationships, to running a company, to planning a city, the list goes on. What I’ve taken from the book (these are my words, not the authors’) is that we have to expect that things won’t always be going well, stable or growing. We have to expect periods of decline and disorder (think of things moving along a figure 8). If we expect it we might become better at dealing with it. The book is out of print but available on Amazon. I guess the book stuck with me because it changed my perspective on a lot of things.

2)      Food advice: Google “Glory Bowl.” I recommend making it with grated zucchini and broccoli and replacing the tofu and rice with black beans and quinoa. You can thank me later :-)

3)      On quarter-life crises: I’ve struggled a lot with the desire to travel and live in new places versus settling down in one place and starting my career. Though I don’t think there is a right answer, many good friends have reminded me that as wonderful as it is to move and travel and to keep a bucket list, at the end of the day it is important to “create yourself” and to focus on the relationships that matter. People are more important than places. I’m at a point where I’m feeling really lucky to have crossed paths with so many inspiring and courageous people and to be doing something I enjoy near the people that matter to me most.

Now I’m going to try to do something creative, bear with me.

I’m currently studying urban planning in Toronto, Canada. With that said I would really love for you to e-mail me a photo of one of your favourite places in the city/town you live in and a sentence or two about what you love most about where you live. My goal is to eventually collate everything and create something to share with you.

Don’t forget to laugh and indulge in a little chocolate and/or wine every day.

Much love,

Much too long in fact.    There has always been some reason to not write.  Some more legitimate than others.  But the desire to put pen to paper has always been there.  And as time and life have progressed, the need to just sit down and dump the weight of my world onto a blank page has become overwhelmingly cathartic.

 I have long felt the need to start some kind of an online journal or blog, not just to share my life but also share in the lives of others.  In the end, I think I just needed something to force me out of my shell, push me over the edge and put myself out there on the interwebs.

 I can’t think of a better opportunity to do so than The Listserve project, and I am grateful for the chance to read about your lives and share a bit about mine.

It feels like I have lived more than my share of life in 33 years.  Far more than I can boil down into a 600 word email.  I have traveled the world, married the love of my life, and started a beautiful little family.  I helped start and ultimately ran a nonprofit working with AIDS Orphans in Southern Africa, worked in politics in Washington, and currently have a successful career as a commercial real estate executive.

I have also been broke, anxious, depressed, and have seen a good bit of tragedy.  I abruptly lost a number of close loved ones, most recently including my wife’s 28 year old brother and my infant son.  I also almost lost my wife, who continues to have health problems that now prevent us from having additional children and may eventually reduce her longevity.

The details of these stories will have to wait for another day.  But the thing that I really want to share is the impact that they have had on my life.

G.K. Chesterton once wrote that “An adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered.  An inconvenience is an adventure wrongly considered.”  Certainly, a number of these events in my life are far greater in significance than an minor inconvenience, but I think that despite their scale, Chesterton’s words have remained true throughout the highs and lows of my personal journey.

For me, enduring the valleys in life and enjoying the peaks, are possible through only the pursuit of proper perspective.  The key has been to focus on the balance between the two and to realize that in most things, the journey really is the destination.  Life is a grand adventure that we travel together, and we would be right to consider it that way.

I believe that there is value in our individual stories and the relationships they create.  We can glean truth from exploring the journey of others.

To that end, I would like to make a request:

I would love to hear more about you and your travels/passions/losses/failures, etc.

On my end, I will commit to begin publishing my story and the lessons I have learned on a new blog.  In exchange, I want to encourage you to put yourself out there and tell your story.  Even if you don’t feel comfortable connecting directly with me or other members of The Listserve, please post it somewhere on the web or somewhere in your corner of the world.  Whether you realize it or not, your experiences and stories can benefit others and bring the perspective and balance that we all desperately need.

August 2013,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/08/13/for-the-love-of-beer/,"August 2013, 13",For the love of beer,"Beer.

I spent a large chunk of my childhood in Germany (in Bavaria and Schwabia to be exact) and thus was inculcated from a very early age with the bias that German beer is superior to every other beer. While that bias was difficult to overcome, it finally happened during my first trip with my beer nerd boyfriend—to Belgium. Beyond gorging ourselves on chocolate while there, we spent a lot of time in various beer bars and breweries, drinking lambics and observing the culture. If you guys ever get a chance to go to Belgium, I would highly recommend you go out of your way to visit breweries like Cantillon or De Struise; even Delirium Cafe in the heart of Brussels will give you a sense of it (but don't drink Delirium, use the bottle list). By the end of the trip, I was just so obsessed with the culture and sour beer that I was forced to accept that while German beer is absolutely fantastic, there is a whole world of beer out there that is just waiting for you to discover it.

So how to whittle my favorite things about beer down into the few words that I am allowed? How about I list my top 3 breweries:

De Struise. Yes, I have bias because of my experience there, and I love the fact that it was started by 4 buddies who brewed beer to take along on their hikes with them and eventually made it a business when they realized that the beer they were making was amazing, but the important part is that the beer they were and still are making is absolutely amazing. Really. Go try it. Belgian styles, American styles, German styles, every one of their offerings falls somewhere in the gamut from extremely solid to transcendental.

Hill Farmstead. While Shaun Hill may have settled back into his old family farm in the middle of nowhere Vermont, and while and he cares deeply about keeping his beer fresh and local so you'd be very lucky to see it elsewhere, what matters is that absolutely all he cares about is brewing the best beer he possibly can. It's tough to get, but good lord is it fantastic if you find it. I think he makes the best IPAs and saisons in the world, and every beer I've had from him is world class. Take a New England vacation and go there. Cantillon. The most beloved and highly regarded lambic producer, and the accolades are well deserved. They're known for being more sharp, puckering and acidic than the likes of Girardin or 3 Fonteinen, and for my money you can't get a better fruit lambic in the world. Stop messing with the ""americanized"" and sweetened Lindeman's and St. Louis fruit lambics, and try the real stuff.  In the end, my favorite thing about the beer is the culture. I spend a lot of my afternoons in beer bars just shooting the shit with the bartenders and let me tell you, they are a relaxed, kind and genuine bunch. They know their stuff, but they don’t flaunt it and they love what they do. So if you have time this afternoon or in the next couple of months, go to a local beer bar or brewery and ask them to tell you a little bit about how they make their beer and try to taste the bite of white grapefruit in a leanly malted IPA, or smell the bits of vanilla and chocolate ganache in a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout.

I would love to hear your beer stories! I also am obsessed with literature (please read The Unbearable Lightness of Being) and art (my dream is to travel down to Texas to see the Rothko Chapel, so if you have an extra couch to crash on in the area, let me know) and ice hockey (go caps!) and just about anything and everything else. So shoot me a line if you have some extra time.

I'm 40 years old and I was hoping someone could help me. I'm at a time in my life where I just don't know what to do. I wish to have a better job, a better paying job. But I was foolish and never went to college. I think I'd make a great nurse, but I can't afford to go back full time, and going at night would take about 6 or so years. 

I make about $30,000 a year. It's an okay amount, but I can't take care of myself. What would happen if my husband got sick and no longer could work? What would happen if we divorced? 

I push paper around. It's so boring. It's the same thing every day. 

What are some positions I could look into that pay a bit more? I am now making an amount that I think is the most a company would be willing to pay me without additional schooling. 

What are some careers I could learn in 2 years including prereqs? A 2 year program at night would probably be around 4 years... 

I find that all the research I've done is misleading. I read I can become a nurse in 2 years... but then I read you must already have an associates degree. So then it's 4 years, which would take me 6 years or more to complete.

Space and time: We cannot distinguish time from space. We find time through space. Visualize an image where nothing changes. No time detectable. Visualize an image... and change the image. You can measure time in the ratio between the first and the second.

A difference in space means a difference in time. Imagining a future where humans dominate the earth and manufacturing centers, shopping malls and entertainment houses sit proudly where less intelligent species failed to muster a proper defense to xenocide in the name of culture. This visualized space will take time to implement.

Many people would be more comfortable browsing the hemorrhoid treatment aisle in the drug store than the self-help aisle of the library.  ""What if someone SEES me?!""

But when it comes to real relief from pain and the end of discomfort, the self-help aisle is where it's at, homies!

Life is challenging.  We fail at things.  People disappoint us.  People die.  Relationships don't work out.  We make bad decisions.  Or even worse, we make decisions and then we can't TELL if they're good or bad so we drive ourselves crazy about it all.  Growing up is weird and nobody knows if they're doing it right.

Why not get help from really smart, compassionate people who have thought a lot about what makes human beings happy and fulfilled?

Why does ""self-improvement"" get the stigma?  I don't get it.  I mean, if we aren't about improving ourselves with the short amount of time we have in the world, then what the heck are we about?

I buy self-help books and I have an amazing girlfriend.  I've worked with a life coach and I was a college athlete.  I attend self-improvement seminars and I have a job that I love.  These are not mutually exclusive things.  In fact, it is largely BECAUSE OF the self-help stuff and the self-knowledge that comes with it that my life has improved.  And I hope it continues to improve because I'm still too much inside my own head about things.  On a daily basis I still think that I'm not enough, that people don't like me, that I walk funny, that I'm not capable of being a good friend, that something is wrong with me because I'm almost 30 and I still get zits sometimes, especially after shaving.  These are my hangups.  There are more.

I'm sure you have your hangups too.  The thing is, there are TONS of great books and people out there who can help us live more generous and authentic lives.  And they're available as soon as we ditch this stigma around ""self-help.""

Self-help isn't for losers.  Self-help is for badasses like us who are up to big things.  I get to say that.  Because one time, a plurality of public high school kids said I was the king of their very important dance.

I come from the vast and diverse land, India, where Education is given the top most priority in our lives. In fact, most of our parents decide what we will study even before we are born. I often come across people who say that the Education system is broken. I beg to differ. The system is not broken, rather it's becoming less relevant as we enter into a new era. 

Henry Ford, once said, You cannot learn in School what the World is going to do tomorrow. How true! A majority of our time (20-23 years! GOSH!) is spent in school. Rather than preparing us for the world and teaching us real skills, we are asked to mug up answers and spit it out in examinations. My country will have a huge population of youth by the end of this decade - And many of these will turn out to be unskilled. Our biggest asset may turn out to be our biggest liability. 

How am I solving this? After I graduated, I started up with my startup - LearnFlow. We train individuals who are about to face the industry on developing their skills. To start with, my co-founder and I started with developing their coding skills ( as we feel coding helps students solve real life problems ) but we are now expanding into other skills.

and here is where I need your help, ListServers! I would love to hear from you, your vision of the Education System. And what are the skills you think that should be imparted to the youth as we move forward?

Looking forward to your replies. 

Sincerely,

August 2013,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/08/08/what-exactly-is-happening-here/,"August 2013, 08",What exactly is happening here?,"The listserve. The listserve is so invigorating, and yet I'm not sure how to express myself and open the conversation I'm looking for without something semi-confessional.

I guess I'll start here: when I was about 5 years old, I loved to hug. Not just hugs themselves, but the act of hugging. My family members always found me clutching around their knees or their stomachs that were too large for me to wrap my arms around. I interrupted class and visits to my ailing grandfather and movie theaters with hugs. When I went to summer camp, I'd stop playing baseball or hop off the monkey bars to give my counselors hugs. I can't imagine 15 and 16-year-olds particularly enjoyed that kind of attention, considering raging hormones and all. Nothing beat a good hug at that age; it was a way of feeling safe, and of feeling out another person in a way that conversation couldn't.

Anyway, I'm not sure when I grew out of hugs, but I did. I wish I hadn't, because the warmth, tenderness, and just emotional meaning transferred in a hug is unmatched. I'm now in my mid-20s, and hugs are for the most part a formality. Half of one is a greeting, a full one is displays closeness that may or may not be present. Becoming a nominal adult (I can't claim any type of maturity at this point) means finding more appropriate ways to express yourself, your affection, your needs. This is something I struggle with, because, for as much as the exterior appears rough and knobby, the same needs are there. A hug, a connection, some manner of dropping one's guard and being fully connected with the world, getting to the soul of another person or an experience.

The struggle is letting that happen, anyway. It might be that my current environs are too daunting to fully engage the people in it. It's just too dang large of a city. But that's not a proper excuse. Why should it be, how could it be? Why avert your eyes from people you don't know at all, instead of smiling and offering something, anything positive to their lives. The most respectable socializers are the people that sit in the park and will talk to anyone. That's how it seems to me, at least.

I don't know what I want to do with ""my future."" I'm not sure what my future is, at least in some post-facto, plotting-out-my-life-on-a-timeline kind of way. It might be a career, maybe in computers or maybe in writing or maybe in something I've not even thought about up to this point. It hopefully involves a wife and children and many nieces and nephews and more family. But I do hope that I still have at least 70% of my life ahead of me, because there are so many things I want to do. 

Chief among those things is bringing back the hug. Maybe by this, I mean something larger than an embrace. A hug might entail being present in your everyday life. It might mean engaging in some kind of love for the world around you and an appreciation of just existing and having this chance to live. That's it; a passion for the opportunity to live, to have life, existence, Sisyphus going up the mountain, etc. I'm not quite sure how to do this, which is why this confessional goes out to the listserve. My biggest question is how other people live and hug, so to speak, the world around them. Reach out.

August 2013,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/08/06/the-real-sex-revolution/,"August 2013, 06",The real sex revolution,"One of the things that have always filled me with curiosity is men’s attitude towards female sexuality. Even though they are supposed to want sex all the time, every time a girl actually satisfies that craving, most men act like real jerks and make her feel bad and not worthy of their attention/respect/kindness.

I will drop a bomb at you: women love sex. From my experience, I think that girls like sex even more than guys, but the rules that our western society has imposed to all of us, prevents us from really making the best of what nature has given us. I ask you guys: Do you have a part of your body which whole existence is just related to your pleasure? We do. Can you literally spend all your day having sex non-stop? We actually could (with proper training and the adequate inspiration :P)

So, why is all the fuzz with girls enjoying pleasure? Why do you think that the time that a girl prevents you from seeing her naked is directly proportional to their worth as a human being/possible partner.

What I think is that guys that think that are absolute jerks. And I have found the perfect way to spot them and get them out of your life: sleep with them. If you do that, and they never pursue anything else with you, it is because they are not worthy of your time. If you let yourself go and enjoy the moment, and he is able to notice that you are beautiful human being after seeing you naked, then you can see where things take you both.

So let’s start a revolution! The day in which all girls are able to enjoy sex with the people they are attracted to without being judged, that will be the day in which men will have to find more things to value in women than how much time can they hold sex. And that day, my friends, I think we will all be a little bit happier. Or, at least, have more fun.

August 2013,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/08/04/ever-tried-online-dating/,"August 2013, 04",Ever tried online dating?,"I've tried every dating site you can think of. I've tried big ones, small ones, free ones, expensive ones, exclusive ones and niche ones. For the last 6 years, on and off.

The one thing they have in common is that they're mostly rotten and dishonest. I'd say they're giving the industry a bad name, but they *are* the industry, and that's the problem.

Dating sites started in the 90s with good intentions. In the 00s, it all started going wrong. Smaller sites had to look big, so they made fake profiles and sent fake messages to their users to grab their subscription money. And unfortunately, nothing's really changed. If you live in the UK you might even have seen a Panorama documentary about it recently.

Free sites are spam-ridden cattlemarkets, where men send huge amounts of degrading, filthy and often bizarre messages to women, whose inboxes are so full that the genuine down-to-earth good guys are drowned out. Generally, if you're not willing to pay to find a match, your heart's not really in it (pun intended!).

Then the subscription-only sites are the way to go, right? Except they don't tell you when your matches were last online, they will often send pretend profile views and messages your way, and restrict anything that would allow you an informed choice - until you hand over your credit card info, at which point, you realise the three people you had your eye on have long moved on (or don't subscribe, and thus won't reply) - or that those messages you received weren't even real.

I'm probably preaching to the choir here. If you're dating online, you've already encountered all this I have no doubt. And it might seem like there's no choice, and that's largely true, as companies have to make a profit somewhere.

So I got sick of this, having dated online for years and learned of all the nasty tricks of the trade, and now I'm building my own site. It's called opendating dot co dot uk, and it will launch later this year. I'm really hoping to build something that will shake up the industry and give those evil big boys a run for their money. There will be no subscriptions, no fakes, and daters will have all the information they need about their matches before they hand any money over. It's going to be morally just and ethically minded, and I'm really excited at the thought of doing something that just feels *right*.

If you're interested, please do get in touch, especially if you're an online dater (or have been). I'd love to throw ideas around with any like-minded people, and your feedback really would be SO welcome. Tell me your tales of online dating woes. Any stories from people that have been successful while online dating would be lovely too - I know it's not all bad!

Oh and of course, sign up if you're looking for love. Perhaps I can be your Cupid... :)

It's called Terrible Nerd. It's available at Amazon for Kindle and as a dead-tree book.

Here's a tiny bit from the introduction:

""My generation was the first one to have access to computers at such a young age. In the early 1980s, middle class kids could get their hands on Apple //s and Commodore 64s, Atari 800s and TRS-80s, and other machines that offered the kind of computing power that would have been impossible just a few years before. While that level of power did exist just a few years before, it wouldn’t have been able to fit on your desk, nor was it affordable to anyone other than a university, corporation, or government. Here we were, kids embarking on the threshold of a whole new thing, which for us started out as a hobby, or a toy to play games on, and for many of us, ended up being our careers, sometimes defining the course of our lives.

My generation was the first to never handle a slide rule (except as a curiosity), because we were the first to have electronic calculators. We were the last to enjoy the smell of mimeographed worksheets in school, because of photocopiers. We were the first kids to enjoy home video games, MTV, and microwave ovens.""

In the book, I tell the true story of how I got my first computer (a Texas Instruments 99/4A) -- by stealing it -- from a church. I also tell the true story of how I once crashed the Internet for all of Europe  . . . by emailing too much porn. See, I'm a terrible nerd.

If you're a nerd too, you might enjoy it.

July 2013,31,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/07/31/aucka-paulie/,"July 2013, 31",Aucka Paulie,"My Uncle Paul was always a goofball. Growing up he was the one who would horse around with my cousins and me. He loved to go fishing, watch AHL from the front row of the arena while yelling as loud as he could at the opposing players and referees, and coaching his kids sports teams. Growing up my father would always take me to visit him and his son who was a couple years younger than me on the weekends, I knew exactly how long it took to get from our house to his by the time I was about 5.

The four of us were the group of guys who started the family tradition of traveling to the Connecticut Lakes every June for a week of fishing, hiking, canoeing and camping without any electricity or running water, about 20 miles from any sort of civilization in our family. He was always the guy who wanted to use the biggest minnow from the trap in the hopes of catching the biggest lake trout.

Me and Chris (my cousin) would run around the Springfield Civic Center watching the Falcons play amateur hockey while our fathers watched the game. Paul would buy the cheap seats and just go down to some empty seats on the glass as soon as the game started. From minute one until the end he would bang his mini hockey stick on the railing and heckle anyone who dared skate by. At first I was worried about getting thrown out of the arena just for being around him, then I began to think the ushers and security might have thought he was handicapped by the way he acted and the mullet he proudly sported.

If I were to put a 1-10 number on Pauls ambition in life I would set him at a 4. He didn't appear to aspire to be any greater than he was and as a janitor in a elementary school no one would consider him professionally successful. My dad told me when they were in high school Paul excelled at metal fabrication, one of the better fabricators he has met and that was as a teenager. Unfortunately the lubricant used in commercial fabrication changed, Paul was allergic to some part of it and his career ended. Maybe that is when his professional ambition ended and his just took what he could get. How many elementary school janitors do you know that have about 20 years in the school system by the time they are in their 40s?

As I grew up Paul kind of became my go to if I had some free time and was in his area, as well as being my first to call if I wanted to go on some little fishing excursion. I really loved being a young adult and driving him around, being able to make plans with him to do... whatever there was to do. When I spent the summer before I went into the military doing landscaping work I invited him along every day since he was out of school, when he declined I would just go buy him lunch from the classic diner down the road from his house. After that summer I left for the military and my closeness with everyone back home kind of started to dissipate. Don't get me wrong, I lost none of my love for him and the rest of my family but I spent the 95% of my time over 1000 miles away. I would visit once or twice a year, spread my time across all the friends and family I left behind.

In 2008 I had left the military but stayed in the south far from home. I was working in a restaurant when my dad called me repeatedly in the middle of dinner rush, so I stepped outside to talk with him, knowing it was some sort of emergency. I knew he was a mess as soon as he picked up, he was on a business trip but something bad happened at home, he didn't have all the answers but had to tell me what he knew until he could get home on the next flight out of there. Paul had jumped off a bridge into the river, not just any bridge but the South Hadley bridge, probably 100 feet off the water. The real problem was the Dam. Not far down river, maybe 1/4 mile, was Holyoke dam, a massive dam that poured over violently, so violent that when I was young we would go below it and my dad would use it as an example of how dangerous water could be. Paul went over the dam. Someone had spotted his body a ways down river, broken in so many places I don't even want to remember, but alive. It didn't take long to realize it was a suicide attempt, one that should have been successful. He was held in the hospital for the required time but released to go home under the supervision of family. Everyone around crowded around him for support and comfort, and we all wanted to know why he would do something like that, his daughter was in high school, his son had just graduated, his life seemed to be about where he had wanted it for the last couple decades. I finally was able to talk with him the day after he was released, he sounded in pain and very medicated, I asked why he would do that and if there was anything I could do for him, I would do anything in the world for him so he could ask anything of me. He said he was confused and tired, rambled about car trouble for a little while then I had to let him go because it became incoherent. Before we hung up I made him promise me that if he ever thought of something like that again he needed to call me, he was my family and one of my best friends. Shortly after that there was a small unsupervised window while one person had to go to work and the next was coming over. He did it again, only this time it worked.

On August 19, 2008 Paul D. Bliss killed himself. He left behind 2 children, 1 wife, a mother and father, 5 brothers and sisters, bunches nephews and nieces, friends, coworkers and people who he never even met but would have been better for being a part of his life.

I don't tell you this so you go out and tell the people you care about that you love them, I just wanted to talk about Paul. It still hurts to talk about Paul with my family, its hard, so I will tell a bunch of strangers.

Thanks.

I've always been told you can't have your cake and eat it too. But I don't like cake, I've always insisted on having pie on my birthday, and in the game of dessert rock paper scissors, strawberry-rhubarb pie would beat everything.

I've always wanted to be multi-lingual, but the closest I've ever come to fluency is in gibberish Italian during bouts of severe inebriation.... But trust me, my friend and I knew exactly what we were saying to each other....

Thunderstorms are sexy, I love fall and winter. And spring and summer. The smell of wet autumn leaves and baseball infield dirt. I love the silence of snow and bikes and smiling eyes and smiling lips and every genre of music, and family, friends, and god and philosophical discussions.

Sunset/dusk is  my favorite time of day. Something about the beautiful yet fleeting, transitory nature of the light sets off every excitement sensor in my brain.  It makes me want to just GOGOGO and do everything, all at once, while simultaneously just sitting and watching time slowly drift off. It is the slow slow erosion of one day, but it brings with it night, and all of the possibilities that go with it. Things are coming and going and there is change in the air, and maybe things will get even better.  It's this energy that really keeps me going and striving.  In some way, a sunset is a microcosm of day to day life.  Everyday something beautiful, that will never be here and be the same again. But not too far off, there is another one brewing for tomorrow, different in it's form, but possibly even better than today. Photographing every one I can is my way of stopping time and retaining my current emotion/elation and is my key to the past me, and well and the manifestation of my desire to share this beautiful feeling with as many as possible.

I'm using this email to share a few things I've been thinking about a lot recently. One has to do with friendships. The others with business. I'd love any thoughts you have on the topics.

First, a bit about me. I'm 22. From Cali. Went to Wharton in Pennsylvania. Dropped out to start a company in New York that sold this spring. Worked briefly in India and now I'm headed back to Wharton. I'm interested in most things.

With that, here are the questions. Would love to hear from you.	1.	On Friends — I have a bunch of longtime friends I've known since grade school who are like family. We hang out a lot, but most of what we do is kill time — watch movies, talk about sports (I don't watch sports), gossip, etc. How do I transition the dynamic so that we start doing more productive activities together? (ie reading, writing, drawing, making beer, taking dance lessons.) Do you do any stuff like this with friends?	2.	On jobs in the US — What will jobs in the US be in the future, assuming manufacturing continues to move to Asia and software continues to replace broker/admin/information jobs? Could it be that there is no solution within the national-industrial-market economy framework we've used the past 200 years? Do you see hints of an answer anywhere?	3.	On the US, China, and India — The writing is on the wall that India and China will replace the US as the most important economically and politically -- relegating the US to a Britain-like role of seniority or Japan-like role of next best. Given that assumption, how do we capitalize as western business people?	4.	On culture — Being exposed to foreign cultures is so valuable -- not for goodwill, though that too, but for helping people avoid narrow minded thinking about how things should be. How do we get more people exposed? Most people I know don't even leave the state they're born in. What if there were a way to connect with someone your age, gender, and profession in another country to chat? 	5.	On picking where you live — It seems to me that it is statistically impossible that most people are born in the optimal city. I think it's even more true as you get older that given your profession (banker, watch maker?) and preferences (outdoors, cold?) and such that there is a more optimal place you could be living. Why is it harder to find and move to a more optimal city in say Canada, or any foreign country, than your own. Why don't people shop for the right country? If you work on cars, wouldn't it make sense to at least consider living in Italy or Germany?

Would love to hear from you!

In my religious Muslim family, music is considered the voice of the devil.

I am torn between my passion and my fear of disappointing my parents.

We all have our excuses for not pursuing our dreams.

I’m sure you can relate.

I lost my voice the day I left the United States.

I have been silent for two years.

I cannot live in silence any longer.

My commitment: I will no longer live in fear.

On that day, I will kick off my journey to travel the world.  I will release my first music project online.

I may face hardships.

I may face limitations.

I will persevere.

Why travel the world? Beyond an obvious interest in people and culture, the reason I want to embark on a journey around the world is because I need to liberate myself and find a home. If I had a country I would just go to it but I carry a passport of a country that enslaves its own people. My nominal relationship with Eritrea has crippled me.  My fear of being sent there controlled me for the longest time and I finally said to myself:

""If I cannot go to Eritrea, I'll just go to every other country in this world.""

I’ll travel to get my voice back.

I’ll travel to live my passion.

This is what this journey is about. If you want to follow my journey, I’ve created a blog: mojoyeah dot com.

I teach.  From my experience I know that delivering content is good but getting people to actually do something is better, much better.  Two passions of mine are creativity and productivity, so in my 5 minutes of ListServe fame I want to get you productively being creative.

Here is a list of things for you to do over the next day or two:- Find the most interesting reflection (in a window, on water etc) you can.  You don't necessarily have to go searching specifically for this,  just notice reflections as you're going about your day to day activities.- Rearrange your desk.  Do more than just move an item for the sake of moving it though.  Think about all the items on your desk that have just been placed haphazardly.  Can you be more creative in how you organise them.- Get into a discussion with someone with very different views to you on a topic you are passionate about.  You must end the conversation by agreeing with their point of view however (just verbally,  I'm not asking you to actually change your point of view,  just to experience disagreeing with it).- Do some paper origami in your lunch break.  There are many great sites is you do a quick search with many great instructions.- Create a list of 10 simple but creative things you want to do over the next month.  Print it out and place it next to your desk, or bed or somewhere you will see it daily.  Tick them off as you go.

That's it.Simple, but you will have fun and be more creative.

Feel free to email me with any pictures or stories from doing these activities.  I'll collate them all and put them on a webpage for everyone to share.  Make sure the email subject has 'ListServe challenge' in it so I can easily organise them.

Have fun!

I'm young (going off to college in the fall) and still figuring things out, so I don't exactly have any great wisdom to give you all, sorry. I thought about not writing this however, but it seemed cool enough to be a shame to give up. I'm pretty busy with things right now, so this is mostly just a rough draft. I'll leave you with the last book I read and movie I watched, maybe you'll like them too; ""museum of innocence"" by Orhan Pamuk and ""Drive"". Both are pretty good I thought. 

Good luck with things.

July 2013,25,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/07/25/connections-and-collaborations/,"July 2013, 25",Connections and Collaborations,"It’s really easy for me to fall into a way of thinking that keeps me moving in the same direction.  I don’t like how my life feels when I let that happen for too long, so I give myself projects.  This coupled with some mild obsessive compulsive tendencies causes me to fixate on the end goal until I’ve thoroughly exhausted the point of the project.  Sometimes this leaves me very satisfied with what I’ve done/made/experienced and other times I find myself oddly ashamed or empty.

I don’t expect anyone to necessarily understand any of that, but I know how I feel when I’m in this kind of state and thought it could be helpful if others who might feel that way too knew they weren’t alone.

I’m working really hard on being vulnerable, too.  It’s a scary concept when you’ve spent your entire life believing (for good reason) that the best way to live is in a constant state of emotional vigilance.  I’m finding, though, that I’m not happy.  So I have made the decision to deliberately open myself up to all of the possibilities that vulnerability offers, both the good and the bad.  I try to remind myself that as painful as circumstances may get, they won’t kill me… and I’ll make my way through the worst.  Also, that it won’t be all bad… that I’m motivated by the good possibilities that I know exist.  It’s a foreign concept to me and difficult to execute throughout my life, but I’m committed to making that discomfort my new normal.

Speaking of projects, I have a couple of app ideas for smartphones that I really believe the world would benefit from but I’m not currently a developer.  I’m in the process of learning, but I don’t have the confidence in myself necessary to make these things the way I imagine them.  So, if you’re a developer and are open to partnering with me on one or two ideas, reach out to me and we can discuss how to make that happen.

I enjoy discussing meaningful topics:  politics, religion, ways to do life better….  I also enjoy a lot of different media, from music to books and shows.  So if you’d like to talk about any of these things and you find that it’s difficult or awkward to find a place to discuss these topics without encountering negative people or experiences, feel free to reach out to me.

I have no advice for anyone, but I’m happy to collaborate with any of you to make life better for us all.

Be and Stay Well.

July 2013,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/07/24/the-family-that-lists-together/,"July 2013, 24","The family that ""lists"" together...","It started innocently enough, this family list-making fetish. My husband, two children, and I were having a family conversation after dinner, and someone mentioned that it had been a while since anyone had spent the night with us. Something in me sparked an idea: how many people had indeed slept in our brick rancher over the years? The kiddos began rattling names of their friends while I got pen and paper and began recording. “Justin, Mark, Josh...” our son offered. Our daughter chimed in with “Amy, Ashley, Christine...”. My husband began reciting the names of relatives who have made the trek to visit us here in Alabama. Soon the list grew to over thirty people, which surprised us all. Then our son recalled that we hosted two young men from a visiting church choir one night; add two to the list! Didn't we shuffle beds around to accommodate our neighbor's parents when they paid a surprise visit? Add two more! And so it went, and when we felt we had exhausted all memory cells, nearly sixty names were scrawled on a piece of paper. We sat in the glow of that list, eating ice cream, remembering our visitors with warmth, and we did not know that the “after-dinner-making-a-list” tradition had begun.

In the coming years, we made lists short and long: states visited, movies that began with the letter “B”, dogs we had petted, restaurants at which we'd eaten, and types of Oreo's. Names of candy bars, state parks, car manufacturers, brands of toothpaste, and pro football teams. Perhaps we'd be planning a trip to an amusement park, and my son would express his desire to ride the newest coaster called the “Goliath” or some such thing. “What are the names of the coasters we've already ridden?” I'd ask, and, after the initial collective groan from hubby and the kids, we were off and running as names came from all directions: “Blue Streak!” “The Joker!” “Millennium Force!” and the list would grow to accommodate dozens of coaster names. Sometimes the compiling of the list was a sad action, as the death of a friend sparked a listing of “Who have we known and loved and lost?” and we became quiet as names were recorded and the list grew longer than we would have wanted.

Years went by and we continued with our lists, although as the children grew and spread their wings, the lists became more functional rather than for fun. Lists were made for what to bring to college, for people to contact as possible references, for repairs to be done around the house, for ways to earn income. And when our daughter married, the list of wedding-things-to-be-done achieved an epic level not seen before nor since.

The children are off on their own now, but we visit each other when we can. We recently spent four days together over a long weekend, and I felt the “urge” as we talked about board games that we enjoyed and micro-brews we might try. But as we played “Loaded Questions” and drank a flight of summer ales, I was too happy basking in the moment to write anything down. I looked around the room and observed my dear husband, our fun-loving son and his sweet girlfriend, our beautiful daughter and her smart husband, wonderful in-laws, smoked sausages, a bottle of bourbon, a sleeping dog, the sound of rain on the roof, a cozy blanket...wait a moment...could someone please hand me that paper and pencil?

Let me first tell you that please ignore my grammatical mistake as English is not my first language and secondly I very excited to share my story with you. I have no general theme in mind I will write whatever comes to my mind. Hope you will enjoy, reading as I am enjoying writing.

Everyone has the same question what should one write. I am a computer engineer 24 years old and live in a small town of India in state of Gujarat. Gujarati is my first language. I studied in an English medium school. And because I studied in an English medium school I can to talk to you. I thank my parents for what they have done for me. They have sacrificed many joys of their life to make my life better. I am Grateful to them and the Almighty. I am a happy go lucky guy. I live in the moment and believe that pain and sadness is momentary, and when it is too dark a sunrise is surely going to happen. I am still so young and what can share with you, teach you or say to you?

I wanted to become a Sound Engineer and a DJ. I like Trance music which is part of EDM (electronic Dance music). But that didn't happen and I instead took computer engineering as in hope that it will be a more useful skill. I have completed my bachelors in computer engineering. I also learn from online courses website such as corsera. I am currently learning Go language, and node.js language.  I also have a Certificate of accomplishment with distinction in Database Course from Stanford University for their online course.

Let's talk about dream. Everyone have goals and surely I have too. My short term dream is to buy a decent pair of headphones (currently I am saving money for decent audio-technica ath m50 headphones), a decent laptop (An MacBook Air this will take a lot of time as it is costly) and a decent internet connection. Long term goal is to be an entrepreneur.

To fulfill my goals I work hard and do freelance work in PHP, Web-application development, RESTful web API (Core php, Codeigniter, symfony2, Wordpress, etc.). I have excellent database skills and I am good at SQL(MySQL), NOSQL(mongodB) and XML (XPATH, XQuery) and JSON, I have decent knowledge of jQuery and angular.js framework. I can setup and configure amazon web servers. I am also good at writing spiders and crawlers.

I didn't had anything specific in mind. Hope you enjoyed reading.

If anyone needs help from my side in any way I will surely help, if anyone is hiring I will be more than happy to join. If you have freelance work for me contact me on

I sat in complete shock as to why me, out of 23,000 other people, got chosen for this insane opportunity to share anything and everything.

The Listserve accomplishes an amazing feat of connecting people through stories and that’s why I first signed up when I found out about it.  Every day, I have looked forward to read a snippet of another person's life and to be in their minds, even if it was for just 600 words or less.  Because I’ve enjoyed this aspect so much, here’s a little bit about me.

When I was 7 years old, my dad died of an infection.  It was the most devastating time of my life but I learned that life really does go on, even though at that moment it seemed like my whole world stopped.  Through endless love and support from my mom, I have grown into a person that I think he would have been proud of.  Going into my senior year of high school, I have so many things to look forward to.  I dream of attending Colorado College and just doing what I love to do.  I really have no idea what my profession will be or what my life will even be like a week from now, but what I do know is that I’m happy right now and in this moment.

Each person that resides on this planet has their own story.  It could be filled with heartbreaks and loss or opportunities and joy.  It is occupied by whatever you have been through, which is utterly unique to the story of the stranger who is standing next to you in line or your wife who is nestled in your arms.  In some remarkable way, these stories are intertwined in a spiderweb spanning across the entire earth.  We share commonalities that bring us together in a manner that is barely grasped.  But in the end, we are all connected.

Whether you stub your toe or break your foot, you still have a right to say “ouch”.

Our inherent humanity. Recognizing that our human experience transcends physical qualities, is a powerful notion. We as individuals are unique, but our commonality runs much deeper. As homo sapiens to our further primordial roots.  We each experience emotion through the same framework. Synapses and neural networks, electrochemical signals pulsating inside.  I am honored to be granted this opportunity to share. The listserv is a special community. 

If from this letter I can plant a seed in your mind and actions, that would benefit your experience, then my investment would forever be justified.---------- You cannot force lessons onto anyone. You can only offer ideas to ponder. A good teacher guides her students on a path of discovery. Through this self-discovery, we as students incorporate and ingrain lessons.   There are learning opportunities all around us. We are entities perceiving and absorbing experience, and manifesting emotion.  I am most amazed, at the power we have to influence ourselves and change our thinking. Novel experiences and ideas are the building blocks of growth. Self-Talk: Helmstetter will help you choose, then reinforce or replace habitual patterns. This powerful strategy of self-influence has helped mold me and granted tremendous personal conviction. My advice on moving past negative reactive states/triggers, is by recognizing the abstract space between stimuli and response. You will only find this within self-reflection. The more you actively and consciously, focus on this space, the stronger you develop your internal locus of control. Pause, before you have a typical reaction. Conceptualize on this gap of experience. Next time, pause a bit longer. You will start to gain control over your own mind. This is a practical exercise for you to consider for increasing active engagement. Awareness is important. You must see yourself from beyond your ego. Observe your ego, be curious of it, but remember you're not solely your own self-identity. Identity is important, but what else guides us? Step outside of your mental map to discover alternative truths. Perception is what guides our beliefs, determination builds our values, and attitude shapes our future. Peace in Every Step,  practice taking conscious breaths, pausing, and reminding yourself of how special it is, that we are even here. Diaphragmatic breathing. If you are curious to learn from some of my mentors, books that have had profound personal influence, Mastery: Leonard Flow: CsikszentmihalyInfluence: CialdiniBuddha's BrainWhack on-the-side of the head -------Learn financial literacy. Start with fundamentals: Interest-rate, inflation, compound-growth, investing and savings. Consider each $ you spend an investment into your happiness. Evaluate both your short and long-term desires. Live as you'll die tomorrow, but plan as you'll live forever. Defend your credit vigilantly. In a world with unprecedented central banking manipulation, your credit will become more valuable as time moves forward. ---Write your thoughts down!--- Empiricism is not the only form of knowledge. Our tools of measurement are still developing. Epistemology -------There is much truth that is still elusive, keep listening and sensing.

Balance is the key.

-------

I humbly ask, if you gained any value from this letter, that you too, email me your lessons of wisdom, insight, advice, inspiration, recommendations, or anything that you feel is valuable for others to hear.  What impactful experience can you share? If I get many responses, I will create a blog, to spread our collective lessons. It might take me a while. But we are in this together, helping our collective conscious grow toward actualization. It starts with you first. 

With sincerity, may you live the greatest life you can envision.

When I got the ""you were selected"" mail I wanted to share something meaningful with all of you. I picked this quote because it helped me with some decisions in my life and I think its worth reading it twice. Last year I started my own startup called bitstars and it was not a simple decision to make. I'm 26, just finished my Master in computer science and in Germany its not that problematic to find a well payed job in this field. Additionally the startup mentality here is totally different than in the US for example and normally you get one chance to succeed. An own company is often very stressful and you have to worry about a lot of things at the same time but I still think it was absolutely the right decision. I believe in our team at bitstars and I love to work hard and if you have a great idea yourself maybe you want to leave your comfort zone as well. I wish you all good luck with your lives no matter what you do.

July 2013,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/07/19/dont-give-up-on-someone-whos-bipolar/,"July 2013, 19",don't give up on someone who's bipolar,"I wasn’t as excited as I thought I would be when I received the email from the Listserve that I had won the lottery to send out a story to thousands of people. I thought about it. I took an hour lunch break away from my cube, made a phone call and took a quick car ride around the block before I realized this was a chance to become another spokesperson in a drowned-out pool of mentally ill awareness advocates. But there can never be enough champions for the mentally ill.

I, myself, am bipolar. I was diagnosed two years ago after living with the illness since I was 19 years old. It was only when I walked onto a beige tile floor in a pair of hospital socks to a room full of doctors that I was told the diagnosis. I had a bipolar episode and was admitted to a mental unit in the city public hospital. I always knew something was wrong, and although no one wants to hear they’re bipolar, it was a relief to hear an answer to all the pain I had been dealing with.

After I was released from the hospital, I didn’t know how I would pick up the pieces to my life again. This being my fifth or sixth episode, I already knew how hard it would be. I moved out of the house I bought, into my parents’ home. My ex-girlfriend, who I put through years of hell, was gone - her and the dog. How could I blame her, someone who had to deal with someone like me - someone with bipolar - every day to not leave me after all those years of craziness? Alienating the ones you love is always those most painful part of being bipolar. The aftermath is worse.

So what exactly is bipolar? It’s different for everyone, but from my experience and what I’ve been told, it’s a mental illness that causes periods of emotional up’s and down’s, manic states – euphoric highs and an out of control state-of-mind - depressive states, uncontrollable actions, and a ton of other ill-fated effects. Coincidentally, those with bipolar have a hard time keeping jobs and relationships, among many other things. Sounds like it could ruin anyone’s life, doesn’t it?

But you learn how to manage the best you can as you go along with the right help and love. You’ll constantly have to apologize and clean up all the messes you make when you’re bipolar. I’ve done it many times since diagnosis. I’ve even lost another person that I dearly love. You’ll feel comfortable enough to decide it’s okay to stop taking your medication and/or see your doctors when you’re bipolar. I’ve also done this. Again. And you’ll go to hell and back and back again when you’re bipolar.

This is my chance to bring awareness to the mental illness that is bipolar. To bring it to light, so those that don’t know about the struggles of someone with bipolar will understand them with compassion, patience, and most importantly love. It takes a sincerely loving person to become a bipolar’s person loving martyr and partner. And they exist. I would know.

Thank you, and I’m sorry.

While we all share a basic humanity, biology would suggest that each of us is physically unique and also, most certainly, that uniqueness extends to our personalities that are the sum total of our origin, environment and experiences. It is that heterogeneous audience that makes responding to this ‘call’ so challenging but in a very good way. I congratulate my predecessors who have never failed to pique my interest and my admiration goes out to those who are seeking to change the world on some level. All of us can only hope that they never lose their passion. It may seem trite to refer to the Chinese philosopher’s words uttered more than 2,500 years ago but they remain as relevant and true today as when they were first spoken – ‘a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step.’Through the years, both from experience and observation, I have developed a modicum of knowledge that has served me well. Unfortunately, I have also learned that each generation must learn from their own experiences, no matter how much we may wish to spare them the consequences. Alternatively, it is the challenging of established doctrine that often leads to progress. I well remember, and I’m sure that many of you do also, the day when I finally realized that my parents actually knew what they were talking about. This revelation usually comes too late to avoid many pitfalls but it is also the time when the generations meld. This is my longwinded way of saying that I really do not have any momentous words to pass on that might turn out to be life altering. My only hope is that you not abandon your dreams, aspirations or goals as, after having read so many responses to the ‘call,’ I feel certain, that as a group and as individuals, you, the members of The Listserve, have much to offer.On the lighter side, there remains less than two months before the commencement of football season – a time that runs from the summer heat of Miami to the winter snows of Green Bay. From the college gridiron to the professional arena, it is the game, much to the distress of those around me, which will command much of my attention for approximately five months. I am sure that to some my enthusiasm for the game may seem irrational but I do enjoy every minute of it. Aside from several college teams for which I feel a certain allegiance, since the days of Don Hutson the Green Bay Packers have been ‘my team’ and all I can say now is “Go Pack.”One last thought. Integrity – maintain it and it will sustain you.It has been an honor to have this opportunity and I wish all of you the very best. Good luck!

July 2013,17,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/07/17/to-do/,"July 2013, 17",To Do...,"I do love a list. My current strategy is to use monthly, weekly and daily lists. These are divided into sections and follow an ever-evolving layout. For example, ‘People to Call’ was recently promoted up the page due to lack of progress in this area. A good list must keep you on your toes; get too comfortable with the format and you’ll start neglecting areas,  assuming their contents. After a leisurely peruse over the ‘Tech to Do’ section (this covers digital/online/phone-related tasks) I want to reach the bottom and then... Wham! Ah yes, we’re out of bin bags.

Lists have to be handwritten. When I think of something to add, I make a note on my phone but will write it down at the first opportunity. Otherwise, how will I cross it off? The Backspace key cannot compete with the cathartic effect of a purposeful, conclusive pen movement. But a paper list can easily be lost and the thought of trying to remember as much as possible, knowing things will be forgotten (something important?) is just horrific. So I take photos of my lists as way of digital backup and peace of mind.

My dad has always been a list-man too. Once, during a busy Sunday afternoon of him getting-things-done, my auntie turned up unannounced. Dad was briefly flustered until he’d popped over to his notepad and written something down. My auntie Hillary, having spotted this, went to have a look and was aghast to discover her brother had just given her a fifteen-minute time slot alongside the words, “Chat to Hil”.

Does this list-writing result in me getting more things done? No. But at least I can be sure of what I haven’t.

I'm not ready to address such a vast amount of people, 23,337 to be exact, but as it often happens in real life, opportunity strikes when least expected or prepared for, and who am I to cower?

The Listserve caught me at a strange point in my life: at the beginning. I'm 19 years old, just finished my first year of college, and 2 days ago, scored my first real job, as an assistant to a historian (thanks Andrea's dad!)Also, in just a few days, I celebrate my first anniversary with my boyfriend (hey Francisco!), who was also the person who told me of The Listserve.

So this is me, full of the start of it all.

Seeing that I'm writing this at the last moment, I might as well go at this stream of consciousness style (Go Holden Caulfield!)

Well, I'm currently thinking that friends are the most important thing, ever; there's college and work and family but it's friends that really make our life worthwhile; friends, and maybe children, but that's another chapter entirely.

Maybe I should give you guys some reading suggestions, if you've read this far, because I really haven't given you much reason for it, don't worry, none taken, it's coming out quite boring, I know. Well, I'm in the middle of 10,000 novels, but of the ones I've finished, there's 3 that take my heart:

The Catcher in the RyeTuesdays with MorrieL'étranger

[If you can read in the original language do it! Translations never make justice]

Hasn't this ever happened to you? You're looking at someone and you're suddenly amazed, you have to take a step back and really look at them, eyes moving, lips moving, all for you; it's as if you're amazed they're even real. Well, this happens to me a lot with you Frankie, yes you Francisco, and I thank, every time, that you are.

This past year was rough, and I'm certain that if it weren't for you, I really don't know where I would find myself today; thanks for lending me a hand through the struggle, life couldn't have given me a more perfect person to love.

Now for music! YouTube (do it do it) these full albums:Alt-J: An Awesome waveYouth Lagoon: The Year of HibernationThe Doors: The DoorsOh, and every White Stripes and Red Hot Chili Peppers album.

If you're sad, listen to ""Pale Blue eyes"" by The Velvet Underground; if you're having an odd day, ""Stephanie Says"", also by them; oh and ""These Days"" by Nico.

Take a road trip, at least once; tell me about the adventure if you'd like.

To finish, in the whole year I've received emails, I've yet to see one from my country. I'm from the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, mi patria. I must tell you: places run deeper than their waters and tourist attractions, next time, dig deeper.

It makes me infinitely sad to know I'll die & never hear so many beautiful songs, so please, email me your favorite song! I'd love to hear it, I'll pass them on to my friends, I won't be so selfish.

I'll end this uneventful email with a quote (sue me for the clichédness of it all)

My music teacher once said, ""Whenever you can, travel; you don't have to be incredibly wealthy, just incredibly curious.""

July 2013,15,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/07/15/filling-the-tanks/,"July 2013, 15",Filling the Tanks,"Ten years ago I saw “Toy Story” and vowed to work at Pixar when I was older. Now two-and-a-half colleges and a dozen internships later, I work there. Eleven years ago I stood as a bar mitzvah in front of my peers and family members, all smiley Chesire cats, only to realize that I had no idea what religion really meant to me. Now over a decade later, I’m currently in Israel meeting four cousins I’ve never met because the only truly religious experiences I've had since my bar mitzvah have taken place at the four Beyoncé concerts I've attended.

Twelve years ago I realized I was gay, or at least different enough to feel defeated when a classmate called me a faggot while playing basketball in gym class. Now I’ve been out to everyone in my life for almost three years and am learning that writing helps me channel my earlier negative anxieties into something positive.

This is all to say that I’m learning about the power of knowing your history, of being able to continually connect your present experience with the past—the now with the then. This has manifested itself in my three-week trip to Israel, during which I cried at Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial and museum, while walking on a recovered path from a concentration camp and sat with four Israeli soldiers who explained that conscription requires all Israeli citizens at the age of 18 (with a few exceptions) to enter the military. These soldiers—my youngest cousin included—are in their early twenties but feel to me to be a decade older. I listened quietly as they recounted stories of people like Eli Cohen, an Israeli spy who worked his way into Syria's political hierarchy in the 1960s until he became the Chief Adviser to the Minister of Defense, which my new Israeli friends believe allowed Israel to find success during the Six Day War. The pride in their voices was palpable. I thought about how while young Israelis are protecting their tiny country, us young twentysomethings are often lost in conversations that are mere regurgitations of things hastily read on our iGadgets en route to a job or internship (read: to the pursuit of an ever-growing career). This makes me wish I would’ve done one less internship and instead explored my family tree to learn more about my great grandparents who moved to America from Warsaw, Poland a long, long time ago.

I feel lucky to have had this time to explore my family roots. Time, that is, to “fill the tanks.” Joss Whedon, the prolific director/writer/producer, uses this phrase, and I love it. He believes in time away from routine to take in a new book, movie, or play. Or, for me, conversations with family members who live 6,000 miles away. I’ve been re-reading Peter Pan on my trip and I love the idea of Mary Darling literally tidying her children’s minds, which are confused and circular and comprised of zig zag lines. I like being open to a certain cultural messiness and taking satisfaction in being confused or surprised or both.

I won’t close with any commands or calls to action, because I don’t know the context surrounding your respective journeys. I will, however, finish by saying that I still can’t figure out how to best close an email. Regards and Best feel slightly cold, Love is often too strong, and Cheers…well I’m just not cool enough to use Cheers.

I hope that this email will serve as the beginning of a larger conversation with some of you.

First of all; thanks for all those wonderful e-mails I received from you who already won the Listserve-lottery!

And now, this is my story.

My name is Britt. When I was fourteen, my parents told me they wanted to emigrate, together with me, my little brother and sister.A year later, we moved from Holland to Sweden.It was such a big step, but after a few years living in this wonderful country, we have learned the language, have contact with a lot of lovely Swedes, feel happy in our house and are going to school and have jobs.

My mum, my dad, my brother, sister and me, we did change. In a positive way, I would say. We are more comfortable with unknown situations and like to get to know new people. I am absolutely sure that if we never had left Holland, I still would be that shy girl who I was before.

So, with this story, what I want to say to you is JUST DO IT. And yes, that's the slogan of a big sportbrand, but also a very good quote to keep in mind when you want to change your life. Or just little things in life (you have to start somewhere...).It is better to regret something you did (and have the experience of doing it) than regretting something you never did. You only get one chance!

The last thing I want to share with you are some very good artists, who need some more attention and appreciation. Listen and enjoy!

Triggerfinger (rock from Belgium)Anouk (best singer from Holland and she participated in the Eurovision Song Contest for Holland. according to me, her best album is Urban Solitude)Beth Hart (she is the best and needs more fans!)Hugh Laurie (dr. House and yes, he can sing)

Please share your story with me. At what points did you think JUST DO IT? And are you happy you did?Please visit my blog by typing ""brittalicious"" on a search engine.

Thanks so much for reading! / Tack för att du läste detta! / Bedankt voor het lezen!

I am an artist and art educator in New Jersey where I have spent nearly two decades working with high school students to develop creative and innovative thinking skills. My approach to the studio arts has been one of breaking down preconceived notions of ""art"" and ""artist"". Many of my students will enter class on the first day and announce themselves with ""My name is... and I can't draw"".  As a culture we have created some mystical idea that many teenagers adopt thinking: drawing and painting well (read: objectively) are inborn, and artistic folks are magical in some way.  Further, all other non-objective or conceptual expressions are questionable, and deserve scrutiny. 

I posit that artistic folks are magical, but not because we are naturally talented, but because we work hard at understanding and promoting creative and innovative thinking. 

Two years ago, a colleague and I started a little program in our high school as an experiment. If you follow education issues in the US you know that teachers and school programming in general is under the microscope for any number of issues that range from serious (teachers 'correcting' student standardized tests) to ludicrous (let's add more standardized tests to test kids and then evaluate teachers on those tests). My bias shows through a little, but having taught in a few vastly different districts I understand that one solution is not a fit for all problems. I digress.

The experiment: A music and art teacher will set up a small 'lab' with a handful of digital imaging, video, audio creation and production programs. We will also have available a good smattering of ""analogue"" materials as well; cables, mixers, amps, studio art supplies and so forth. For the first few years we will hand pick a dozen kids based on willingness to produce their own work in an otherwise invisible school program (no credit hours, no grades, etc). We will organize a yearly theme and open the year with seminar style presentations and discussions to launch the focus. 

As instructors, my colleague and I will not only participate in the making aspects of this with the students, but we will use this as a means to investigate the connections innovative and creative thinking have across disciplines...did I forget to mention that we weren't just choosing students who were ""artists"" or ""musicians""? 

Our pedagogy was grounded in believing that artistic thought, creative, critical, and innovative thinking are skills that transcend the studio and are of the utmost importance if we want our students to be self-directed, flexible, adaptable, and successful. Our work can easily be seen through the lens of the STEM to STEAM movement ( look up stemtosteam ) . Our kids will be ready...but how do we convince our colleagues, schools, and institutions that our thinkers, our artists are an investment for the whole of the community?  Please share your thoughts if you have experience with this!

July 2013,12,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/07/12/whats-your-passion-in-life/,"July 2013, 12",what´s your passion in life?,"Hi!

I wanna tell you about a few things that I´m passionate about. In my opinion I think it´s important for your own well being to have something to be passionate about. One of my biggest passion is is ballet (and all kind of dancing). I love to go to a good performance or show. The things I love are a bit weird. I loved the excitement in the audience, I love to see the dancers sweat (my sister have never understand that!) and see how they muscles doing all the work while they try to show the audience with there faces that this is peace of cake (which it isn´t at all!). I also love the costumes- especially the tutus in a ballet performance. I love to see a dancer do point work in their point shoes, and I know a lot of the French name of the movements, even though it´s several years since I danced myself. Ballet is so graceful and elegant and so hard to do! One of my favorite buildings in Norway (where I´m from) is the opera house. Whenever I get the change I will go to a ballet show with the Norwegian National Ballet and one of my favorite moments is right before the curtain will rise and revile the ballet dancers. Another favorite moment is when you enter the performance area and the orchestra are warming up. A lot of people think that is a mess of different sounds, but I love it! If you happens to be in Norway I strongly recommend a ballet performance of the Norwegian ballet company. Right now Ingrid Lorentzen is the ballet director and head of the ballet company and she is a perfectionist so I guess all the show is brilliant now! At least the nutcracker was!

Musical is another passion of mine. I wanted so badly to become a musical artist, but Norway is a small country so few can survive as performance artist, so I´m ending up in early childhood care instead. What I love about musicals are all the singing and dancing at once. It has always fascinated me, since I at age 7 watched the whole movie ""The sound of music"" on the television. I wished it would be social accepted to burst out in song and dance whenever, and sometimes I do that. I use that a lot with the children in the crèche or kindergarten and the absolutely love it when I sings the message instead of telling them. A very effective way of giving message cause everyone of them listen!

Photography is another thing I love to do. Unfortunate I don´t have much time to take photos anymore since I just finished a hectic study, but I will someday take photos again. And I don´t have access to a studio anymore. I loved to be in a studio and work with people. So much fun! I love to take landscape photography and portraits. In my photos I try to show how I get the feeling a person is. It´s kind of hard to explain, but I wanna show the good sides and what people is passionate about.

Another passion of mine (and I promise this is the last one) is to travel. I love to experience new cultures, new ways to live and not to forget talk English! It´s a fascinating language.

Last I will like thanks to Christina for introducing me to The Listserve.

Hope you all have a nice day!

I turn 43 next week and I’d like to go back to school, get an engineering degree, and enter the rehabilitation engineering profession.  I want put my energy into something that will make a concrete difference in the lives of others.  I’d like to use my talents to help others achieve more than they thought possible in their own lives.

Fear and my perception of the challenges seem so monumental that they've frozen any real progress for literally years.  I'm afraid of failing.  I’m afraid of succeeding and it not being what I imagined it would be.  How am I going to pay for school?  Is it smart to take out loans?  It is the right thing to do to leave a profession that I've been successful in for the last 20 years to follow a dream.  Is that the responsible thing to do?  Am I being selfish?

The truth is that I don’t know and I’m not actually sure what I’m going to do.  I’m not sharing this to tell you that I have all the answers and tell you how to live your life.  I’m not sharing this to ask for help in figuring out my life.  I’m sharing this because I believe the desire to do more with your life, to make an impact beyond yourself, is part of the human condition shared by all of us.

I share this to let you know that you are not alone.

Just as I've read the stories of others who are much older than me changing their lives, many with many more challenges then I face, allow me to at least see the possible where I fear it may be impossible, maybe you would read this and see some hope in achieving your own dreams.

Maybe together we can figure this out.

I've always loved the poem, ""If"" by Rudyard Kipling and I've thought about the words often as I've gone through my life.  I especially like the lines:

If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And---which is more---you'll be a Man, my son!

I don't know what tomorrow will bring but tonight I feel like running ... 60 seconds on the clock ... who's with me.

July 2013,10,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/07/10/constructive-summer/,"July 2013, 10",Constructive summer,"In 2009, I encountered a book that introduced me to some important ideas and shifted the way I saw the world. That book was Pulitzer-winning journalist Tracy Kidder’s biography of Dr. Paul Farmer, Mountains Beyond Mountains. Briefly, it chronicles Dr. Farmer’s experiences administering healthcare to impoverished patients in Haiti, Russia and Peru during the 90’s, but more importantly it illuminates the vast health inequities our world faced then and still faces now. It introduced to me the concepts of structural violence and the oppression of the poor, and bluntly asked me to face some very unsettling truths. For example, after administering antibiotics to an impoverished TB patient who had been suffering for months, Paul wrote, “When she received them, she soon began to respond- almost as if she had a treatable infectious disease.”  I hope that quotation makes you uncomfortable; it should. We live in a world where people die of treatable diseases because money is not allocated for their cure. How can we change that?

I can’t possibly sit here and dispense advice on solving these problems because they are immensely complex issues with roots in politics, economics, and technology. What makes the Listserve such a phenomenal project is that it offers the incomparable opportunity to connect to so many incredible, talented people with such vastly different experiences, skillsets, and worldviews. All of whom are now at my fingertips, reading the words and thoughts I think are important enough to express. No pressure. But since I’ve been given this opportunity, I’ll share a bit about where I’m coming from so that I can invite you all to think seriously about some interesting questions and hopefully let me ask for your ideas in return.

I’m a graduate student, distance runner, and aspiring mountaineer. I’ve logged serious hours in most of the national parks of the American West. I’m currently working towards my PhD studying genome instability and recombination in yeast as a model for cancer. I find my project endlessly fascinating, and am now using next-generation sequencing technology to detect individual chromosome rearrangements. Ultimately, I want to work at the intersection of science and global health, but when it comes to the arc of my career, I’m still trying to determine precisely where I want to be. Over the last few years I’ve been trying to develop a skillset that extends beyond the arena of scientific research, interning for a well-established NGO, learning a programming language, and working on the policy side of drug accessibility with an organization targeting patent agreements. I’m hoping to participate in a program that will allow me to spend time conducting clinical research in a developing country because I understand how formative such an experience would be.

Overall, I’m trying to get a grasp of the more significant needs and gaps in global health, international development, and antipoverty efforts that someone like me could fill. What applications do you see for science and genetics outside of basic research?

I’d love to hear from people in the field, people who have created their own fields, and people who are in no way related to the field but have advice on shaping a career that is challenging on a daily basis but is also truly bent on improving the human condition across the world.

For those also struggling through life's complexities, a quote from Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""Do not go where the path may lead; go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.""

I grew up in a family of muslims, catholics and atheists from four different countries. More than anything growing up in this environment made it clear how similar we all are. All of us share universal life experiences and emotions that cross cultural boundaries - we just express ourselves differently based on our own context and culture. When you grow up with so many different kinds of people you can see these behaviors and practices for the social constructs that they are.

The ""Cathedral of the World"" metaphor from Unitarian Universalist Forrest Church exemplifies it best for me:

""(1) there is one Reality or Truth (""God""); (2) this Reality shines through every ""window"" in the ""cathedral"" of the world and out from every perceiving subject; (3) it is never perceived directly; (4) yet it is reflected and refracted in a myriad of meaningful patterns on the floor of the cathedral and by every perceiver; (5) thus, every window illuminates Truth in a different way, leading to different truths.""

I love the idea of one true light simply shining through different windows, making it appear different based on where you are perceiving it. This is one of my core beliefs - I think believing in the unity of all things one way of making sense of the multicultural/ethnic experience.  Most importantly, hatred, oppression, and intolerance based on religion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or any other ""difference"" simply do not make sense when you see the world in this way.

I'm on a mission to bring this quote to life, creating a photo book that documents the various ways that different religious, spiritual and human practices reflect this light through different customs and practices.

The first practice I am looking at is the universal act of mourning after a loved one passes. I'm starting with death partly because it is universal and also because I think it's something that (at least in our western culture) we have sanitized and tend to ignore. When people are faced with death they are often woefully unprepared to manage their feelings and the experience, and I want to document the ways that different cultures and religious traditions face this part of life.

HOW DO YOU MOURN?

I want to invite you to participate in this project.

Send me a description of how you mourn. It could be a description of your cultural tradition, or a personal experience of how you mourned after the passing of a loved one. It could be an image, a poem, a tweet, a narrative description, video, song or something else entirely.

I’ll take all of the responses and use them to create a website that I'll share back with anyone who participates.

If you don’t have a story to share but would like to be notified when the project is completed, send me a note and I'll make sure to be in touch.

July 2013,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/07/08/thank-you-marissa-mayer/,"July 2013, 08","Thank you, Marissa Mayer...","In the United Kingdom we are asked to make a decision at the age of thirteen that will inform the rest of our lives. The subjects we nominate for our GCSE exams will determine our A-level choices, and then our University nominations and then our careers; which might affect where we live, our financial and social class status, the people we meet and the children we may bear. Asking a thirteen year old to make this decision is reckless. I was told to choose subjects that I was good at and I followed that advice; I studied Mathematics, Electronics and Information Technology, and then I studied Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science before starting my career as a computer programmer in London.

I lived miserably in London for four years. I never made friends, I had nights out with colleagues and partied with the people I grew up with whenever they visited; I never met anybody serendipitously. I didn’t once take advantage of the city because I was always busy working and commuting. I swapped jobs three years into my time in London and life got better, I had more free time since we didn’t have fixed working hours but then spent my time at home catching up on sleep because the nighttime noise in Camden Town tends to be filled with sirens and drunks; I’m not sure that I ever slept through an entire night whilst I lived in London.

In June 2013 I returned to the Welsh countryside, to the hills upon which I grew. I owe it to the sophomoric decision by Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer to put an end to remote working. The owner of the company for which I work had read the news when it became public in February and pronounced it as a disaster, my initial reaction was confusion since nobody at my company worked remotely, it’s because nobody had ever asked. I asked.

And now? I’m sitting in a barn and the only noise outside is that of chickens and guinea-fowl. I work remotely, the quality and quantity of my work has increased and I’m almost happy. The happiness is because I visit friends and family with frequency, it’s quiet and dark at night and I can see the stars again, everything I missed when I lived in London has returned to my life and the frustrations of my adolescent years spent in this place are no longer.

There’s just one thing. That decision I made with naivety at thirteen still haunts me. I’m a decent computer programmer and I love where I work but this isn’t really how I would like to be spending my time. Despite being a hemophobe with a tremor, I’ve decided to make the effort to go to medical school and right that wrong. Medicine is my mature decision; and until I start in September 2014 I have the quiet of the country to prepare myself. It’s what we do that counts, where we do it doesn’t matter, and a change is as good as a rest.

Things about me—no one can pronounce my last name; my hair might be red or might be blonde but it’s definitely curly; I say y’all; I have a brother and a sister, of whom I am fiercely proud.

I’m from DC, but have been working in Paris, first with an association that works with African immigrants who have HIV/AIDS. I expected to cry at that job, or to feel pleasantly selfless, but instead I realized the obvious fact that in some places, even Paris, a freckled American girl with a mostly-working knowledge of French doesn’t quite do the trick. Once a man named Jean with a velvet voice tuned for the radio held my hand and cried because he could never go home, and I couldn’t tell him in his own language that it would be okay, because I don’t speak Wolof, and because I knew it wouldn’t be.  Well, that gutted me.

Now I work with the regional center for AIDS prevention and we talk to high schoolers about prevention and kindness. In some ways, this is easier – I have a rapport with them because of my age, my skin, how society sees me. But still, I’m off to the side, I watch. Perhaps I do even less here.

I could tell you love stories about Venice and harrowing tales of falling off rocks in Arizona, but I guess for this email I just couldn’t decide which to tell. I want to live on a boat and I want to write beautifully or rawly, and I want to speak five languages but most of all I want to be brave and I want to make a difference, which is a hard thing to plan out.

If you want a 21 year old’s advice, it would be to read Eduardo Galeano’s Voices of Time, which is amazing; William Least Heat-Moon’s Blue Highways; and Arturo Perez-Reverte’s The Nautical Chart, which is a flawed book but still a lovely one.

When William Least Heat-Moon interviewed Miz Alice on Tangier Island, she said “Some people sit around and wait for the world to poke them. Right here in this old curiosity shop of a world, they say, ‘Poke me, world.’  Well, you have to keep the challenges coming. Make them up if necessary.” As my mother says, “Suck the marrow out of it.” Adventure is out there.

Please write me because I’d love that. Tell me who you are, how you live, and if you have advice for someone who hasn’t yet come up with a genius plan to fix things. If you’re in Paris, on peut prendre une verre; if you’re in DC, let’s hit up the Portrait Gallery courtyard; if you’re elsewhere, see you soon?

The world is bright and black and disappointing but I swear it is never empty.

I am Emily and I want to save the world and write about it, and I love meeting people, and like Hafiz, “I wish I could show you, when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing light of your own being.”

Thank you.

P.S. If quantum theory is correct, and there are parallel universes where all things that could have happened in our lives did happen, in at least one of them I’d be in that bright kitchen in Venice with Luca and we’d be making breakfast, and I would just like to say that I don’t know if it’s sad or wonderful that somewhere in space it’s possible that we never lose anyone at all."

I wanted to write something unique and intriguing, of course, but I’m rarely that creative. Probably tomorrow I’ll think of something fascinating I should have written. There’s a writing ‘experiment’ further in. My introduction is at the end because it is typical and boring.

Try sunflower butter with honey on rye toast.

I intended the bulk of this e-mail to be about Tolkien and YouTube (as two separate topics, though now I wonder if there are any good Tolkien-focused YouTube channels?), but I really don’t know what to say about Tolkien other than I am utterly fascinated and enamoured with his creation of Middle-Earth and all that relates to it (I’m going to Oxford at the end of August as a kind of pilgrimage). I have a bit more to say about YouTube.

I’m always fascinated when people don’t understand YouTube in the same way I do – thinking it’s just for how to guides, silly clips or music videos. I wonder how many of you understand YouTube in this way? I hope you’d be impressed by amount of original quality content created for YouTube by ordinary people, and the communities that grow around that content. I would love for more people to experience this world. Hard to describe with words, just check out some YouTubers instead – for ‘beginners’ I recommend kickthepj and charlieissocoollike. For something a little different, check out hexachordal. (Yes, they’re all popular British male YouTubers but off the top of my head I think they’re a good start). There’s a fantastic series running now called Becoming YouTube; I’m not sure how interesting it would be for someone who’s not already engaged with YouTube but you could check it out.

You’ll get no sage life advice or wisdom garnered through travelling from me, but here are some lyrics to keep in mind (“Show Starts Now” by Cloud Cult; Craig’s words help keep things in perspective):

I love basketball, but we'll come back to that. Went to college hoping to become a doctor, didn't quite work out. Didn't feel so great about myself for letting my parents down. Met some great people. Some not so great. Both groups were equally important to me. Met this girl, but that ended up like my med school dreams, just slowly drifted away. Missed my little brother a ton, made sure to keep checking up on him. I've always raised him like a son, and he's always seen me as a cool older brother - so it works out for both of us. Decided I'll be joining the Navy Hospital Corps in a year, I'm pretty damn excited about that. I think that sums it up pretty well.

So basketball... it's always been my sanctuary. I've been playing since age 4. I love everything about the sport. I can watch it anywhere, anytime, no matter who's playing. Right now I'm coaching a group of middle school  children(~age 12-15) and it's one of the best experiences of my life. They grew up in a tough neighborhood in New York City, so this is a good influence for them. I see myself in them sometimes, because I know they're escaping something to come play this beautiful game.

If there's anything I learned from all these different emotions it's that there is not a better feeling in the world than to make others truly happy. To me, it's selfish for me to be upset about not going to med school, or not getting the girl, because I am incredibly blessed and lucky to be where I am today. Whether it's when I'm at the nursing home playing bingo with the residents, or refereeing a Special Olympics Soccer Qualifier - putting a smile on another human's face is the best feeling in the world.

So here's what I want to do, if you're still with me up to this point. I want to go to India and start a foundation that gives the opportunity and resources to underprivileged children in order for them to become basketball players. This doesn't necessarily mean pros in the NBA, but just turning them into happy, HEALTHY athletes is enough for me. I don't care how much money they have, because I won't take a penny from them. I don't care how little they know about basketball, because that's what the coaches will be there for. I want to help them achieve their goals through basketball, even if becoming a professional basketball player isn't the final goal. Think of it as a launching pad for their dreams - of sorts. I'll be waiting for a reply from you with your advice or how you can help me out. I am a single person with a big dream and I need your help to put a smile on these kids' faces. Let's make it happen. Please.

Recently, I decided that I would no longer make excuses for myself. I would begin to hold myself accountable, but still honor what I was feeling. I would exercise more, eat locally, make new friends, enjoy my job, and quit letting external factors determine what my next excuse would be. I would now hold the key to my destiny, as it is not predetermined by anyone besides myself. 

Since the day I eliminated all excuses, I have finished my first triathlon and will be doing two more this summer. I have lost 25 pounds. I have opened myself up to new friendships. I am a better person, partner, friend, and companion not only to others, but also to myself. And I feel great! 

I have learned that you truly must love yourself first, inside and out. I have learned that if your outside doesn't match your inside (or vice versa) you have the means within YOU to change it. No excuse will help you get better, only time, dedication, and willingness to CHANGE. 

So, today I encourage each of you to consider not making excuses for one day. When your mind thinks, I'm going to skip out on ____, realize that's an excuse and do it anyway. 

Try it for one day, and send me an email to let me know how it went. We are all on this life journey together. We might as well have some fun with it.  Challenge yourself. Be bold. Laugh often. After all, life is good :)

Fireworks are truly a cross cultural, worldwide phenomenon. Pyrotechnics as we know them today date back all the way to ancient China where they were used to ward off evil spirits. Today however, they are used as a way to celebrate things and events around the world, whether it be a national holiday, religious celebration, or the beginning of a new year.

But I'm not here to dwell on the fantastic, awe inspiring beauty, and downright awesomeness that IS the modern day firework. No, rather to draw your attention to the work that goes on behind the scenes, where hardworking men and women come together to put on a spectacular show, literally risking their health and well being doing something that they love.

Planning for a show (in the U.S.A. at least) typically begins months in advance with client meetings and gathering of permits. Shows can be specifically choreographed to music if the customer so desires. Costs easily run into the tens of thousands of dollars for a show you might see in your hometown on the 4th of July; basically the more rapidly shells are being launched into the dark night sky, the more money it costs.

The day of the show, work beings bright and early with equipment being loaded onto a truck and driven to the show site (usually a big open field with little shade and no bathrooms) where it is quickly unpacked. The ""Head Pyro"" uses a set of printed plans to determine where certain sized shells will be launched from on the field. Fireworks are launched from a tube which is secured inside a wooden rack. Picture what a military mortar might looks like, except 5 to 8 attached side by side pointed vertically. Each wooden rack weighs 20 to 30 lbs (or at least they feel that heavy after a long hot day outside). Wooden cross braces are nailed to each rack to prevent them from tipping over. This process, including loading the actual fireworks into the tube takes the better part of the day.

Excitement and anxiety builds as showtime nears. The whole crew makes final checks of the tubes, lining up fuses, and checking the stability of racks using only the light from a headlamp or flashlight. Two minutes before the show begins road flares attached to long metal handles, which are used to light the fuses, are ignited, their red glow illuminating both the field and the crew who are dressed head to toe in protective gear. Everyone is ready and more or less silent - eagerly anticipating the go ahead to shoot. Patriotic music builds up in the distance as the call finally comes in...""FIRE!"" The first shells leave the tubes with a deafening report, a bright flash, and a cloud of white smoke. The show finishes 15 minutes later with special 'smiley face' shaped fireworks as the crowd in the stadium goes absolutely wild. For me that's what it's all about - complete strangers cheering for the show and our hard work.

Trucks are repacked and everyone departs the show site anywhere from 11pm to 3am depending on size and cleanup. It's been a long day, but completely worth every minute.

I welcome all feedback, questions, and comments. Nice or mean I'll read them and respond.

I should clarify that my baby is not a human baby, but rather a company that I own. Right now, my baby is called Fresh Prints. We make custom-design apparel. I’m a senior in college, and all 40 people that I work with are also college students. I’ve spent my entire college career living and breathing this company. Unfortunately, for complicated trademark reasons, multiple lawyers have told us that we need to change our company name.

The past year has shown me that the Listserve community is filled with smart, funny and diverse people. I can’t imagine a better group of people to rely on when I need to make such an important decision. So, I’m asking for your help in 2 ways:

1) Send me ideas for a new name! We want a name that is clever, easy to pronounce and indicates what we do. Here's what you need to know about us: we're all college students, our top-notch graphic designers provide clients with free professional designs and we will do anything for our customers. We make ordering custom apparel really, really easy. We make really awesome t-shirts, hoodies, aprons, pretty much anything!

I’ll post the suggestions we get on our facebook page for everyone to comment on. (just search Fresh Prints on Facebook).

2) Use [insert new company name] to make awesome clothing! I love working with people to make awesome apparel and I'd love to meet fellow listervers, so if you ever ever want some custom apparel, send me an email! Mention that you're from the listserve so I can personally give you some special treatment and a discount :)

My last request is that you help grow the listserve. When I joined over a year ago, there were ~21,000 people, and we’re only at 23,000 now. If we all get three or four friends to join, there’s no reason we can’t pass 100,000 people in the next two weeks.

P.S. If you like technology, laughing or cleverness, follow my friend Aaron Wilson on Twitter (@aarowilso)

P.P.S. One of my more cynical friends suggested that I make the subject line on this email “You’ve won the Listserve.” Because that’s one of the crueler things I can think of, I hope I just ruined that joke for any future, heartless listserver :)

July 2013,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/07/01/human-nature/,"July 2013, 01",Human Nature,"I teach.  My fellow teachers would probably describe me as calm, patient, positive, and disorganized. I genuinely love my job and I enjoy working with students and helping them learn, grow, and succeed. I have a knack for connecting with some of the toughest students to connect with and I pride myself on not judging my students and repeating the mantra of one of my professors from college—hate the problem, love the student. I am always willing to give my time and effort to help a student, fellow staff member, or friend.

I also, fundamentally, feel that humans are naturally selfish. We are incredibly self-interested. I don’t believe true altruism exists.

I do believe, however, that selfishness and wickedness are not linked. Rather, I believe that all humans can be taught to be, as I like to call it, selfishly selfless.

I love my job because it makes me feel valued. I enjoy seeing my students succeed. It brings me pleasure to lead a life of meaning. I am unbelievably selfish. I do what I do because it makes me feel good.

Rather than choosing to fulfill my own selfish desires by personal success and a cutthroat attitude, I choose to find that happiness by helping others. I actively make this choice every morning when I wake up. I’m not perfect—I’m human—I slip up. I have days where I do things I regret. I also wasn’t always like this—I actively made a choice to be this way.

How we treat others, how we move through life—that is a choice. We cannot change our nature but we can change how we engage with it.

I urge you to choose to be selfishly selfless. Choose to be kind to everyone you meet, in the hopes that they will do the same. Choose to advance yourself by making the world a better place for those around you. Choose to create a world that would best suit you by exemplifying what you wish others would be.

You may find yourself happier. You may also find yourself getting more of the things you want.

Have a fantastic day,

June 2013,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/06/29/disneyland/,"June 2013, 29",Disneyland!,"Hi everyone. One of my goals in life is to go to all the Disneylands. I'm not really sure why, because i'm not a big Disney fanatic. But I guess I did grow up watching Disney movies when I was younger, so it's probably subconsciously brainwashed me. I think the appeal for me is how Disneyland brings out the kid in you, irregardless of what age you are.

The first time I went to Disneyland was in America when I was 5, and it was my first trip overseas. Going to Disneyland is probably the greatest thing that could happen to a 5 year old. For whatever reason, I have a vivid memory of being in Mickey's house and seeing his clothes in the washing machine, thinking he was trapped inside. Obviously, I was a stupid 5 year old.

My second Disneyland experience was in Hong Kong at 15 years old, and most recently, 20 years old in Paris. Even at 20, I found myself running around the park with my (older) sister trying to find Mickey to get a photo. My favourite ride would have to be the laser shooting Buzz Lightyear one. I'm not sure if my laser gun was faulty, or if I was just really good at that game, but I managed to get over 37,000 points - whereas everyone else around me were sitting at around 5000 tops. I like to think the latter. (And to my lovely sister, I'm still laughing at your inferior 2,900 points, ha!)

I still haven't had a chance to visit Japan... so that is definitely next on the list, and it can hopefully be ticked off in the next year or so.

Re-reading this feels kind of silly because it's such a trivial goal to have, but I guess to put it in perspective for myself - in going to all the Disneylands, it encourages me to keep travelling and seeing more of the world. And, I really do love that Buzz Lightyear game.

Thanks for letting me share this silly insight into myself! And hope you're having a lovely day/night wherever you are!

June 2013,28,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/06/28/seize-the-septum-ring/,"June 2013, 28",Seize the Septum Ring,"First of all, to all of you past Listserve writers, thank you for sharing.  I’ve read each one from top to bottom.  Whether strictly informational or a vent of something that’s been bottled up too long or something else entirely, each Listserve email is, in itself, an insight into how various people choose to use a loudspeaker moment.  I didn’t join in the hopes of having that moment; I joined to see what others would do with theirs.  Yet now I’ve been caught in the spotlight, and who am I to chicken out?

Many Listservers have shared their own rules, mottos, inspirational messages, etc. on how to get going with life: Carpe Diem, one foot in front of the other, don’t fear failure, put yourself out there, learn something new, etc.  I don’t want to pooh-pooh any of that, but much of it is easier said than done.  Fear of failure can be pretty darned ingrained in people.  And how does one seize a day?  Does it have horns or a septum ring one can latch on to?

Motivational speeches, slogans, and pep talks are great if they happen to apply to you and your unique situation at that particular point in your life.  They can get us jacked up and excited, which is usually good.  But without anything tangible to put that jacked-up excitement into, the Jack who’s popped from the box goes limp and the music stops.  (Yes, I know there’s a that’s-what-she-said joke in there somewhere.)

So what should come next?  Well, I hate to present a problem without a possible solution, so I’ll share what I think.  First, slow down, hot shot.  Don’t go sprinting off whatever couch you’ve been sitting on and seize the first septum ring you see, thinking it’s attached to a diem.  What you’re looking to do is apprentice from someone else who is more advanced than you.  I’m not talking about any Donald Trump crap; think Ben Franklin.  This works for virtually everything and can give you tangible tasks toward reasonable goals.  To be a good apprentice, you need three things: someone who is a good teacher of beginner-level and novice work, a master-level practitioner whose techniques you can dissect and model, and someone who will watch you closely and keep you accountable.  If you’re lucky, you’ll find all three in one person.  If not, make due; you’ll be fine.

But it does mean asking for help, which is often the hardest part.

Want to be a writer?  Read your favorite author over and over and over, dissecting what he or she is doing, take some classes, and join/create a writer’s group.  Want to be happier?  Search out someone truly, consistently happy (not just delusional), and tell someone who cares about you that you’re not happy.  They’ll help.  Get the idea?  I want to be a great father for my kids, but, as much as I love my own, I apprentice from my childless uncle who actually got down on the floor and played silly games with us when we were kids.

And, for the love of whatever God/gods you believe in, if you ever see someone struggling, help.  Whether it’s a hug or teaching the ways of the printing press, the human race advances only through the sharing of kindness and experience.

But before I reach my word limit, watch Bill Murray’s “Razor’s Edge.”  Listen to Buckethead’s “Monsters and Robots” and R.L. Burnside’s “A Ass Pocket of Whiskey.”

That’s it for me. Thanks.

The core of the electromagneticism is the probably pretty easily identified, but even within the voltage there are groups that seem to serve electric functions

you have a group that sort of acts as the services, they roam from thread to thread, dogpile, triangulating little attacks on people. They're a pretty small group and they do tend to electrify in a pack. Usually once they start dogpiling they draw in other random people who also want to join in. There are a couple of these that are really charged, often offering basically mechanical posts that consist of nothing more than one line pokes and jabs as electric, or little more than incredibly repetitive almost canned responses. Often times they seem to attempt to couch everything they say in a layer of sarcasm and ""ignition"". They usually do a lot of back patting and self congratulating with each other back at the don't steal my electric thread. 

Then you have a group that really just consists of sparks who are friends of the bullies, but don't generally join in on the bullying because they're pretty much just interested in talking to each other and occasionally they'll engage someone outside of their social circle, but mostly they stick close. They tend to defend the bully group and inflame their actions as either joking or defensible because the target(s) of the attack were being ""energized matter"" or acting inappropriately. Some of them just tend to stop posting when the juice comes up and simply come back later continuing as if nothing happened because they don't want to be involved in the voltage, but they certainly don't want to call out their friends.

June 2013,25,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/06/25/change-is-awesome/,"June 2013, 25",Change is Awesome!,"Hello ListServe community!

So EXACTLY a year ago from today my close friend & home girl Layla (Hii Lovely!) forwarded me a ListServe email titled Random Beauty (by Ishita in Kolkata, India, hello to you as well J ). It is such beautiful synchronicity that now, literally to the day, I just won the chance to write to you all! I’ve thought about this day happening since I signed up, but I also believed that something amazing would be in the process of occurring when this lucky moment aligns with my life...  And I’m sitting here laughing to myself because this is probably the first time in my life that I have absolutely nothing concrete/academic or otherwise happening. Well played universe, well played... It’s quite unsettling for me, realizing this and not knowing when things will change, but at the same time knowing they will. Ever get the feeling of knowing something without knowing anything at all?

I know many people avoid changing, and it’s a shame because change is beautiful if you let it be. About 3 years ago I moved to New York City to pursue a graduate degree in Counseling Psychology at Columbia University, but what I have gained in the process of my education is an evolution of my entire self.  Young, naïve, hopeful and afraid, I eagerly ventured out of my hometown in Houston, TX (what up, Htown!)… I wanted more, to know more, to experience more, and do more. And I still do.  As a counselor, I get to help people re-shift, refocus, and empower their life into a more meaningful experience, but to me, the most special part of that is the relationships I build with people; just connecting with someone. Currently, I’m at a very in between place, or rather in transition I should say. I just graduated with a double Masters (I know, overachiever much…), and finished an amazing yearlong internship as a Family/Couples/Individual Counselor, so what’s next? I can’t wait to find out! Potential employers do feel free to contact me (or look me up on Linkedin) J

So coming full circle now, in the initial ListServe email I was forwarded, I learned about a Japanese phrase, Koi No Yokan.  Ishita, you described it as “The feeling you can get when meeting a person for the first time, that you will fall in love with them. Different from ""love at first sight"", as it does not say that love already exists, only the knowledge that it WILL happen later.”To me this perfectly describes my relationship with NYC, I didn’t know then that I would fall so deeply in love with this city, but I felt it immediately <3

---------------------------------------""When we make a change, it's so easy to interpret our unsettledness as unhappiness, and our unhappiness as the result of having made the wrong decision. Our mental and emotional states fluctuate madly when we make big changes in our lives, and some days we could tight-rope across Manhattan, and other days we are too weary to clean our teeth. This is normal. This is natural. This is change.""-- Jeanette Winterson-----------------------------------------

Also, just wanted to send a special hello out there to my Girls (Fizz, Fatimah, Lay, Elvy, Chirstie; love ya ladies), my immediate and extended family (Hey hey… Muneel/Mustufa y’all are probably the only ones that read this...), my soul-mate (somewhere out there; you can show up now), and Justin Timberlake (for obvious reasons, hehe).

And much love to you all over the world! Be brilliant! <3

June 2013,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/06/24/tooting-your-own-horn/,"June 2013, 24",Tooting Your Own Horn,"One of the guidelines for posting here is that you can’t write anything too self-promotional. I suspect most of us struggle with figuring out when exactly it’s right to toot our own horns. Nobody wants to be that guy or girl: the shameless self-publicist, the human spambot. And yet, sometimes we do create great work that we’d like others to know about – what then? How do we decide when our work is good enough, important enough, to warrant puffing up our chests and shouting about it?

I’ve been working on a creative project with a small team for over a year now, and a few months ago we stepped back and realised we were done. It wasn’t perfect, but we knew we couldn’t hold off much longer: it was time to launch it into the world.

We immediately found ourselves stuck, with no idea how to get the word out without feeling silly or boastful. We’re all introverts and prone to self-deprecation. We’re not used to saying, “Hey, everyone, look over here! What we’ve done is pretty amazing!” We could see flaws in our work and could see where it was lacking. We were acutely aware that our project wasn’t going to save lives or leave anybody slack-jawed in wonderment. So we decided to postpone the launch and keep tweaking. Tweaking was easier. Less scary.

In a similar vein, a friend of mine has been working on his novel for years. Every six months or so, he’ll retrieve it from inside a deeply-nested folder on his hard drive and spend the next two months re-drafting it. When he’s done, he’ll leave it for six months and redraft it again. I suspect he feels uncomfortable taking the next step and pitching it to a publisher because there’s already so much great writing out there, and he’s wary of appearing arrogant.

My guess is that there are a lot of us out there: those that maybe should be talking our work up more, should be properly launching the projects we’ve worked hard on, and should be more comfortable marketing the stuff we’ve created. It’s a shame that, in some cases, those who are most comfortable with self-marketing are those without anything interesting to promote in the first place. Meanwhile, some of the greatest living artists and thinkers are right now almost certainly working in obscurity, lacking the confidence or the platform to show the world what they’re doing.

For those of us that aren’t prone to shouting about ourselves, we risk being drowned out by those that can and do. The presumption is that if you don’t say anything, you don’t have anything to say, but it doesn’t necessarily work that way. Those that are quiet are sometimes just waiting for a gap in the conversation. They’re waiting to be invited to speak.

With all this said, I’ve got a tiny little speck of an idea. I’d love to hear what you guys have created or are working on – especially those of you who aren’t usually comfortable promoting your work. If you send me a short paragraph about a creative project you’re working on, I’ll compile them on my blog (same domain as my email address) for all of you other Listservers to take a peek at.

We need more opportunities for the quieter amongst us – those less prone to chest-puffery – to tell the world about ourselves, our achievements, our stories, and our insights. I’m glad that the Listserve exists for exactly that reason.

You guys are all wonderful, by the way.

I always tend to be most interested in the ones that share the writer’s passion, so I am going to go ahead with mine.

I just moved to Chicago a month ago to study Social Entrepreneurship. I am fascinated with the idea that a business can truly be good for everyone. From the consumer, to the business owner, to every worker and even help the environment and others not directly connected. I believe if all businesses can function like this, we can solve a lot of our problems. Think about it, if everyone wins, why aren’t we doing it? Unfortunately, there are very few businesses that function this way, and none on a large scale.

This is where we can make a difference. I moved to get my Masters while studying Social Entrepreneurship at DePaul University. While I do so, I also am working at a fairly new clothing company, Trunk Club. Trunk Club is completely changing how men’s clothing is sold. This, along with my classes, will help me to achieve this dream.

Trunk Club is a great resource that helps men who hate shopping, don’t have time to shop, or just want some help dressing better. It is completely different from normal clothing stores, in that they send you a trunk customized to your wants and needs, you pick what you like, and send back the rest. You only keep what you like, and are only charged for that. It’s been great so far and I’ve already learned a lot. I can’t wait to learn more at this fast growing business.

In order to keep this job however, I need to pass my initial trial. It has proved difficult, even with my 12-14 hour workdays this first month. If every person in the United States on here buys anything from Trunk Club through me, that part is a MUST, then I will make my sales goal. If I do this, it will help me get closer to my dream of changing what we think of when we think of “business.” This is exactly where I need to work to learn more about the field. I think if we make these changes with business, we can change the world. Please email me if you would be interested in checking it out and helping at all, either you checking out a trunk or stopping by if you live in/near Chicago, even if you only buy a pair of socks, or if you know of anyone that would be interested. I really appreciate any and all help.

By the way this whole winning The Listserve Lotto today is pretty amazing. My trial at Trunk Club ends at the end of June. I was starting to get scared that I would not make it, that I was going to have to find something else, and then I received the “you won” email.

With all of this, I want to say thank you to everyone that can help, you do not understand how much I appreciate anything and everything. This does not only mean those that can help with money, I want to thank everyone who has inspired me so often through these emails.  Also, I have to thank my girlfriend for fully encouraging me to move 4 hours away to pursue my dream, I love you.

Arrested Development, Season 1 Pilot__________________________________________

Think of an explorer. Where did they go? Why did they go there? What did they find? What did they inspire? Exploration extends beyond imagination, to where no man (or woman) has gone before. From the highest peaks, to the limitless depths of the Amazon, to the troughs of the grandest oceans, explorers put themselves on the line. They take passionate risks.

Think of an entrepreneur. What did they build? Why did they build it? What problem are they solving? How did they change the world? Entrepreneurs solve real problems with innovative solutions. Whether for consumers, businesses, or both, entrepreneurs identify the unknown and attempt to solve problems like never before. Risking their livelihood, entrepreneurs put themselves on the line. They take passionate risks.

Through my employment at Tigerlabs, I have the good fortune to invest in and work alongside brilliant risk takers tackling real problems, modern explorers if you will. Whether they are incentivizing healthy behavior (LifeVest Health), making it easier for scientists to communicate, collaborate, and solve the great disease mysteries of our time (PLOM), or making real time discussion and collaboration possible (Wisdomly), these entrepreneurs are solving the problems they see in the world. There is nothing more inspiring than having the opportunity to sit side-by-side with real explorers.

Though Arrested Development might very well make fun of the notion of a cartographer (sorry, Buster), the mapping of unchartered territories extends beyond geography. For an entrepreneur, the unchartered is the limits of their ability to design, build, and execute. Core to their ability is the power to iterate, to recognize their mistakes and do better, to look failure in its face and dig deeper.

The notion of the entrepreneur as the modern explorer extends beyond the physical. Entrepreneurial risk explores how far we are willing to take ourselves beyond the known world. What greater exploration could we ever ask for?

Ready. Set. Go.

You probably don't know much about us now, but you probably will during the next World Cup. I was unsure what to write about, until I saw, last night, June 13, 2013, all hell break loose in the city of São Paulo. It started as a protest against raising bus taxes - described in an apologetic way by politicians as 'under inflation margin', as if they had nothing to do with that. But after 3 days of protest, it became much more than that. It was a protest against the government priorities, and how the people still go hungry while over-budgeted, unfinished World Cup construction sites that have become an excuse to steal the people's money - I mean literally steal.

And the protesters said that. In signs, on the internet, in interviews. The peaceful protest was met with an unjustified attack of tear gas and rubber bullets. And it made me cringe to watch what was happening live, while listening to the reporters saying that the opposite was going on. People had been arrested before manifestations started - for possession of vinegar. Vinegar is used to minimize effects from tear gas. Which means people were being arrested for trying to protect themselves against the police. Did they expect them to receive the violence with open arms? The manifestation became then, also for the right of speaking out against the government, and against unnecessary violent police repression. It was a protest for our right to protest.

The manifestation was violently disrupted. Police closed entire streets with the excuse that they didn't want the protest to close streets (?) and then called themselves successful for reopening such streets. Legislation is being made to qualify public manifestations such as this as terrorism (PL 728/2011) and in my city, public manifestations were FORBIDDEN during the international soccer championships. A civil right, forbidden, in order to make us look good. For you.

Now this might seem to you like a horrible isolated event. It's not. It's commonplace, really. Our police military forces are a leftover organization from the dictatorial far right military government that took over our country from 1964 to 1985. For 21 years, we were stripped of all individual rights, silently tortured and killed, and forced to live in fear. And considering public manifestations of citizens as terrorism was one of their excuses for it.

So I'm writing because you need to know, that if you see a peaceful country during the World Cup, you are being lied to. Governors will state that things like the recent rape of an American tourist is rare, when it is actually epidemic and rising. Two Brazilian women had already been raped by the same gang and the police did nothing. They would have stayed that way if they hadn't made the horrible mistake of raping a foreign woman.

We are angry, but also afraid. How to fight against this? And the answer is: You. The one thing our government fears is to look bad in front of international entrepreneurs and investors.  So search for this online. Find our videos and statements. Spread it out. Put our real reasons for protesting in the news. Help us achieve our right to protest, our right to speak out against oppression, the right to live without fear of the government.  We have an unique opportunity to make ourselves visible to the whole world, during the World Cup of 2014. Make it count.

June 2013,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/06/18/they-throw-everything-at-him/,"June 2013, 18","""They throw everything at Him""","A friend asked me for some advice on a script she was developing about a professional wrestler. She wasn't interested in the ""hows"" of professional wrestling, such as ""how does one become a wrestler"" or ""what is the thought process when creating the unusual art that is professional wrestling. Her line of questioning focused more on ""who becomes a wrestler"" and more importantly ""why does a person become a wrestler?""

Clearly that answer is unique to each individual involved and as you can imagine everyone in our industry is a bit of an odd bird. I sometimes joke that the people in wrestling range from the unique to the mentally ill. Though involvement may sometimes be for the wrong reasons almost all of us do it because we simply feel like we have to. 

There is a unique experience that comes from professional wrestling that is found in no other art form that I know. There is the ballet-like expression of human emotion through physical movement, there is improvisation interwoven through conspired melodies like jazz. But to combine them into one form with a beautiful, sometimes malevolent, intention of manipulating people into states of cathartic fury is unlike any other I've seen. 

Though she had seen the film already I advised her to watch Darren Aranofsky's ""The Wrestler."" Though it does illustrate a darker side of professional wrestling, the side of drugs and damaged relationships, it also shows the kind of personality that thrives in that business. Due to it's numerous allusions to the Jesus story I sometimes call the film ""The Passion of the Ram."" Randy ""The Ram's"" side is pierced in his match against Necro Butcher, he has a messianic pathology that leads him to sacrifice everything for theenjoyment of his fans, and eschewed by society and scourged in the ring. A direct comparison is even made by the character Cassidy who quotes the Bible by way of the film ""The Passion of the Christ"":

		    ""He was pierced for our                    transgressions, He was crushed for                    our iniquities. The punishment that                    brought us peace was upon Him, and                    by His wounds we were healed.""

It is as if the sacrificial lamb has reached full adulthood and has become The Ram. I know that my involvement in wrestling makes me predisposed to enjoying this film but I'd advise you to look up Penn Jillette's ""Penn Points"" in which he reviews this movie. He is an artist with whom I have great admiration and I think his time as a performer gives him a special understanding of the picture.

I've heard many criticisms of our ""sport"" and consider myself an ambassador for our business. My character, my ""gimmick"" if you will, is ""The Voice of Reason"" because it is a reflection of who I am in real life. I do not believe in supernatural powers and am an advocate for science and skepticism. I do not use drugs or alcohol because, as a human, I am already driven by enough irrational thinking and I feel that as person of some minor influence (particularly to children) that I should demonstrate that toughness is more than just physical.

June 2013,17,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/06/17/one-motorcycle-trip/,"June 2013, 17",One motorcycle trip,"In 2010, I & some friends decided to go to Leh in the Himalayas on our motorcycles. We had been planning for months. 2 of us had even quit our jobs just for this. Disaster struck the day before departure- Leh and all roads leading there were struck by flash floods and heavy landslides killing and stranding hundreds of people in that region. We were still in Delhi, still about 400 miles to anywhere close to it.

If we had left even two days before, we could have been trapped or killed but it felt like we were given another opportunity to carry on our adventure. And so we did. That night we decided to go to the neighboring Himalayan region of Lahaul-Spiti, an area we had no idea about since all our planning was for Leh. All we had now was a map in our hands.

Our motorcycles were  small single-cylinder engines. We were carrying only the basics for supplies and spares. We weren't really prepared for rain but luck was on our side and we had beautiful weather throughout- 2 days of rain out of 14 isn't bad! We just followed one road and it turned out to be the two best weeks of my life, yet.

My only advice to anyone — ride a motorcycle. Not because you can go fast or because it looks “cool”. But mainly because it can teach you many things and give a new perspective towards life. That trip taught us several things. It taught some to relax and not aim to see everything possible. It taught responsibility by showing effects of alcohol on AMS. It taught us perseverance in the face of deep-water crossings and quicksand-like mud. It taught us to celebrate every obstacle and beautiful view that we came across. It taught us to stop and smell the roses (we’d stay a day longer if we liked a place). It taught us to be best friends even when we barely knew each other. It taught us to enjoy the simple pleasures of life- like a hearty breakfast or a glimpse of vegetation! Most importantly, it kept us grounded. We were not keeping score, racing against time, marking points on a map, trying to make deadlines or writing magazine articles- just riding because we were enjoying it. If there has been a time I've felt really ‘free’, that was it.

So ride a motorcycle- every day if you can. It’s a humbling but fun experience once you get over your fears. Over the years motorcycling has taught me to find peace in the chaos of a city without escaping it, to keep doing only things that I love doing and most importantly, to stay real and true to myself. For instance, I have been doing more non-profit work as a graphic designer- because I got tired of brands misleading people giving them a false sense of self-worth. I have even moved across the world to be with the woman I love. Motorcycling has inspired my life in various other ways that’s impossible to list here.

Like riding, Listserve proves that to be “wise” and “philosophical”, one doesn't need to be a spiritual guru or have learned meditation techniques or read millions of books. All it takes is their unique life experiences that everyone can learn from. The naysayers just need to appreciate themselves a bit more.

Thank you Listserve and everyone for reading and sharing your stories and beliefs. You are welcome to visit my website (anuranjan-dot-com) to know me, my work, the trip or if you want to simply connect for good food or go riding in NYC!

June 2013,15,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/06/15/how-to-deal-with-curly-hair/,"June 2013, 15",How to deal with curly hair,"Listen up. If you have curly hair, or a kid with curly hair, there are some things you need to know.

I'm going to share 3 cardinal rules, a washing/styling process that works without fail, and tips on how to straighten (not that you'd want to after you learn how to flaunt your curls).

Cardinal rules-------------------------------------------------1. Never comb, brush, or run your fingers through dry curls.2. Do not let curls air dry even for 1 minute without product in.3. If you can, wash your hair every other day, not everyday.

Washing/styling process -------------------------------------------------1. Wet hair thoroughly, apply shampoo and rinse. Repeat if necessary.

2. Apply one coat of conditioner and comb through/remove tangles WHILE IN THE SHOWER UNDER RUNNING WATER with a broad toothed comb. Rinse conditioner.

3. Add another coat of conditioner. Twist your hair up in a bun and secure with a clip. Do the rest of your shower routine without rinsing and or getting your hair under the water.

4. Remove the clip and rinse conditioner off (almost completely) at the very end of your shower.

5. Wrap your hair up in a towel without rubbing the towel on your head at all. Just let the towel absorb the water.

6. After at least 3 minutes but no more than 5 minutes, remove the towel and gently squeeze the excess water off. Again, no rubbing or shaking. Your hair has to be substantially wet, so just squeeze enough so that it stops dripping but is still wet.

7. Apply LIBERAL AMOUNTS of product. I use Sedal Rizos Obedientes and it is the best product ever. Put about a plastic Coke bottle cap amount on your hand and use your fingers to disperse it through the entire length of your hair. Repeat this 3 times if your hair is still moderately wet, and 4 times if you let it dry too much (you can tell if it's too dry if you see individual hairs separating from the curls). This is the last time you will run your fingers through your hair until you wash it again.

8. Let hair air dry. Try not to move your head around too much or be stuck in the wind, this will undo the curls before they even form.

9. After about 2-3 hours when your hair has dried, flip your head over and carefully run your palms along the entire surface. NO FINGERS. This creates volume and removes the sometimes sticky product leftovers.  Results: kibilds @ instagram, look for a pic taken on 4 September 2012.

Straightening--------------------------------------------Not getting into too much detail here. Just know that if you want it to stay straight for more than 1 hour, you need to blow it out with a round brush completely AND also flat iron it completely. If you only do one of these things, you will either have a) frizzy hair that looks dry or b) burnt hair that looks sorry.

Enjoy your curls ladies and gents!

Her advice was: “They’re strangers.  It doesn’t matter what they think.” I thought that was a good point for about an hour before I realized she was wrong.

There’s a difference between your opinion mattering and me letting it change how I express myself, in any way.

Thoughts have intrinsic value.  They are untarnished by Likes or Retweets. They float through the miasma of the universe, or wherever thoughts go.

It DOES matter what you think, even if it doesn't (necessarily) matter to ME.

Not only does it matter, it’s the MOST IMPORTANT THING.

Vishnu Schist matters to the boatman at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.  He thinks the rock is God’s flesh, practically.

Poles matter to the blind skier.  He thinks: “I’m already blind and skiing; for Christ’s sake, help me out with some poles!”

Pickled or fresh?  The type of jalapeño I prefer on my Prawn Deluxe burrito matters to the burrito-rolling man.

It all matters.

WE all do.__

My biggest fear is not reaching my full potential.  Not mining every morsel of me.  If my dreams are too small I’ll limit myself.  Fear, false hope, and expectations will creep in and block my path to self-actualization.  But if my dreams are planet-sized, orbiting through an infinitude of lost thoughts, at least I’ll get to find out.  A goldfish grows to fit its bowl.  Pardon me--to fit its tank.

My thoughts guide me on a tour of the Quantum field, a New-Age-Neverland, Shangri-La, McDonald’s-When-You’re-Seven-Years-Old kind of field.  I’ll stay here, I think I will, cultivating excellence, spreading joy, and caring about the thoughts of strangers.  Not to steer my ship for me, but to be the stars that move around me.__

It’s 4 AM and I love being alive.  I love the earth and all of its inhabitants.  I fall asleep laughing and wake up smiling.  Life is so perfect I could drink it with two straws.  Love is so amazing I could take a hot bath in it.  And my fingers would never get wrinkly.  If you don’t feel how I feel, JUST START, and then you will.  This is some raw, unadulterated, 100% organic BLISS I am experiencing right now (I’m sober, I promise), and I flat out refuse to let it fade.  Ever.  I’ll stay here, I swear I will, being intensely, intrepidly UNREASONABLE in defense of FUN and JOY, mine and yours.  The dreams, thoughts, and prayers of strangers across the globe form constellations in the sky.  At least one of them looks like a prawn.

June 2013,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/06/13/listen-up/,"June 2013, 13",LISTEN UP,"Hello everyone !

My name is Steven Page, and I live in Montreal, most precisely in the Verdun area. You may be interested in Free Shit Verdun, which is something that me, my friend (Hi, Ludauvick) and my girlfriend (Hi, Catherine) started just about a year ago.

The concept is simple : We give free shit in Verdun.

We have a free library 24/7 in front of our apartment where people can take books and also give some. From time to time, we give some free stuff with a huge “FREE” panel. It makes people happy, and our neighbours love it.

Tomorrow (Thurday the 6th), we will be doing a “Ciné Free” event, which is basically a movie that we screen in front of our apartment, near the street. People bring beer and popcorn, we vote for a movie and we chill all night. If you are in the Montreal area, you can come over if you want !

Just type Free Shit Verdun in Facebook and you’ll get all you need to know.

AND NOW, SOME FREE INSPIRATIONAL SHIT :

Here are some of my favorite quotes “An extraterrestrial being, newly arrived on Earth - scrutinizing what we mainly present to our children in television, radio, movies, newspapers, magazines, the comics, and many books - might easily conclude that we are intent on teaching them murder, rape, cruelty, superstition, credulity, and consumerism. We keep at it, and through constant repetition many of them finally get it.”

“In science it often happens that scientists say, ""You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,"" and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.”

“You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not. See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other.”

“Frederick Douglas taught that literacy is the path from slavery to freedom. There are many kinds of slavery and many kinds of freedom, but reading is still the path.”

 ALSO, BE AWARE OF THIS : Legal counterfeiting of a national currency for private gains.

AND FINALLY : I’d just like to take some time to salute someone very important to me. Cath, c’était ta fête le 31 et je crois que c’est encore temps de te faire une petite surprise. En fait, tous les jours de l’année peuvent être bons pour ça :) Alors voilà, je ne t’avais pas dit que j’avais gagné le listserve. Cette fois, c’est pas un troll, j’ai gagné pour de vrai. Tu as le visage d’un ange du moment où tu te lèves le matin jusqu’au moment où tu te couches le soir, et tout ça sans avoir à mettre de déguisement sur ton visage. Je t’aime comme ça. Tu es une des seules personnes avec qui je peux décompresser. Merci d’être chill.

GOOD DAY TO EVERYONE !!!!!! :)

June 2013,12,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/06/12/trigger-warning-house-spiders/,"June 2013, 12",(Trigger warning?) House spiders,"There are two (visible) spiders living in the bathroom window area. One lives in the sill, and the other climbs up into the shade's hanging wooden drawstring pull. That one is the smaller spider. It had molted two times and didn't seem to be growing as fast as the sill spider, who has a very round abdomen. One afternoon while moving things around on the sink, a baby spider crawled out and hung for its life with a web. For some crazy reason my first thought was to put it in the sill so it could build its own web, but you know what happened.

Of course you do.

The drawstring spider ate the baby.

Here's the pretentious part: I'm 30 and my husband and I are about to give birth to our first child this fall, so after the spider-eating-baby-spider incident, I felt like the worst Mom-to-be ever. What if someone gave my baby to a bigger baby to eat? O_o

Then that reminded me of the time my cousin got a baby bearded dragon and he let our uncle hold it. When we asked where the baby was, my uncle replied that he thought the baby could play with the full-grown beardie in another tank and... Well, you know what happened there, too.

This is probably my way of apologizing to both the spider and the baby beardie, even though only the spider's death was my fault.

By the way, we named the drawstring spider ""Horatio,"" and he has since molted and grown fatter from three houseflies I've fed him over the past month, but the fatter sill spider doesn't have a name. We haven't seen him in awhile, though. Maybe Horatio ate him, too.

Among the reasons I was excited about the move was the prospect of offsetting my takeout lunch intake with salad bar hopping. On first visit, I surveyed the bar and saw all of the wonderful things, assembling a hodge-podge of covetable ingredients. At checkout, it was a bit steep for lunch, but I scuttled to my desk to enjoy the salad anyway. The trouble was, it was a big letdown. The components were okay together, but somehow it just wasn't as good as picking Joe salad from a menu. However, I wasn't discouraged.

On return, I went in planning to make a Greek salad—one of my favorites. Mixed greens, fancy olives, tomato, red onion…no cucumber, but I used zucchini. Feta was missing, but I figured shredded mozzarella would be closer than bleu cheese. No Greek dressing, but Italian worked. Again at checkout, the salad was a bit more expensive than preferred, but it was the healthy choice. The result was just okay. I'm an optimist, so I tried again.

Consecutively, I built the staples. For caesar, I used Kalamata olives because there were no black. For wedge, ranch dressing with bleu cheese crumbles added. By the time I completed each salad, I'd replaced enough critical ingredients, the salad was no longer the amazing image I held in my head.

I ended up attributing this experience with the chain's brand. It resulted in disliking the brand that relentlessly teased me with *almost* what I needed, then overcharged me to boot. I refused to attend, when invited by co-workers.It was when one of them asked me why, and I reflected on the reason, where I realized this is a perfect metaphor for my job—and why I love what I do.

Before I transition, there is another brand that does this well—BD's Mongolian BBQ. Now, I'm not a huge fan of the place for other reasons, but their model is exemplary. Aside from the salad bar spread, they put 1-2-3 recipes on the wall to model from. This performs two functions:1) It accounts for multiple user types: the intimidated first-timer, the deviator who swaps a couple things, and it doesn't inhibit the balls-out ""do what I want"" customer.2) More importantly, however, the recipe process audits the content of the salad bar to establish a foundation for creativity—a bare-minimum set of ingredients a salad bar should contain BEFORE adding flare.

Had the grocery chain performed the same surface-level analysis of their audiences, common tasks, and balanced ""wants"" with ""needs"", their salad bar would've aced every time. They'd be able to look at X-number of bins and quantify the brand experience cost of one flare ingredient against an essential. Suddenly, my salad that's somehow more expensive than the full meal across the street would've surpassed the visage my mind, olfactories, and drool were painting—leaving my pockets emptier, but my brand bond fuller.

I used this example to setup a conference talk on structuring personas and use cases to tackle everyday user experience problems. A web designer and developer “unicorn” for some years, I settled into user experience architecture and found my calling. I love (love, love) taking abstract human problems such as this, and breaking them down to find tangible solutions—intersecting art, behavioral science, research, code, and empathy, to facilitate human bonds with non-human things like websites or ideas.Talk shop with me by Googling “anthonydpaul”.

One of the most common things people say about me is that I’m quiet. I hear it time & time again from those I just met & even from those who’ve known me for some time. Despite this, 2 years ago & in need of a job I started working at the zoo as a tour guide/bus driver, after a rough estimate I’ve calculated that I have given a tour to about 30,000 people. Yet those people and most of the people in my life won’t know as much about me than those of you that read this will at the end of this email.

I am not brave but I seem to be surrounded by people that are, if for no other reason than they have no choice.

My mom’s boyfriend was diagnosed with M.S. 7-8 years ago when he was in his 30‘s. News of which I learned while I was living in Colorado. Now that I have been back home for a couple of years I see the effects that this disease has had on him and also on my mom. I continue to try to walk around in a world where this doesn’t or won’t eventually effect me. Impermeable to the changes this disease will continue to reap on my family, only to wake up one day wondering how I washed up on shore with everyone else.

My cousin, the closest thing to a sister I have and who I have been very close with for most of my life until recently, tried to kill herself. My aunt came to me crying. My cousin has had a rough roll. Kicked out of her house while still in her teens for “coming out”, about 10 years ago. Since that time she has moved in & out of her parents home, while they all learn to live with circumstance neither of them are willing to compromise, my cousin’s side understandably. She hasn’t talked to me for almost a year, though I have tried to reach out to her. I don’t know how to reach her now without scaring her away. I can only think that the catalyst of this deep sadness comes from not being fully accepted by her family. I am not brave. She has been. I have known that I like woman for about as long as she, yet you know what people know about me? That I am quiet. She’s come out to the people that matter while I hide behind uncertainty. The best I can do is tell you all that I am a woman who likes other women. One day people are just going to have to deal with it, including myself.

I am not brave but still I change with you, breathing as you are and things as you do, but not as  you do. Even now I hide behind my computer, hide behind a white blank page that I fill with black letters, words, and sentences that run on too long with incomplete & unstable thoughts, shades of gray riddled within the meanings. The gaps in between the letters could fit a multitude of universes where inconsistency & indecision and themselves live. These universes that I drift in and out of from day to day. I’ll hide behind your courage, using your circumstances as a crutch to stay un-brave.

I’m not usually this somber but thank you for letting me vent.

The thing about this is that 9 times out of 10 we can’t control when things happen in life. Those few times that things happen at that perfect moment, life feels amazing; however for every time something doesn't happen at the perfect moment there is usually some other emotion evoked. Winning the Listserve lottery this week initially didn't strike me as perfect timing. I never thought I would get picked so had absolutely no idea what I would write about and haven’t recently experienced anything momentous or exciting to share with everyone.

So the first thought that comes to mind is why the hell is this happening now? After sitting on this for a night the conclusion I came to is that you don’t need to experience something momentous or exciting to make life feel meaningful.

I ran in the San Diego Rock n Roll half marathon this weekend. While I knew a few people doing the race I decided to actually run this one on my own. The whole theory that adrenaline gives you an extra 3-4 miles on the day of the race is definitely no joke. I run a few times a week and never feel the high that I felt after crossing the starting line. After about 3 miles into it I started to realize how amazing this whole thing was. With the thousands of people running this and the hundreds cheering along the sidelines the entire 13 miles it hit me that this wasn't just something to say I've done. If you know me you know this isn't an exaggeration but this definitely gave me major goosebumps. Running isn't for everyone but even if you decide to walk the whole way I recommend participating in one of these in your lifetime. They have them all over the world now and it’s definitely an amazing feeling to be part of something like this.

Because of the lack of having something else inspirational, thought evoking, or just plain interesting to share with you guys I figure I would give you a list of the little things in life that make me happy. Hopefully some of these interest people and they can add them to their list of little things J

-         Las Vegas – because it’s the adult Disneyworld

-          Naps – that moment after you wake up from a really really good one

-          Laughing until it hurts or you pee your pants – pretty sure everyone has this on their list already

-          Getting dressed up for something fancy – maybe it’s because I’m a girl but you forget how much fun this can be

-          Dancing – even if you think you can’t do it, do it

-          Sneezing – never stop someone from sneezing; it’s a fact that it’s a 1/8th of an orgasm

-          Seeing a really good movie – it can make you laugh, cry, or just think about life… either way you can’t deny it’s a good feeling

-          A good cry – even though at the time it’s usually because of something sad the way you feel after is indescribable

-          Making a new friend – you never know what it could turn into but the excitement of that is half the fun

There’s a ton more that I could list but I’m running out of space so I will have to end it on that one. I always love to make new friends so feel free to shoot me an email and let me know what little things you have on your list!

I kind of feel like I’ve had to carry that assumption my entire life. Most people’s reaction when I say “Oh, yea. I’m from West Virginia!” isn’t “What a beautiful state! With such rich history!” It’s normally “Oh….” Followed by a quick look at the watch and a dash in the other direction. Great for making friends.

I love West Virginia in the way you might love a senile grandmother. She helped raise you and in general, she’s well meaning, but she also likes to shout racist things in public and can’t help walking outside without clothes on from time to time. I want to be proud of my state in the flag waving way so many people I grew up with are, but I can’t help but only quietly come to her aid when someone starts getting down on some of her more unusual habits.

Because in a lot of ways, those criticisms are well founded. There appears to be very little hope of advancement for so many people in the state. Literacy isn’t always a number one priority. Many of the jobs like coal and steel that were instrumental in bringing jobs and commerce to the state have left leaving people unemployed and with little training to be used in other professions. We’re ranked the unhappiest and one of the most obese states in the nation. Poverty is rampant in so many areas of the state and there doesn’t seem too much to be done about any of it.

And therein lies my conflict. I recognize the problems and feel like I should do something to help but my first reaction has always been to run. As soon as I realized how isolated I felt by the state I was supposed to call mother, I mapped out an escape plan ready to leave. And I did. I left. Call it abandonment; call it copping out, but no matter.

There’s always one feature that I always come back to, though. It always strikes me when I leave the state how…flat everywhere else feels. When I cross into Ohio over the river on my way to anywhere else, it always feels like the walls fell down. It always seems like I can see for miles and in a lot of ways I feel very exposed. I guess I got used to my Mountain Mama keeping up castle walls to protect me. And I always, always miss the mountains when I leave.

I think West Virginia is easily the most beautiful state in the Union. Driving through it during the fall is breathtaking. It looks like the hills caught on fire. For me, that’s enough to keep my coming back.

Here’s hoping your country roads take you wherever you call home.

June 2013,07,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/06/07/astride-a-dark-horse/,"June 2013, 07",Astride a dark horse,"My name is Ryan. I'm 30 years old and I live on a houseboat on the canals of London, England.

My boat's name is the Dark Horse.  I have owned it for 5 months. I am told that the constant fear of sinking eventually goes away.

The boat was built in 1974. It is 50ft long and 10ft wide, with every square foot replete in only the finest in late 70's wood-panelling. Its heart is a marinised BMC engine - the same kind that used to be found in black London taxis - and, like most of those who partied hard through the 70's, it has a tendency to occasionally forget who it is and what it's doing, and to suddenly and violently require a bit of a lie-down. This usually involves loud noises and, occasionally, smoke.(When I purchased the boat from an elderly widower, she gave me a 'Good Luck' card instead of a 'Thank You' card. In retrospect this should have been something of a clue.)

As I have no permanent mooring (due, for the most part, to the scarcity of new mooring spots in London), my boat operates under what's called a 'continuous cruising license.' Besides being the basis for some truly terrible pickup lines, this entails being legally obligated to move the boat to a new neighbourhood every two weeks.¹  This has proven to be my favourite part of the boating life thus far.  Waking up to the sound of joggers along the towpath at Victoria Park is very different to waking up to the gentle splash of a rower on the River Lea or to the distant sound of a genuine Camden punk being heartily sick. The experience has broadened my appreciation of London and its environs.

But the boat life isn't all glamorous 70's decor, punk vomit, and hastily purchased Hallmark cards.  There are also downsides.Besides the aforementioned threat of sinking and the obvious, constant danger of scurvy, the waterways of England are also infested with swans.  While in the past the Queen (the only person legally allowed to kill swans in the United Kingdom²) has done a fine job of culling back the white-winged menace, her age and subsequent wavering aim has meant she's far less capable of wielding the royal machete than once she was. As a result, the swans, emboldened, have taken to hanging around in groups, smoking cigarettes, and making lewd comments at passing womenfolk.  We boaters have thus far managed to endure this outrage through sheer willpower, numerous cups of tea, and the sound knowledge that should ever Prince Harry take the throne, he's likely to bring the full force of the British army against these beautiful, feathered abominations.

That day is to be found in the distant future, though, if at all, and so until then my fellow boaters and I must simply try to get by, pottering along from place to place, arguing with our engines and watching 'Waterworld' for the 50th time. It's an wonderful movie, really, and Kevin Costner is actually quite good in it.

Thanks for reading.

Actually tonight I'm in a wind shelter by a still and beautiful lake and in front of me there is a small fire, the sun is setting,and on my lap, my laptop.

I'm a developer. I moved to a tent into the forest to be able to code on my startup project full time.Not only does that give me the time to do this but it also gives me peace of mind.I change my location about two times a week.

Computer, forest, batteries...? Unpractical? Maybe it would have been more rational to keep the apartment and just cut costs?Well, rational and right do not always align.

I have no apartment, I have no job and I have no income.Still I'm exactly where I should be. I'm on my path. My gut feeling lets me know that.

I'm not exiting to a normal life until my startup has taken off. This is my big adventure. I'm not coming back empty handed.

Small notes on how to do this:    I power my laptop, phone and external battery with two portable Brunton 62 Watt solar panels.    I cook nice food on my Primus OmniLite stove.    I live in a comfortable Hilleberg tent.    I carry all 35 kg in a Norrona Recon back pack.

There's my live, 35 kg. It should not take more to slay the dragon, win the kingdom and divorce the princess.Well I do also have a car. C'mon, dragon slayer without a horse?

If you are in the startup business you know that raising capital is not easy.I speak to some seeders. They love my idea. I mean everyone I speak to love it, but the seederssay it's to early to invest in without having actually seen the product. Maybe they're right. Hard for meto decide, I'm a bit biased.

I can't really tell you what I'm doing, but yesterday I read this in an article by Adam Wiggins:""Software is eating the world. Everyone can and should be able to write software in order to have a stake in the future.""This is exactly what I'm doing. Bringing software development to the masses.

The lulz requires this, me and my designer Micael are looking for:    Javascript/HTML/CSS haxx0rs with a sense of design.    C++/Lua/GNU/Linux gurus.    Investors in IT that want to break new ground.Not that we could pay you any bucks, but the lulz are the lulz. =)

If you want to see some pictures of my forest life, try my blog, it's my fullname dot com.Or follow me on Twitter, my Twitter id is also my full name.

Quitting my apartment and my job at the same time was really hard to do.I had elevated adrenalin levels for days. To sooth the waves of anxiety that swept over me regularly, I had one picturethat I kept looking at. It was a picture of the beautiful forest which I was to move to. That gave me strength totake the steps necessary to get on the trail.

I really hope you're on your path or taking calculated steps to get there. However big or small it may be.

Some kisses and some hugs and remember to stay true. But you already knew that.

June 2013,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/06/05/do-it-for-yourself/,"June 2013, 05",Do It For Yourself,"I've been reading nuggets of joy, nuggets of sadness, and nuggets of great information from fellow Listserver writers. I've pined and pined over my chance to find something to say. What would I say? Would I procrastinate, despite having 48 solid hours to come up with something? BAM. It hit me.

  My dream is to be a great writer someday. I will either write a novel directed at women, or create books and books of poetry. I'd love to create something for women of color, specifically. However, I create all the time and hit writer's block quickly. While the dream hasn't died, I've shifted over to poetry. Poetry is rich, poetry is exciting, poetry is a diary entry--shortened. I've fallen madly in love with it--so much to the point where I've self-published a short body of work from the first half of a fake leather book I was given in 2008.

  I challenged myself with the project. I named the file ""Four Years"", and decided that no matter what, I was doing this for myself. I wanted to prove that I could dedicate myself to something I loved. Unlike the many ""darlings"" rotting in my writing folder, this darling was going to live and grow. This was a ""darling"" that wasn't going to be killed.

  I must admit that I had high, somewhat pretentious hopes about people buying my book. I made it available on Kindle and at CreateSpace, rambled about it on my tumblr page, and guess what? ONE person bought it. Overjoyed, I knew more people were coming. Well, they never did. Was I disappointed? A little bit. However, I was still high off the joy of completing something. I was high off something I'd done for myself. I reflected on the late nights I spent at my desk with coffee, music, and my own fingers dancing across the keyboard. I reflected on rushing home for my hard copy to review before the final print.

  It wasn't about the money, the notoriety, or any kind of praise. I did it for myself. That's so important! Why? I was letting everything I could think of hold me back. I feared self publishing because of the negative commentary I read on a blog. I feared putting myself out there, anticipating ridicule. I'm not a master poet! I'm not going to poetry slams and reads. I'm a quiet woman who types from her room computer and iPod Touch when the muse rubs my noggin. My poems are strange little stanzas about my life. I get a like or two, you know? Nothing special.

  However, I just want to close and say this--do it for yourself. No matter what it is, focus on the goal. Doing it for yourself means you're showing love for yourself. It means you're doing something for YOU. Sure, it might affect someone in your circle. It might improve the life of your family in the process, but we often forget ourselves in this life. We often feel like something is missing. So therefore, doing something for yourself is like giving yourself a great gift to grow from and learn from. So years from now, you can quietly (or noisily) say to yourself....

I DID IT FOR ME.

  Love yourself endlessly. Be kind to yourself. Invest in the one relationship that determines how you treat others. Remember what RuPaul says--""If you can't love yourself, how in the heck you gonna love somebody else?"" As you do for yourself, I'll be cheering for you. You can do it!

Like who you actually are?  Is it your childhood, your friends, your family?  How do you find out who defines you, or what defines you?  Or do you ever?

For me, it was in 1998.  Six months until I was getting married, and I couldn’t feel my feet.  Then I couldn’t see half of everything (think headless bodies).  Then I couldn’t feel my hands.  So, the neurologist said… its MS.  I just wanted to know that I was going to live.  Anything else, I would deal with.  And I did.  I live with MS, it’s who I am, and yet not who I am all at the same time.  It defines me and I both define and defy it.  I work with it.  I live with it.  I am a mother with it.  I laugh with it.  I cry with it.  I am mad at it, and yet, I am happy with it.  And if it feels the same about me, I hope I make it mad.  I define it, and I defy it.  I get up with it.  I go on vacation with it.  I wear it in my sneakers and walk it with my cane.  I move with it, I move on with it, and maybe one day we can be friends.  But until then…I will prove it wrong.

I think that’s the definition of what we all should be.  We should actually be the ability to prove it wrong.  Whatever it is.  MS, any chronic illness, any non-chronic illness, any time and any where someone or something asks who you are… define yourself.  Anyone who says you can’t, prove them wrong.  Anything that says you shouldn’t, prove it wrong.  So, just be.  Be you, be the best you that you can be.  Get up every morning, put your feet on the ground, and go.  Go prove them wrong!

PS – I made a video for a well known company that I hope will inspire people with MS, and any other chronic illnesses to hang in there.  If you would like to see it, please email me.

PPS- I am an avid reader, and love all types of books, both fiction and non-fiction (but not really science fiction).  I would love to hear from you with book suggestions, and if you would like, I can give you some of mine.

Thanks everyone!

At the girl's school located in Seoul in the mid 1990s, when 'lighter' skin tone was considered very trendy nationwide, her flawless light skin was highly praised as an element of beauty. Her facial tone was actually so pale that I once even heard some girls call hers 'leukemic-pale skin'. Obviously it sounded like an inappropriate description, but for carefree young teenage girls, it seemed to be just another way of expressing their jealousy of not having that lightness. 

One summer, I had a chance to go to summer camp with her as a group. On our second night, she fainted out shortly. She insisted on staying and finishing the 3-day camp with the rest of us. After she came back, she visited a hospital to get a check-up and was diagnosed with leukemia. She passed away after six months. 

Her pale skin was a manifestation of the disease, and calling it 'leukemic' without knowing the underlying disease must have been a coincidence. I barely knew her personally. I have no idea what type of leukemia it was. But somehow, the phrase 'leukemic pale skin' stuck in my brain: Since then, I try to watch my mouth in a certain manner; I try not to use words that contain inappropriate meaning if there's any alternative option.  I do not particularly believe that positive thinking brings good luck. But I tend not to use unnecessarily inappropriate words either.

Let's be nicer to each other. Above all, why not?

In the contemporary classical world, ensembles commission composers to write pieces for them to perform.  Cadillac Moon had commissioned pieces from some of the composers in Circles and Lines previously, but now was completing the set (Including commissioning me!).  This concert was the culmination of six months of hard work trying to get nine people in the same room at the same time, and ladies and gents, you better believe that was the hardest part about this project.In December, the two groups won the MetLife Creative connections grant, which paid Circles and Lines and Cadillac Moon for question and answer sessions, workshops, interviews, and broadcasts.  We had set up two interviews to be conducted before the big concert, an open rehearsal to be live streamed over the Internet, and a question and answer session to be conducted after the concert.  From February, when we started organizing, to May 17th, when the concert happened, we found three days where all our schedules aligned enough to sit down and conduct the two radio interviews and the open rehearsal.  In fact, we were so desperate to find a day that worked; we did one of the interviews and the open rehearsal on the same day.  Combine the constant stress of finding a way to put 9 particular bodies in the same place with the need to operate complex technical infrastructure built from scratch and last minute orders for software, and you can see how Murphy’s Law can come to dominate some of what we were trying to do.  Ultimately we were able to pull through and create a series of events that were both rewarding and fun.These days, many people unfamiliar with the arts tend to think that being a composer or performer means furiously practicing or composing under the constant inspiration of Euterpe.  In reality we are frequently forced to put on hats ranging from chief IT officer to recording engineer to project manager to PR hack.  To create an artistic project from scratch, one has to be incredibly versatile in their abilities, flexible in their thinking and above all persistent.

1. Learn how to drive, and use that knowledge. Like using blinkers, and moving over when you're going slower than the general speed of traffic. Also use common courtesy. I can't stress that last part enough.

2. Quit using listserve for your religious purposes. Its not cool to force your beliefs on others. But I guess why else would you email thousands of people to get your message out?

3.  On dating, if you feel like your significant other is the best thing in your life, treat them as such. Don't let them slip through your fingers.

4. Get a pet. Doesn't matter what kind. I have a couple of cats and they are awesome. One plays fetch, and the other is horribly mean to anybody but me. I know it sounds strange to keep a mean cat, but she's old and cute and she likes me.

5. Its not too late to ""fix"" your life. Go back to school, learn something new or a hobby. 

6. Go out on a limb and do something out of the ordinary. Live outside the box. My new years resolution (two years running) have been to try something new every month and see a show or go to an event every month as well. I've been completely successful with that.

Just live life. Same thing more better.

I took the Rainbow bus south from my house to my best friend’s house, then we’d take the Tropicana bus east to Maryland Parkway to Balcony Lights.

 The shows were always on punk time so they wouldn’t be starting for another hour, at least. We’d go upstairs and read zines or comics in the zine library, our impressionable minds fascinated by the revolutionary ideas of CrimethInc.

 We saw Kaospilot, Van Johnson, Bafabegiya, Curl Up and Die, This Virus Makes Us Human, Zann, D’amore, and End of a Year, maybe all in one summer. These shows were the first time I can remember feeling like a part of something bigger than myself, crowded together with dozens of sweaty bodies, moshing around with the restrained aggression of angry punks that wanted to fuck shit up… without knocking any of the records off the wall. We had a really cool secret, avant garde and hardcore.

 I picked up flyers there for crazy house shows that I’m still not sure how I convinced my parents to drop me off at. Later, I dropped off flyers there for my own shows. Later still, I came to help clean up and pick through the last of the records as the record store that raised me, closed its doors.

 I love Balcony Lights.

The kitchen is a pool of light that smells like coffee. The darkness outside pushes against the windows. The house is cold. No one else will be up for hours. Your father pours boiling water out of the glass-lined thermos. A cloud of steam envelops his head. ""Always heat the thermos up first. Coffee'll get cold otherwise."" He fills it from the coffee pot and slides the thermos into a denim holder.

Your father drives through the darkness in the van with the heat off. You are in your snowsuit and mittens. Your father wears a canvas snowmobile suit and a blue down vest. ""Turn the heat on now, it'll just feel colder. This way we get used to it."" Your ears are numb. It is February and at 5:30 AM twilight is still a half hour away. You puff out a breath in front of your face and watch it writhe in the dashboard lights.

""Stop that. You're fogging up the windows.""

Your father's rubber boots crunch across the frozen beach. He carries the ice fishing gear, a backpack, and a long black steel pole. You have been given the denim thermos pouch and its precious bottle. You marvel at how the beach looks just like a summer beach, but your boots crunch across the surface of the frozen sand and leave no marks. It's like a beach made of concrete. You take a step onto the ice and the world tips sharply and the frozen lake hits you on the side of the head. It doesn't feel like anything.

""Jesus."" Your father stoops over you and pulls you up. He takes the thermos and shakes it next to his head. It makes a sloshing noise. ""Nothing broken. The ice is slippery. No snow. Keep your feet underneath you. You'll be fine.""

You walk across the ice together until you reach a piece of ice that looks exactly like every other piece of ice to you. ""Right here,"" says your father, and he drops the backpack and puts down the fishing gear. He raises the steel bar up and lets it fall. The chisel end chops a divot out of the ice in front of his feet. He shuffles around in a circle, chopping. Your father's face is neutral and composed as he does this. He doesn't breathe hard or struggle. He just raises the bar and lets it fall, like a machine that will raise a bar and let it fall at a steady pace until you make it stop.

The bar chips through and the center of the hole starts to fill with slush, then water. The water is shockingly black against the white ice. Across the lake, the ice booms and squeals, like an animal in pain. It makes noises like a metal garbage can rolling down a hill. It cracks like a branch breaking. It never stops making noise. You had never thought that ice might have a sound.

""There."" You look down at the hole. It is perfectly round, and filled with still black water. When your father steps near it, the surface of the water rises and then lowers again without forming any ripples. You try to imagine what could live down there, sealed underneath a foot of ice for months in that black water. Whatever it is, you don't think you want to catch it.

As a veteran from a family with a long military history, Memorial Day means a lot to me.  But not really for the reason that most people think.  There is a difference between Memorial Day and Veteran's Day.  Veteran's Day is the one where we give thanks to all that have served, but Memorial Day is supposed to be a somber day set aside for remembrance of those that have died serving their country.  It is just a day for a barbecue or a killer sale at Best Buy or the like.  It is not a happy day.  If you want to see what Memorial Day is really about, search for the video of the Marine that stood at attention and saluted for something like 6 hours during the Rolling Thunder parade in D.C.  He was there to salute his fellow Marines that could not be there because they made the ultimate sacrifice.

I don't think I can sum it up any better than my friend did today on Facebook.  She is a master sergeant in the Air Force.  She wrote:

""Please learn and teach your children the difference between Memorial Day and Veteran's Day. If you want to thank a Veteran - thank them on Veteran's Day or any other day of the year if you're so inclined.""

""Memorial Day is set aside for remembering those that died while serving their country. It is not a happy day. It is a day of rememberance of comrades, friends, and family members who have fallen in service to their country. Never wish anyone a Happy Memorial Day. If you can't think of something more appropriate to say, simply say nothing. We understand and respect your silence much more than your cheery well wishes.""

Almost 7 ½  years ago, my 3 sisters and I realized that even though we all lived close, we didn't see each other often. We have always been a close family, but between work and taking care of our families, we were letting too much time go by between visits. After our mother died in 2003, we all grieved separately, coming together mostly for holidays.  We have always been a family that puts fun on the top of our list, but after mama died, our fun times together became fewer and farther between.I am not sure who came up with the brilliant idea of setting aside one Saturday a month, come hell or high water, that we would do SOMETHING together.  We really had not formulated a long term plan.The first Sisters’ Day outing was in January of 2006.  We started off easy -  with a trip to an Antique Mall and lunch,  A couple of more trips and we discovered our passion…….HIKING!  So the majority our Sisters’ Day have been day trips to State Parks.  When the weather is too cold or too hot we choose something else:  a play, a museum, botanical gardens or a movie.  We have had some wonderful adventures, but whatever we do, we find humor, laugh til we cry (or wet our pants) and sing all the songs we know (and some we don’t!)  Occasionally we even allow our younger brother, Bill, to tag along.We have gotten lost on unmarked trails in the North Georgia Mountains, had picnics in the rain, gone to a Kangaroo conservatory, a butterfly Festival, saw some great shows at the Fox Theater, discovered a frozen waterfall on Pigeon Mountain, and climbed to the top of Amicolola Falls. We have hiked countless miles, visited wildlife parks, and corn mazes.  We had a whirlwind trip to the beach…………yes in one day…….we drove 5 hours to Tybee Island, basked in the sun, had a picnic, toured a Fort and drove the 5 hours back.  Our big day trip was to NYC in December of 2008.  We boarded a flight from Atlanta at 5 am, got to New York and hit the ground running!  Top of the Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square, Staten Island Ferry, Ground Zero then back to Atlanta by 2am.  What a wonderful, exhilarating exhausting day!No matter what the “trip of the month is” long or short, we make the most of it. It is not so much WHAT you do or WHERE you go, but the time that is spent with one another.  Don’t let time slip away and the stress of everyday living get in the way of making time for family. It doesn't have to be expensive or time consuming. But you have to make a conscious effort.Now after 89 trips, countless hours in the car together, hundreds of miles hiked, and dozens and dozens of picnics ………we are still going strong and we are still having fun!I would love to hear from you and your thoughts or experiences about family and your time together!

Yours truly,Susan"

Most of us know our ups and downs, those moments when you think it couldn't get any worse, but then it does. Or those, when you're just feeling overwhelmed by your past, present and the future you imagine yourself in. You know the deal, felt that darkness, I guess.

I have a best friend. Her name is Tina, and through the years she had to deal with quite a few bad things happening to her, herself. Lately, she hasn't been feeling well and I really wish for her to feel better soon, and to not feel guilty about being in the state that she is in right now. I love her. I won't give up on her. She is a great person. In fact one of the kindest, most intelligent, funny and warm ones I have ever met. So, I guess what I want her to know, is, that she's not alone. And that everything about her is right, and being sad is not a personal flaw of hers. And if you, the person getting this e-mail, are feeling sad or lonely, I wish for you to feel better soon! I know there are things in life, that make you feel like the sun won't come out anymore. Please talk to someone. If not a friend, maybe a professional. You are not weak just for asking for help. You. are. not.

This one is for her, for my wonderful friends and the ones feeling lost. You're not!  If any of you want to give Tina the warm fuzzies, I would appreciate it a lot!

Love. Take care of yourself. Look out for each other.

Mathematical beauty is ""my thing"", but I can't give you pictures! (But you can search for my name; I seem to be the only one on the Web.)

*\\*

I've been a political (or antipolitical) radical for long enough to lose the appetite for preaching without provocation.  But I'll take this opportunity to make one point about the word CAPITALISM, which means at least two very different things:

* A free market, in which private property and services   are exchanged without anyone's permission.

* Government benefits to existing businesses, including subsidies   and regulations designed to prevent or discourage competition   from new businesses.

Conservative politicians point to the first to gain approval for the second. Progressive politicians point to the second to scare you away from the first. Despite their rivalry for office, they share a vital interest in preserving the system, and thus in obscuring the difference between the two ""capitalisms"".

So I've stopped using the word ""capitalism"", at least on its own. For the first I say ""free market"" or ""open market"". I haven't quite decided what to call the second; it has been called ""crony capitalism"" and ""neo-mercantilism"".

Next time you use or hear the word ""capitalism"", I hope you'll stop and ask, ""Wait, which capitalism?""

In a baking dish, melt one-third of a stick (40g) of butter. Blend in half a cup (118cc) of honey, one tablespoon (15cc) of prepared mustard, and one tablespoon (15cc) of curry powder.

True to style, I've left this to last minute (won't be pulling an all-nighter for the Listserve, so this has to be sent off before bed-time, no exceptions) and haven't spent much time on what to talk about, or why I should.  

It's going to be easiest if I pick something fresh in my head. And since I procrastinated to get here... procrastination it is. Yesterday I had an argument (neither of us angry, so maybe 'argument' isn't the right word) with my partner-in-crime, about my lack of follow-through on things that interest me. He thinks I could do more with the things I know, and he hates seeing me do things he sees as a waste of time. I think he's got a point, but I also partially disagree.

There are a lot of things I like. I love to learn, even if that learning never goes further than being useful when it's pub trivia night. I put into practice some of the things I've learned, but most of it just sits there in my head. 

His point (I think) is that I should put my interests into practice more, because I have it all there so I shouldn't waste it. Make stuff, write things, become better at things that are right now more like abstract interests than actual skills, so I can make more things. 

It is disheartening to think about how little I give back to the people who've taught me things. The internet is perfect for people like me: I can learn whatever I want, because other people have done the work to put it out there. I wonder how many people actually contribute actively to the internet, excluding Facebook and blogging. Surely there's not all that many people, proportionately, creating and contributing to the giant crazy online world the rest of us get to enjoy. More watchers than makers. Perhaps it's always been that way.

Back to the argument ('discussion'?). He's a consummate maker, and it suits him. I don't know many people who DO as much creatively as he does. I'm not sure I'll ever keep up, and I think that's ok. With that said, I definitely should do less of the putting-stuff-off, and more of the 'doing'. But I'd like to extend his definition of 'making stuff that's worthwhile' beyond just unique creations. I reckon it should also count if you can plan a great party, or have a well-kept garden, or can name all the moons of Jupiter. The things I like to read about feed into making me myself, which feeds through into everything else I do. 

What do you think? How much do you 'output'? Is it enough to just learn? I'd like to know what you think, even if it's that I'm being wanky and dull and should stop rambling. Which I'll do now, in any case. Thanks for listening!

My mom is an English professor. During one of her classes, she looked at her students and asked ""How many of you here would identify as a feminist?"". To her dismay, about three or four of the twenty-some students raised their hands, and all of them were female.

""Let me ask you something,"" she said. ""How many of you believe in equal rights for women?"" Everyone raised their hands. ""How many of you believe women should be paid the same amount as men in the workplace?"" They all raised her hands again. Mom smiled. ""Then you are all feminists.""

The first two definitions of feminism, as per dictionary.com, are:

fem·i·nism[fem-uh-niz-uhm] Show IPAnoun1.the doctrine advocating social, political, and all other rights of women equal to those of men.2.( sometimes initial capital letter  ) an organized movement for the attainment of such rights for women.

If you'll look, you see none of the common misconceptions of feminism, which include:1. hating men2. burning bras3. getting angry when men hold doors open for them4. trying to take over the world with our feminine wiles5. obliterating men altogther and releasing them as a fine powder into the atmosphere (okay, I'm embellishing just a bit)

The reality is that feminists are sick of the way women are portrayed, the way they are pitted against each other and the way that society tells their bodies are shameful and that they should hate them for not looking good enough for men.

Yesterday I had a guy refuse to let me help him lift heavy things for the mere fact that I was a woman, even though I had just carried one of those ""heavy"" things (which, for the record, really weren't that heavy) across the floor to him with ease. Instead of standing there and arguing with him, I decided it said more about him than me, and I left. And that was when I knew what to write about for the Listserve.

A few traditional sexist practices need a little clarification, too. If a man refuses to hit a woman because he just doesn't hit women, he's doing it for the wrong reason. You shouldn't hit a woman because she's a person, just like you shouldn't hit a man because he's a person. When you hold a door open for a woman, you should hold it open because it's polite to hold a door open for anyone. And, regardless of which gender the person holding the door open identifies with, you should always say thank you. But that's a ""common courtesy"" issue, so I'll stop there.

My aim with this e-mail wasn't necessarily to change minds, but rather to help some of you understand that you might just be a feminist without knowing it. And that's okay. Most of the negative aspects associated with feminism are radical and certainly not the thoughts of every feminist, or are non-existant altogether.

I have a lot to say on various topics, not all of them necessarily political, social, or even negative. If you're interested, I invite you to check out my blog. Google ""kcooperwriting"" and you'll find me a few links down under my Twitter account.

Thanks for reading. I've really enjoyed all the Listserve e-mails so far, especially those with projects linked to them.

May 2013,21,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/05/21/a-sense-of-place/,"May 2013, 21",A Sense of Place,"Hi there,

If we've met before, hi again.

My name is Anthony Albright and I am lost. In that, my hobby is drifting — across places, across people, across ideas. I enjoy finding myself surprised and delighted by the energy of the city street, which finds its own uses for things.

If you were at Nicole He's Listserve Internet Picnic in Prospect Park last August, you might remember me as the fifteen-year-old from San Diego. If we got to chatting — or if we ever have, for that matter — I've probably told you that my greatest fascination is with airport wayfinding signage.

Wayfinding signage represents for me an intermodality that I understand as a cognizance of the nuances that distinguish for us between platforms and cast a sense of place. This intermodality is some kind of fully lucid weave through fleeting moments of interstitial space.

It is a consciousness that I have come to understand as a constant process of at once being completely awash in the present and being a complete reflection of everything from there to now.

It is a hasty jog across the metro station platform, as a transfer is made from one arriving train to the next departing one. It is the intuitive dance of starting to dismount from your bicycle as it is still decelerating, so that as it comes to a full stop, you find it at your side. It is a foray into the crosswalk on a brisk afternoon. As your hands dig into your coat pockets, your head falls into a low nod as you lean your leading foot off the curb. You are compelled onto the street and into a future that becomes the very moment.

To characterize this consciousness of being lost in the city, I think immediately of a prose poem written by Charles Baudelaire, stumbled upon during a long trip taken to my city's central library a few weeks ago.

…'O night! O refreshing darkness! For me you are the signal of an inner festival, you are deliverance from anguish. In the solitude of the plain [...],  the blaze of streetlights, you are the fireworks of the goddess Liberty.'

It is now 1:24 a.m. on Sunday, May 19th, 2013. I gaze at the soft red luminescence of the late-night MTS trolley car and I hear the distant sputter of the viscera that is the city at this hour.

This multi-sensory post-midnight glow that San Diego is bathed in, I am awash in it. And it is most beautiful.

I find myself now in tenth grade, but that does not mean that I am not an unschooler at heart. This means that I allow myself to be awash in everything. It entails frequent trips to San Diego's Lindbergh Field. I visit not to travel, but to take in the experience of movement. It entails getting lost in people too. For the very first time last month, I found myself in the position of being chastised by my high school for engaging in a very public display of affection. I have never felt more complete.

Reader, write me an email. We're both so very real. Let's relish in that. Let's start something. Maybe we can partake in some shared meaningfulness. Maybe we can mesh our personal networks of dots into something completely unlike anything else.

I don't know. I really don't know. But I can tell you that I will do my very best.

Oh, and thank you, everyone at the Internet Picnic, for a most wonderful afternoon.

Today's winner, Hesham Naiem, graciously tweeted us: ""@thelistserve Today's mail (my Turn) is not what i sent and repeated from yesterday with different subject with my name  I'm Very Lucky."" Sorry, Hesham. Here's his message:

***

What is the purpose of everything?

How did we get here?

""What is the meaning of Life?""

You might be amazed to learn, that Islam is providing clear and concise answers for these questions. Have you heard about “The Stanford Prison Experiment”? Or maybe you’ve seen the movie “The Experiment”? . Zimbardo is a famous psychologist who used to teach at Stanford University, and made this experiment. Twenty-four males were part of it; twelve were assigned the roles of “prisoners” and the other twelve were assigned the roles of “guards”. A mock prison was created.

Each person had to play their role for two weeks. However, the experiment had to stop after six days as a result of what happened. The participants got too involved in their roles, that it had become more to them than just an experiment. The guards who were given ultimate power and wooden batons became extremely violent and tortured the prisoners. The prisoners on the other hand suffered from depression and humiliation as a result of the guards’ acts.

I recently watched the movie and I couldn’t stop thinking; “What were those people thinking? How did this happen? They knew it was an experiment, how could they just drift into it like this?”

Then I realized how this experiment could be a metaphor of this Life we are living in. This Life is temporary! We all know that, but for some reason most of us do not live according to it. We strive to build careers as if it is the end of the world. We fight for money even with the closest of people. We worry about tomorrow when we are not even sure we will make it through today.

These things can do little or nothing to bring happiness because regardless of what he or she would gain in this life they would always live in fear of what will happen to them in the end.

Worship of the [Allah in Arabic] as a primary goal or aim in life provides a believer with everything he needs. The word for total surrender, submission, obedience, purity of heart and peace in the Arabic language is ""Islam"". Those who try to perform these actions are called ""Muslims"" .

Because Islam teaches that this life is only a test or trial for the individual to show him his true nature, it is only natural that he would accept death as not so much an ending to everything but more as a beginning of the final and lasting life in the Hereafter.

Every person will be rewarded [or punished] according to their attitude, efforts during this stay on earth. None will be asked about the actions and beliefs of others, nor will anyone be asked regarding that which he was unaware of or incapable of doing. As a result, The Permanent or Afterlife will either be spend in luxurious splendor(Heaven) or miserable punishment (Hell)

This life is very meaningful and purposeful to the Muslim, as he realizes that it will determine his outcome and permanent position in the Next Life. For a disbeliever the purpose of this life is to collect and amass great wealth, money, power and position. But all of this will not avail them anything good in the in the Next Life.

Look how Islam solves the mystery of life. It provides the answers to the questions and concern of the human beings on all levels .It is quite simple. The purpose of life as understood by the Muslim can be simply stated in only two words:

Obey God!

The majority of emails are about people's life stories and advice.  I thought I'd do the same and also teach you something crazy at the end anyone can learn to do.

I don't think life needs to complicated.  Keep people in your life you enjoy being with who support you to pursue opportunities that allow you to live closer to the life you want to live.   In turn you do the same for them.

I'm 24 years old and deep into the ""experience and learn as much as possible"" time of my life.  This is all with boundaries of course (I don't want to experience what it's like to take Heroin).  I feel very fortunate to have experienced things like winning a national soccer championship in University, having an amazing connected intimate relationship, and experiencing different cultures through travelling.  I've learned a lot so far and I'm excited to experience and learn more in the coming years.

I remember having a conversation with an older man (about 50 years old) who has a very good understanding of the state of the world and how it works.  He basically said our generation was screwed and there was no way to fix things like rising global temperatures and the economic systems of countries like the USA.   I thought that was a very pessimistic way of looking at it, but I could understand why he thought that way.  He doesn't know what our generation knows about the potential of technology.

I've come to the conclusion that the world is going to be a very different place in the next 30 years because of technology.   I see it as a good kind of change that brings more abundance and freedom into people's lives.  Soon we will be able to print anything that needs replacing in our bodies (we've done a heart).   More small businesses will start and be be successful due to the vast amount of public information they are able to analyze and make better decisions from.   Jobs will become more enjoyable and fulfilling as the monotonous, repetitive tasks are taken care of by machines and software.  Staying connected with the people you want in your life will be even easier.   I could be wrong (I'm only 24 years old), but it makes me excited for what's to come and the opportunity to take part and build some of it.  There's already a plan to start the colonization of Mars in 2023 with the Mars One reality show, so not many other things seem too crazy.

I'll leave you with something you can take away.  About 6 years ago I started learning about something called lucid dreaming.  Those who don't know it's the ability to realize your in a dream and then experience the dream world as if you're awake.  At first I thought it was just some ridiculous thing hippies said they could do...I'm a logical engineer after all.  For the hell of it I did some research, practiced some techniques, and within 2 months I started having them.   Being able to recreate scenes and fly around them while shooting fireballs out of your hands is a lot more fun than just going to sleep and waking up.   The craziest thing I tried was asking someone in a dream what it was like to be in a dream (you'll have to learn how to lucid dream to see how that worked out).  Here's a guide on how to start learning http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Lucid_Dreaming/Induction_Techniques#Reality_checks.  You really just have to take 20 seconds out of your day to build up the habits (it takes 2 weeks to form a habit).

Many take this idea as a bad or ominous sign about the destruction we cause upon the planet but I conversely consider it the single greatest thing that we can ever do. As humans we have been placed into a niche that no other species has ever been in. We have become the protectors and purveyors of life.

In the event of a large disaster, one that could cause mass extinctions, humans are at an interesting position in their ability to control and prevent such events. We have the ability to stop a meteorite from striking the earth in the same manner we can prevent almost any known cataclysm from striking our planet. This places us in the position of being the protectors of life on earth. Currently the planet tolerates what we are doing to it. With the current rate of destruction upon the nature with a rather conservative plan to end the destruction we will have killed more then 10% of the diversity of life on earth. This pales in comparison to what a single meteorite of a decent size will do. Having us in a position to prevent this truly makes our actions required to gain the technological and scientific standing that allows us to protect life rational.

We as humans will eventually have the ability to do something even more grand and overall important. Life as we know it is trapped on this planet. Earth is a limited place with limited resources, limited space and limited time. Earth certainly will not be around forever and we, as the technologically advanced species of earth, can leave and travel throughout the galaxy. At the time of writing this message over 850 planets outside of our solar system have been discovered with many in the habitable zone around their stars and there are even some that are truly earthlike. We as humans can travel forth and bring life to these planets. Inevitably we will bring the diversity of life from our planet along with us and guarantee the spread of life throughout the galaxy. Acting as the spreaders of life we will truly make up for the negative effects we have caused on our planet. We as a species are destined to protect, continue and spread life in a way no other known species could ever come close to doing.

There are some decent ""low gluten"" beers out there, such as Omission, Brunehaut, Stubbe pilsner, and to a lesser extent Estrella Damm. Due to an FDA ruling about a year ago or so ago, ""no beer made with gluten ingredients, even with gluten filtered out can be labeled as GF."" That wording is mine, but you get the drift.  Those are decent to good, but should not be consumed by those with Celiac.  That pretty much leaves the sorghum based , um, ""beer"". The less said about  them the better. I keep hearing about new breweries like Harvester in Oregon who are doing interesting sounding things with ingredients such as chestnuts and sweet potatoes. Hmmm.

Although my goth period was about 20 years ago, I was going through a rough time and I wanted to WHINE about it. I wanted to tell all of you how I was depressed. How following my husband to Seattle and leaving a company (HubSpot) and job I absolutely adored had screwed over my life. How my poor husband felt bad for messing with my career, and how I was soooooooooooooo unhappy.

Thankfully, I didn’t win the lottery at that point. In fact, this has come at a funny time – I was indeed lost, but I seem to have found myself. And I found myself just last week.

See, my dream job has always been to be COO of a small to mid-sized company. I have an odd fondness for the blood and guts of a company, and a good personality for #2. This is what I thought I lost.

I thought I lost my path to my dream job because I’d left my original career path (running IT at law firms) to go to consulting/marketing. And here I am, at a Big Company in Seattle, getting, well, bored with marketing.

Last week, though, after soul-searching, thinking, and praying, I realized something pretty darn amazing – I’m not lost. In fact, I never was.

Let’s face it: you can’t go directly from IT to operations. At least, not easily. And my MBA wasn’t filling all the gaps. What has filled the gaps, however, is this crazy sales and marketing thing. Even—no, especially—at the Big Company I work for in Seattle.

This doesn’t mean that I’m going to change jobs immediately, but it means that I’ve found my purpose again. I’m not off track, I’m not lonely, and my husband doesn’t have to feel guilty. I know that I want my next job to transition over to operations and that I want to manage people, but I can wait and find the RIGHT job.

I wish that, when I was depressed, I had realized that I wasn’t off the path. I wish that I had understood that the path was just a heck of a lot more twisty than I anticipated.

I’d love to hear about other twisting paths. Oh, and if you’d like to read less whiny writing of mine, you can find me by searching for ""Jenn Steele leading geeks"".

Last August, I moved from DC to Australia for graduate school. In that time my father got very sick. I returned home and stayed by his side during his miraculous recovery (seriously, the doctors were even shocked). He was discharged and went home on a path to full recovery and I returned to school in Australia.  Late one night, I got a phone call from my cousin telling me that my dad's condition had unexpectedly taken a drastic turn for the worse and he didnt have much time left. So ten thousand miles apart and over speaker phone, I had to say my last words to my father. He passed minutes later. 

I'm telling this to 20K+ strangers because since he passed I have felt scared and alone and apprehensive about the future. And I know I cant be the only one going through this.

I had never lost anyone before and my father was always the quiet reassurance I needed to keep me going. Losing him was like losing air.  

So while re-learning to breathe, I am learning a lot about myself. I want to share some thoughts with anyone out there who is grieving:

You dont have to find beauty in every moment. Some days suck. You are allowed to cry and be upset. Don't let anyone take that from you. Question your deity, question your purpose in life. Scream to the sky and sink to the abyss of sorrow. Do whatever it takes to make it through that second, minute, hour or day. Congratulate yourself for small milestones.

May 2013,12,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/05/12/just-walk-on-by/,"May 2013, 12",Just walk on by,"In 1962, my dad and a buddy from their military base at Twentynine Palms, were enjoying the live music of Leroy Van Dyke at a bar in San Bernardino, California. They ended up leaving with a gal my dad had been dancing with. On the way to her house, she informed him that she was presently going with the Vice President of the local chapter of a renowned motorcycle gang.

My dad's buddy dropped them off at her house and took off. The house door would only open a few inches before it hit something. The gal explained that it was her guy's motorcycle. My dad was not only full of regular courage, because he was one tough marine, but also had a bit of liquid courage on this night. So he pushed extra hard on the door and shot that motorcycle across the floor. 

This ruckus brought out the irate motorcycle owner, who I shall further refer to as H.A. Somehow, my dad just ends up conversing with H.A. until he goes back to bed. My dad and his new gal friend stay up a bit later until my dad passes out.

The next morning, my dad was awakened by the sound of a motorcycle circling the house. During a brief conversation with a child who ends up kicking him in a painful area, the sound of the motorcycle fades as H.A. presumably rides off to gather more members of his gang. Thankfully, my dad's buddy shows up at this time and gets my dad out of there.

A week or two later, as my dad was walking down a San Bernardino street, the gal hollers to my dad from a parked car. He could see she had a broken arm and had been badly beaten. She warns him to steer clear for a while.

Sometime after this my dad takes her away for a day in the hills.

I wanted to share one of the many wild events of my dad's life as mine seems so sedate in comparison. I confessed to him though that I am quite happy with my ""boring"" life, as I'm certainly not as tough or lucky to survive all he has.

Lastly, here are some tidbits about me...

I have great love and fierce loyalty to 8 people. These would be the members of my immediate family.

I increasingly enjoy the rich culture of the South, but am thankful for the Midwest upbringing I received in rural Iowa.

I first thought to give you some tips to live happily, but I do not think I have the authority to give advice on this topic... I am not yet thirty years old and do not know much about life. I also considered making a list of amazing facts that would have educated you and/or surprised you. But the web is full of such lists, so I abandoned the idea... Finally, I decided to offer you to make a discovery that will perhaps please you. It is about my mother’s work.

My mother is a painter. Eager to understand what painting is - a discipline that she has practised from her earliest years -, she took a degree in philosophy during which she became fascinated by the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty (a French philosopher), which would leave a deep mark on her pictorial work. Her life is made of constant interferences between painting and philosophy, the latter of which she teaches. They are like the two sides of a same approach.

For more than ten years, she has painted nothing but folds, out of fascination for their beauty. She paints folds, but she does not intend to ""represent"" them. The total lack of weariness and the passion with which she goes on painting them lead her to believe tha,t for her, the fold has become a language with an endless capacity to signify.

I am touched by the beauty of her works, and I am happy to share this beauty with all of you. I invite you warmly to discover her works on her website, that you will find with a simple Google search with ""Chariot-Dayez"" terms. Feel free to contact her to tell her what you think!

I wish you a happy and meaningful life. All the best,

Who pissed you off at work? What kind of smoothie did you choose? What did the asshole ahead of you at Starbucks order? How beautiful did she look in that sweater? Think of this as a time to reflect on the things that are happening both around, and inside of you - your own, free, thirty-second therapy session.

Hopefully through your reflection, and my exposure to your stories, you and I can both become a little more enlightened about this whole ""life"" thing.

For the sake of continuity, it would be really great if everyone started their message with the words ""Hi Tim."" I'm hoping to use these recordings for a project in the future.

I'm 24 years old and this week is the court date to finalize my divorce. I'd been with the same woman for my entire adult life - we started dating when we were 15. I loved - still love - her madly.

I graduated last year already set up in a good job. We bought a small, pretty house about an hour from our families, close to my work. We got Ikea furniture and a new roof and were saving for a new car and a dog.

Then she fell out of love with me, and left.

Six months ago I was happy, well adjusted, hard working. I knew what I wanted out of life and I had a pretty good idea how to get it. Now I feel like a gutted ship - I look mostly the same and I still float, but I'm empty and drifting. My house reflects this - pictures conspicuously missing, walls abandoned halfway through painting, far too much room for the tiny fragment of life that happens there. There are moving boxes that I'll take to Goodwill before I have the courage to open them. There's a room I can't enter without crying. My soon to be ex sister in law wrote ""Can't wait for all the memories we'll make here"" in our housewarming party guestbook. 

The source of so much of my strength is gone, at the time I need it most. I know I have to rebuild myself, become a complete person alone. Eventually I will.

In the meantime, this fucking sucks. I want my wife, my love, my life back.

May 2013,07,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/05/07/hello-world/,"May 2013, 07","Hello, world!","I thought maybe I'd write about shifting from a humanities education and editorial career to the world of technologists and a re-education, and career, in engineering.

I thought that, since this group is interested in correspondence, maybe I'd write about my decision, after twenty-five years, that cursive handwriting might be worth my time after all. (It turns out that, despite the frisson of opening the mailbox to receive a real, paper letter, a letter-writing hobby demands time and a special dedication in the era of email.)

But no, I'm going to write about childbirth. Not something I've ever done. Nor will I, since I'm a man.

The first time my wife went into labor, neither of us really knew what to expect. That's true for all first-time parents. We did know that the common Hollywood depiction of labor, with its dramatic screaming mom and bumbling dad was at best a gross stereotype and, at least in many cases, far from accurate.

We knew that we should call our midwife when contractions came with a certain frequency, and we did. They were very frequent, in fact, coming every 2-3 minutes. But they were weak contractions, nothing like the full-scale occupations of mind and body you might read about while preparing for your first child. Still, our midwife suggested we come to her clinic, and we did.

And we waited. The contractions came and went, came and went. We slept, or tried to. It was thirty-six hours at least before my wife felt a ~real~ contraction. The wait was annoying in some respects, but given our caring midwife, deeply respectful of the natural birth process, we were allowed to hang out comfortably, look after one another, and wait for the Real Thing.

The moaning began. I have mixed thoughts on a lot of the ""woo"" you see in discourse about this kind of stuff. When it comes down to it, one of the more amazing and wonderful things about natural childbirth is that it simply ""is what it is."" Bodies do what they have evolved and developed to do, and then there is a new sweet baby in the world.

But my wife experienced some intense and wonderful visions at this stage, leading up to Transition (the intense point where a woman shifts from cervical dilation to actually pushing out the baby). We like to interpret these visions as an experience of her body welcoming a new consciousness into the baby's body, and into the world. But, hey.

One of the great things about working with a midwife was the closeness and involvement I was privileged to experience as a father. I could be there, on the bed, offering support and encouragement as needed, and looking out for my wife's interests. All with her consent, of course.

That was autumn of 2010. Our second child was born earlier this year, and while the arrangements and preparation were very similar, the experience was much different.

We knew what to expect, for one thing. And, as many women attest, there is a huge boost in confidence and trust in one's own body going into a second labor. In a sense, it helps just to know It can be done.

It was fast. We arrived at the clinic at around 11:30 that evening. Our daughter was with us under three hours later. None of this fancy visionary stuff. I don't think she even laid on the bed the whole time we were there; she just dropped the baby into the midwife's arms as I massaged her shoulders.

Not for everyone, but to me...amazing.

I don't want to say too much about Ponda as I feel the story says it all, but I would like people to hear this story because I am intrigued astohow people interpret it.

Before you read Ponda:

I must mention Peter Fellows, who found the words to tell Ponda in a way I couldn't.Also to encourage you to email me your ideas and thoughts once you have finished reading.And finally, to thank The Listserve for giving me the opportunity to tell the tale of Ponda to so many people. I honestly am so grateful.

                        Tales of Ponda: Ponda           Story by Rikki Udagawa, Words by Peter Fellows

A curious young girl, Ponda often felt, she was being followed by something else. A darker presence, in the corner of her eye, a crooked hand reaching out, but just out of sight.One winter noon, she ventured, down a dusty road, where she met a withered old man who sensed her forebode. With crusty eyes and wrinkled mouth, he frowned as she described the dark presence, following her around. She didn’t bear to face what might be there, just too frightened to turn and face its glare.With a smile he sighed, and said ‘Although you’re afraid, my dear, you must face up to this presence, and recognize your fear. Life must go on’. Considering his wise words, Ponda thanked him and travelled on. Before long, she felt it there, sneaking up behind her, breathing in her hair. With terrified eyes, Ponda turned with all her strength, saw grimy fingers appear from nowhere, snatching at her, taunting her, binding together; a body appeared from the depths, a cloaked figure, the one called ‘Death!’Ponda couldn’t believe her eyes. She wanted to scream, but tears were all she could find. She begged for more time, promising any life mistakes would be set right.Gently taking her hand in his, she felt all fear simultaneously dismiss. With tender voice, and wanting tone, he told her ‘I’m just tired of being alone. I’ve fallen in love with you Ponda, and I wanted you to know. Your commitment to me would mean a life in darkness. I’d care and love you. We’d be eternity’s partners. You’d sit upon life’s throne’.Recognising loneliness, Ponda promised that she would. But not until she’d reached a ripe old age, and lived her life as she should.Promising to leave her, until that fateful day, Death let go of her hand, and disappeared from whence he came.Several years passed quickly, for Ponda now felt safe. She no longer felt the presence, the fear of being chased. Until, one morning she entered, a forest ripe with growth, where she once again felt tingling, and knew she’d been followed.Turning, no fear present, she witnessed death’s gritty hands, reach around her shoulders, and pull her to the ground. Her soul was released to the air, from beneath the woodland soil, Death grasping her body close, no remnants to tell her toil.Perhaps death was angry, or his love was just so strong, he couldn’t bear for them to be apart, not for so long. Or possibly, her time to die, had finally arrived for Ponda. It’ll never be known, which is the truth, and that is something to ponder…

                        The End.

This is a crazy time in my life and, frankly, also one of the loneliest. So, the opportunity to say something to 21k fellow listservers is somewhat poignant. I'm struck by a serious loss for words. Many of you have likely just sat down at the office and are looking  for an opportunity to delay actually starting work for the day and, if you're like me, many of you won't open half of these anyway.

So, for lack of any pithy words of advice or meaningful segments of literature, I'll tell you some interesting facts about Minnesota, the best state ever. It's where I grew up and really the only thing I can talk about off the top of my head and I think everyone can relate to having hometown pride. Especially in this city full of implants. 

1. Prince lives/records there. 2. Though it's called the land of 10k lakes, there's over 12,000, but we're a humble folk. 3. Minneapolis was ranked both most bike-friendly and most hipster. so take a walk portland and seattle. 4. f. scott fitzgerald is from there5. josh hartnett6. the incredible music stylings of atmosphere, cloud cult, motion city soundtrack, trampled by turtles, dessa, etc.7. honeycrisp apples were invented there8. We actually do things in the winter because we don't fear the cold.9. Lindsey Vonn trained in Minnesota, right outside the twin cities. 

I'll leave you with one of the more touching things I ever heard. On her birthday, my philosophy professor in India was gushing about how loved she felt and tearfully said something to the extent of ""the most precious thing you can have is people around you."" 

I really apologize for this scatterbrained post. I hope you can relate to this snapshot into my version of the human experience.

May 2013,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/05/04/kid-wisdom/,"May 2013, 04",Kid Wisdom,"Hello Listserve friends,

I am currently finishing my first year teaching.  I teach English Language Arts to 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at a small school in rural Vermont.  So many people have told me I'm crazy for choosing to spend my days with middle school kids, and while I often laugh off those comments, I can't say I always disagree.  Occasionally I have days where I want to bang my head against something (I've only indulged in this desire once!), but most of my days are actually filled with laughter and learning; and it's not just my students who are learning.  They may be young, but my students know levels of tragedy and joy that I can only imagine.  They teach me more than they will ever know.   We see plenty of advice pour into our inboxes via The Listserve, but instead of rattling off what little I know of the world, I decided to ask my students to inspire you with their best pieces of advice, since they are my daily inspiration.  Here are some of the highlights...

Words of wisdom from kids (ages 10-14):

*Always wear socks*Never let anyone take over your dreams*Don't eat yellow snow (and if you find something brown on the ground, it's probably not chocolate)*When people are nice to you, be nice back. It's like someone giving you a present and you giving one back.*Life will be a lot easier if you mind your own business*Never try to ride a shopping cart down a hill*Don't be mouthy to your parents*Pie makes everything better*Go outside and do something with your life*Keep calm; life goes on*Mountains will crumble, oceans will freeze over, and whole cities will be destroyed if you are late for math class*Never take a good friend for granted*Never leave the empty milk carton in the fridge*If you ever love two people, go with the second one because if you really loved the first one, you wouldn't have fallen in love again*You don't need to use two sheets of toilet paperc just because it's etiquette or fancy; use what get the job done (that also applies to relationships and life choices... but mostly toilet paper)

May 2013,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/05/03/luck/,"May 2013, 03",Luck,"Do you believe in karma ? Well I do believe in balance. Like a physics law that states that everything tend to reach balance. Same thing with ""luck"". Sometimes you are lucky, sometime you are not... and it sort of balance out.  So, at the end, the important thing is what remains and this will be what you have focused on. Remember the luck you have and try to neglect your misfortune.

Ok, that was for the ""I'm trying to be wise part"".

Now, because I probably used 2 years of ""good luck"" karma to be chosen among 10K+ people to write to you, I'll better try to make it useful in some way.

Hmm. Well, one very little thing, as a cyclist, that I always wanted to tell the world is : Dear car/truck driver, but please don't treat us as an obstacle on the road and if you're about to overtake, do it properly, like you would overtake -lets say.. hmm- a police car ! Because in the process, you may risk precious time, but we risk life.

Another thing I would like to share is that suspicion is in my point of you one of the worst evil on this planet. So please, do me a favour today : turn one suspicious thought about someone or something into trust and see where it goes. Ok, you may hit a wall, but you'll enjoy the way to it. Otherwise you may not hit the wall, but what's the point if you spent all your time worrying. At the end, we all die (and hit the wall).

That was ""I'm trying to be wise part 2"". And that was unexpected. You know, It's pretty hard to realize that you have a probably unique chance to address so many people and in the same time not to waste it.

I'll better end it now. Just know that I was happy to talk to you, people from earth, masters of the universe, top of the food chain, completely responsible for what is happening -or not- to our planet. (Yep, part 3)

Have a good day !

May 2013,02,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/05/02/how-i-became-a-nude-photographer/,"May 2013, 02",How I became a nude photographer,"Hello!

I'm Alex and I'm a freelance web developer/consultant - a combination of telling people what to do on the internet & actually doing it. But today I'm going to talk to you about how I became a nude photographer.

Over the years I've smeared people with blackberries and stuck pinheads & glowsticks to them. I've made human-sized cat cones and played with fire. There was a brief time when it seemed likely I'd become a professional pornographer. I've watched a friend get her lips sewn shut and then pose in a dank basement with a giant python - that one was her idea. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

I've always been interested in photography but it wasn't until my second year of university that my passion ignited. I was trying to impress a lady by teaching her to use a manual SLR. She remained unwooed, but I found a new way to express myself. I wanted to learn as much as possible, so I read voraciously and tried what I could. But one genre seemed out of reach: nudes.

I had no idea where to start. How do you find a model? How do you convince them that you're an artist, not a pervert? How do you find suitable locations? How do you direct them during the shoot? Where do you get your film developed? How do you make an image about tone and form and beauty, not just a random naked person feeling awkward?

One day I was talking about this problem with a friend. She told me she'd done life modelling before; she'd be happy to model. Really? I've never done this before; I'm going to suck. She didn't care. We made plans, did a shoot, and I made some mediocre photos. But it was catalyst enough: friends heard about it and volunteered to model too. My photos and ideas improved. I got better at inviting strangers to model. I'm still baffled and grateful for people's willingness to shed their clothes for art. It's a deeply trusting thing to do, and I never want to abuse that trust.

A lot of people think of nude photography as a sexual thing. Sometimes there's a remnant of eroticism on a shoot, but not often. The best metaphor I have: have you ever made someone a sandwich when you're not hungry? You'll still find your mouth watering a little; it's Pavlovian. Now imagine it's a *really* complicated sandwich, and everyone will judge you on it. You've got to position the ingredients perfectly. The colour of the lettuce must complement the tomatoes. The condiments are trusting you, you're considering better meats to use as you work, and you've got to reassure the bread without seeming creepy... this metaphor's got a bit weird. But the point is there's a lot of factors at play and nobody's there for sex, so you don't have the brain cycles free to get distracted. Or at least I don't.

Photography's all theatre. Photography's a magic trick. It's about making constructed situations seem natural. The viewer shouldn't see the hours of planning and setup and props and lighting that went into it. The viewer should see the end result, fully formed, and have no idea how it was done. There was nothing, then suddenly: an image. That's as true for nudes as for any other genre. That's what I'm aiming for.

You can follow me on twitter at @acreature, or see my photos on my website. I'm not allowed to include a link but I'm easy to Google. And if you'd like to model: email me.

I think that if I were a book, I'd be a bulky hardcover who's publisher never bothered with the flashy dust-jacket. I'd be quarter-bound- of soft blue and brown linen, with a shiny silver gilded title- just a tiny touch of elegance here and there. I'd be that unassuming tome in the corner, patient and polite with all those who's hands merely skim over me on the shelf. For those who open the book and dive in (because after all, a hardcover without a dust-jacket lacks an easily accessible synopsis), they find themselves drawn into a story absolutely overflowing with footnotes and parenthesis and made up words and italics. 

They'll find tales that will remind them of Orwell's time in Paris, poorly written poems, romantic tales of prancing steeds and courageous dogs, and all sorts of things that incite raucous laughter. My book would tell tales of life in a large family, of sun-riped blueberries still on the bush, of the sorts of trouble a young lady can find herself in in small-town america, of the smell of baking bread, and of the the things one's capable of when one realizes you can make a difference in this world. It would be profane. It would be heart-wrenching. It would be filled with words of encouragement and self-deprecation and revelations about life and death. 

The corners of my binding would be smashed from being dropped. As you turn the pages, you'll come across pressed flowers and pretty leaves tucked away to save for a rainy day. The flowers will have stained the surrounding pages, their color bleeding out into the paper. There are all sorts of notations- underlined, circled, occasionally with comments scribbled in the margins, but more often than not, there's little to no explanation, because either there's no need to explain or no way to explain.

It is a shame that that the most dominating College Football state of the past 4 years hasn’t been represented yet. (3 Championships from Alabama, 1 from Auburn).

I’ve got to admit, moving back to the state I grew up in on the verge the Crimson Tide’s collegiate dominance couldn’t have been any better timed.

After staying a true fan through a decade+ of up and down seasons (mostly down) it is nice to be on top again.

Late last year I purchased a 1934 Ford Coupe fiberglass project car.

I’m really excited to be working on something like this, even though I don’t really know what I’m doing.Luckily for me my father-in-law does.  If any of you have tips on previous hot rod projects you’ve worked on I’d love to hear them.If you’re interested in selling some hot rod parts, I may be interested in those too!

I work in IT at one of the top 5 largest U.S. colleges based on enrollment.

I really enjoy my job as a Data Analyst and I love having the ability to sift through millions of records of apparent random data and know what to do to turn it into powerful information.

Then, being able to see that information used to drive meaningful decisions to help the university move towards their strategic goals is an even bigger bonus!

One thing I’ve learned dealing with large amounts of data is that there are almost always exceptions to the rule.

Everyone may think that a certain scenario couldn’t or shouldn’t happen but until you look at the data, you don’t know for sure.

I feel this has also made me a skeptic in real life too though. I find myself committing to fewer statements until I have definitive proof that I’m picking the right option.

I don’t know if this makes me a good worker, a super nerd, or a boring person with no hobbies (before I bought my car) but if I’ve got nothing to do one night I like being able to work on fun projects from work outside of normal business hours without the constant interruptions of email and instant messages slowing me down. I feel so much more productive.  Working full-time from home has also enlightened me to the amount of wasted time I had when I worked in an office setting going to and from meetings and constantly being pulled into side-conversations as people come in and out of the office.  I do miss the personal interaction though.

In 2011 my wife and I had our first child and it really is amazing how kids change your perspective on life.  I’m still a huge Alabama fan, technology nerd, and aspiring hot-rodder, but none of that really matters when compared to being able to spend quality time with your family.  I hate when I realize that I’ve let something distract me and take away time I should have spent with them.  As kids become toddlers and really start learning, it is amazing watching them pick up on new things.  No one can make me truly laugh like my little girl can and nothing makes me prouder when she learns something new (especially if I taught her!).

If you want to check out the perspective of raising a kid from a father’s viewpoint check out my brother-in-law’s blog by googling “dadabase blogger”.

In the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And an outstanding reason for choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship - be it JC or Allah, be it Yahweh or the Wiccan mother-goddess or the Four Noble Truths or some infrangible set of ethical principles - is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive. If you worship money and things - if they are where you tap real meaning in life - then you will never have enough. Never feel you have enough. It's the truth. Worship your own body and beauty and sexual allure and you will always feel ugly, and when time and age start showing, you will die a million deaths before they finally plant you. On one level, we all know this stuff already - it's been codified as myths, proverbs, clichés, bromides, epigrams, parables: the skeleton of every great story. The trick is keeping the truth up front in daily consciousness. Worship power - you will feel weak and afraid, and you will need ever more power over others to keep the fear at bay. Worship your intellect, being seen as smart - you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud, always on the verge of being found out.

The insidious thing about these forms of worship is not that they're evil or sinful; it is that they are unconscious. They are default settings. And the world will not discourage you from operating on your default settings, because the world of men and money and power hums along quite nicely on the fuel of fear and contempt and frustration and craving and the worship of self. Our own present culture has harnessed these forces in ways that have yielded extraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The freedom to be lords of our own tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the centre of all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most precious you will not hear much talked about in the great outside world of winning and achieving and displaying. The really important kind of freedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them, over and over, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day. That is real freedom. The alternative is unconsciousness, the default setting, the ""rat race"" - the constant gnawing sense of having had and lost some infinite thing.

I know that this stuff probably doesn't sound fun and breezy or grandly inspirational. What it is, so far as I can see, is the truth with a whole lot of rhetorical bullshit pared away. Obviously, you can think of it whatever you wish. But please don't dismiss it as some finger-wagging Dr Laura sermon. None of this is about morality, or religion, or dogma, or big fancy questions of life after death. The capital-T Truth is about life before death. It is about making it to 30, or maybe 50, without wanting to shoot yourself in the head. It is about simple awareness - awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, that we have to keep reminding ourselves, over and over: ""This is water, this is water.""

April 2013,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/04/24/greetings-from-bosnia-herzegovina/,"April 2013, 24",Greetings from Bosnia Herzegovina,"Hi there,

My name is Mirza. I am from Bosnia Herzegovina. Just like many others on ListServe, I was both excited and mortified when I received the ""You've been selected"" email from ListServe. What can I say to 20,000+ people? What should I write? How will my email compare to others that came before me? I pondered this question for a while before finally deciding to share 10 things about my country (in no particular order) that you might not know.

1. ""World War I"" broke out as a consequence of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, being shot dead in Sarajevo (capital of Bosnia), by Gavrilo Princip, one of a group of six Bosnian Serb assassins.

2. The 1984 Winter Olympics, the XIV Olympic Winter Games, were held in Sarajevo, present-day Bosnia-Herzegovina.

3. One of the last remaining rain-forests (primeval forests) in Europe is located in Bosnia-Herzegovina, near the border with Montenegro.

4. Bosnia-Herzegovina boasts at least two Noble Prize Laureates in Ivo Andrić (1961 - Literature) and Vladimir Prelog (1975 Chemistry).

5. Bosnian writer and director Danis Tanovic won an Oscar in 2002 for best foreign film: ""No Man’s Land"".

6. The Sarajevo Film Festival, an annual film festival held every August in Sarajevo, is one of the largest film festivals in Europe. Founded in 1995 during the siege of Sarajevo, it has brought international and local celebrities to the Bosnian capital every year since.

7. One of the country's most recognizable landmarks, Stari Most (Old Bridge), is a bridge built in the 16th century by the Ottomans in the city of Mostar. The Old Bridge stood for 427 years, before it was destroyed on 9 November 1993 by Bosnian Croat forces. The bridge was rebuilt and reopened on 23 July 2004. It is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

8. IrfanView, one of the most popular free image/graphic viewers, was created in 1996 by Bosnian Irfan Skiljan.

9. Despite its relatively small population (approximately 3,750,000), Bosnia Herzegovina boasts a number of past and present world recognized sportspeople. Edin Dzeko (Football - Manchester City), Mirza Teletovic (Basketball - Brooklyn Nets), Felix Sturm aka Adnan Catic (Boxing), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Football - PSG), Mirza Delibasic (Basketball - former Bosnia and Real Madrid), Hasan Salihamidzic (Football - former Bosnia and Bayern Munich) all are of Bosnian descent.

10. Since 2005, a number of people have visited Bosnia to see the ""Bosnian Pyramids"", a cluster of geological formations known as flatirons near the Bosnian town of Visoko, northwest of Sarajevo.The pyramid shaped hills are promoted by Bosnian author Semir Osmanagic as human-made and the largest ancient pyramids on Earth.

One concept that I really love is about freedom.

""Freedom is not just the ability to do what you will (what you wish or want) but to be able to will, with nothing but pure reason""

We always think about freedom in terms of what we *can* do. A bigger question is, if no body stops us, what will we do? And why? Think about it.

April 2013,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/04/22/perspective-possibility-and-play/,"April 2013, 22","perspective, possibility and play","This past year, I've been thinking a lot about how we cultivate and maintain sense of the possible in the face of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.

It was a year of great contrasts, that found me in places I did not expect, doing things I did not expect to be doing. Surprise and delight nourished my belief that we can work for the better. But there were also doubts of depression. Possibility and clarity were overcome by pessismism and uncertainty.

 * * * * *

   «Surprise in infinite play is the triumph of the future of the past.     Since infinite players do not regard the past as having an outcome,     they have no way of knowing what has begun there. With each surprise,     the past reveals a new beginning in itself.»

Again and again, I return to Finite and Infinite Games. Though short, it resists summarization. It eschews rigid precepts, but has influenced me greatly. It's about playing over winning, the game over the players, possibility over certainty, strength over power, about transcending the past for the sake of the future. I buy copies to give away.

   «A finite game is played for the purpose of wining, an infinite game for     the purpose of continuing the play.»

  * * * * *

I didn't know Aaron Swartz well, but I'm close to many of his closest. I live with some of them in an apartment that was once his. His death was felt keenly in our community, and it came at a low time in my own life. I identified with his struggle with despair. But I was also struck that someone who I had admired for engaging creatively with the world, who has unique insight to problems and forged paths where others saw none, had succumbed to hopelessness. He had a hacker playfulness, an aptitute for playing with the rules and not merely within them. Aaron's remarkable hubris and sense of the possible had failed him.

He reminded me of another amazing tech activist friend who died six years ago. Chris Lightfoot was also somone who delighted in throwing himself at the problems of the world, and who often made dents in them. He too killed himself. We still miss him. Both left behind them a sense that the work they put down was work which we must take up. That their shoes are big, but that we must try to fill them.

Since his death, a few of Aaron's posts in particular have resonated with me. On Productivity is incisive on the quality of our time. Theory of Change engage with the question of how we hope to make a difference. How to Save a Life encourages us to raise our expectations for what we can achieve. Together, they speak to Aaron's way of viewing and addressing the world.

 * * * * *

It's easy to succumb to a rigid view of how things work, to underestimate our capabilities, to forget that we can be surprised, that we can surprise ourselves. There are many zero-sum games in the world, but the world is not a zero-sum game. We must perpetually struggle to transcend finite games for the infinite one.

This week was a week of contrasts. I was astonished and delighted to find myself starting a company. But it was a week in which my adopted city saw much sadness. The MIT police officer who was killed was part of my community too. I can't help but worry that this is the just the beginning of a new chapter in the sorry story of the past ten years.

How do you maintain perspective, possibility and play?

I am thankful to have a job, at all.  I do have friends who can't get one.  I just feel unfulfilled.  I realize that it is a rarity to get the job you want, just a couple of years out of college, but that doesn't stop me from wanting more.  I've been looking, and making things happen.  Interviews, second interviews, tests, references, getting so close, but not reaching the next level, yet.  With the support of my friends and family, I've been able to keep my head up, and keep pushing.  But, I know that there are thousands of others, just like me, and I'm wondering what the situation is doing to them, to us, and a group.  This ""Millenial"" generation is participating in the lowest level of new home formation (moving out of mom and dad's, into your own place), since the 1950s, which says a lot of different things, at once.      These are all ideas, and stories all of you have read about, in the newspaper, and heard from your own friends, or gone through, yourselves.  What I'm wondering is what will be the lasting effect?  I'm thinking one of two things.  Either we'll let this seep into or permanent mindset, and continue feeling like we can't live up to the achievements and expectations set by those generations who have come before us, never feeling like we've reached our potential.  The other result might be that we are still afraid of the greatness we may achieve, and this odd waiting period will only serve to make us stronger.  Giving us a sense of perseverance that will continue to serve us throughout our lives.  Toughening us up.  A last bit if harsh winter, before the Spring of our lives gives us the chance to thrive grow, and create for ourselves, and those to follow.  Shaping the world in our own image.     I'm thinking the latter version will prove to be the eventual course for myself, and most of my peers, and we'll get our time to show what we are made of.  But, of course, it's possible that I'm going through the same thing that countless generations before me have felt and experienced, and everything will turn out just fine.

The train started to move and I looked back again to see that still, no one was with him. He was riding the train alone. Later he pulled out a string cheese snack and with great intent pealed a little strand down to the bottom but not all the way off, so that it was hanging there, dangling. He preceded repeat this until the snack was now transformed into a dangling squid which he bounced around in the air as if acting out some skit. Every time I eat string cheese since seeing this boy alone on the train I go through the same motions of transforming my snack into a squid and while doing so I think about that little boy. I like to think he was running away, starting a life free of the structure of family, school, society… I will always see myself as that little boy, a kid running away from the world with just his imagination to keep him company.

I have experienced a huge amount in the past year. I have no doubt in my mind that it began when I started to believe in myself. I truly believe now that you create your own luck and that it all begins with your mental state.

Imagine wearing a small stylish piece of technology on your head that can record your mental state throughout the day: happy, depressed, frustrated, engaged, etc. Now imagine at the end of each day you could search for the happiest moment you experienced and re-live it by playing back the point of view video that the same device captured. Imagine your doctor has diagnosed you with clinical depression and you are able to search through your mental state data for the moments you experienced the most depression and view the video of the minutes prior to determine factors that could be triggering this. Imagine using EEG to interface with heads up display technology like Google Glass and you will be imagining my dream of the technology I hope to bring to the world. I will be spending my summer in the Orlando, Florida area developing EEG and Eye Tracking software for a company looking to break into the NeuroMarketing field. My first steps towards realizing this dream.

Stephen Swartz has been a friend of mine since high school and I have not since met anyone with more pure talent than himself. We studied percussion together and I was consistently blown away by his musical prowess on any instrument as well as his improvisational creativity. In this day and age when it seems like we are being overwhelmed with new music from laptop producers, I believe it is my duty as someone involved in the music industry to search for and recognize those artists who are putting their heart and soul into their work. Stephen is one of those artists. Google Stephen Swartz Bullet Train and you will see for yourself. Enjoy.

I am always looking to connect with people and learn more so please feel free to reach out to me. If you are in the Orlando area this summer lets meet up and grab coffee! I would say a beer but I am still 20. ;)

April 2013,19,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/04/19/the-princesses-the-tooth-fairy/,"April 2013, 19",The Princesses & the Tooth Fairy!,"Years ago, when my daughter was five, I took her to a local Festival, an event that we never miss. She loves all the rides and games. I am a soft touch when it comes to my daughter, and she knows it.

One attraction offered at this event was a bungee/trampoline combo that looked as if it would be great fun. Picture a bungee harness attached to cables, and an electric hoist supported by a framework of steel that rose about twenty feet in the air. Below this was a small air-filled trampoline about six feet in diameter and two feet high. My Princess had to experience this! I purchased a ticket and off went my little angel. The nice lady strapped her in and my daughter began bouncing on the trampoline, the bungee cables keeping her centered and allowing her to go high up in the air. So far, so good. The nice lady who had strapped my daughter in gave me a big smile — correction, a big toothless smile!

Then it hit me. I had entrusted the life of all I hold precious to someone who could not even take care of her own teeth! What was I thinking? As my daughter continued to bounce gleefully up and down, I took mental notes of the apparatus, trying to determine the weak spots. Where would it break? In what direction will my daughter be sailing through the air? I made my best guess and moved into an area where I felt it would only be a matter of time before I would be rescuing my daughter like Superman. Why has fatherhood turned me into such a neurotic? A few more bounces and then they raised her up to the top of the unit. Annabella was now suspended about twenty feet in the air. If something broke, she would shoot straight up in the air like a human bottle rocket!

The nice lady pushed a button, and my daughter slowly descended, the harness was removed and off we went, my daughter fearless and elated, and dad needing a Xanax.

Then we played a game of tossing ping-pong balls into bowls floating in a pool. I’d like to meet the cruel genius who invented this game. Twenty dollars later, we won a fish in a plastic bag. When I arrived home, my wife asked me if I would go buy a fish bowl with a cover (so the cats couldn’t get at the fish). I headed to the pet store, where I was informed that they did not have covers for their fish bowls. So they showed me an aquarium — a very small, cheap-looking aquarium that made the plastic bag seem like Buckingham Palace. So I looked at the better aquariums. One hour later, I left with a 29-gallon aquarium, a stand, a filter, a light, gravel, and so on.

After three more trips to the pet store, I’d spent about $400 on the aquarium and all of the necessary components to make our fish a happy fish. My daughter named the fish “Princess.” I called it “Princess Lucky.” After three days, we determined that the water was now suitable for Princess Lucky to enter the aquarium. Amid much fanfare, Princess Lucky was escorted to her new quarters. As she investigated her new digs, she looked very happy. And I could swear, at one point, she looked back at me and smiled…

…a big toothless smile!

I'm sorry to break this to you, in an e-mail from a random stranger like this, but it needs to be said: Most of your life won't be fantastic. I'm not joking. The adventures you'll tell your children about will be a minuscule part of it. So if you want to avoid the feeling of utter disappointment as you grow older, you need to accept that fact. Sorry.

This leads us to the insight: You should focus more on the non-fantastic parts. The parts where you eat breakfast, walk to the bus, have a boring day at work, eat your ordinary lunch, shop groceries, and brush your teeth. After all, this is the major part of your life, and neglecting it is a wasted opportunity.

Here's the thing: Most of the boring stuff in your life is so dull, that even the tiniest thing can make it seem fun. The tiniest thing. This means the you could make it better with extremely simple means.

What exactly am I talking about here? Little things. Like these:

* Challenges: When brushing your teeth tonight, use your left hand.* Mind games: When you enter work (or school!), imagine the sound ""Kabaaaam!"" as you enter, as if your presence changed the whole room.* Action: Jump down from the side-walk, instead of just stepping down.* Changes: Buy some fancy tomato sauce tonight, instead of your usual brand.* More action: Count the number of pink things on your way to work, as if your life depended on it.

See? Easy stuff. I really try to live by this ""Everyday Action"" idea, and I think it works for making the boring parts of life more fun. Because that's the thing: just because the fantastic moments are few, there's no reason to just sit there, waiting for the next big thing to swipe you off your feet. Have some fun meanwhile, it's easy...

April 2013,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/04/16/sonder/,"April 2013, 16",Sonder,"For those uninitiated, sonder is defined as follows: n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness.

A brief story set in New York.

Somehow, I got into my head that I must to move to a city. I wanted to lose myself beneath gigantic concrete, glass, and steel behemoths and in between millions of denizens. So, I packed a suitcase and went to New York, NY. Youthful anticipation is beautiful and naive. I had saved up enough capital for my rent and daily expenditures, and I had planned a sizeable list of things to do. I was bursting with excitement, I could not wait to live in the Big Apple!

On the third morning after my arrival, I left my apartment with a self-guided tour of the New School in mind. Fast forward to me heading down the yellow line near Prince street. There I was, sitting on some train car, underground, moving 30 mph, when four men approached me and asked for the time. As soon as I pulled out my phone, I was punched square in the jaw and I was knocked to the ground. The moment was surreal, absurd. I can remember seeing blood drip from my mouth to the ground, and I can remember looking for the others on the train. I wasn't looking for help-- I knew that wouldn't come. It was a disappointed, defeated gaze. I was drawn to my feet by one of the men, and, again, I was queried for the time. For a second time I moved for my phone; I read the numbers on the screen, 1:27 pm. They replied with a, ""Thank You,"" and exited at the next stop.

I forwent my trip to the New School and returned home where I immediately threw my list of activities in the trash. It was not going to be like this and I was not going to do that. Those men had taken my naivety, but in return they gave me time. From that point forward, I spent my time observing others and losing myself in my being.

The city was no longer a fairytale; it lied naked before me. It was a battleground and a playground. In five minutes on a subway I saw the worst of humanity, in the remainder of my trip I had prove that humans could be great as well. Weeks later, I met a future amazing friend in a bar that I frequented. We began talking mutual interests: film, music, travel, art, everything. We both happened to be frisbee fanatics so I suggested we throw some disk. We agreed and spent following at Bryant park making each other laugh.

With this, my story comes to a close. Humanity's beauty is usually not found in grandiose efforts of altruistic sacrifice. Though it does happen that way sometimes, it usually presents itself in the mundane. Two people, throwing a frisbee, on a small patch of green, lost in tangled metal. I am not imparting a philosophy of life or giving worthwhile advice. Understand that we live our individual lives and only you can decide how you will affect others.

April 2013,15,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/04/15/would-i-be-a-different-person-if-i-had-a-sibling/,"April 2013, 15",Would I Be A Different Person If I Had A Sibling?,"I won The ListServe Lottery, not on April Fool’s Day, but on National Sibling Day, as an only child.

I was born and raised in China, a country known for a lot of things, including the “one child policy.” More than half of the people started to ask about the “one child policy” right after they knew I was born in China.

Do you guys still have that policy?

Why did your country have that policy?

Does China really have a large population? How large is it?

But I heard that people still had more than one child, right?

Blah blah blah.

Yes, we did have that policy, because we did have and still have a large population. It’s very large.

It’s 1/5 of the world’s population.

Right now if two only child get married, they could have two kids.

Just two.

No more than two.

However, what I want to talk about today, isn’t that policy, but a question that has been lingering in my head — how different would I be, if I had a sibling or two?

Recently at work, we interviewed a lot of people for a project. A young women in her late twenties said that her little sister, who’s now nine-year-old, is like her baby before she has her own baby. She would tell her all the lessons that she’d learned in life to prevent her from making the same mistakes. And her biggest wish is for her little sister to grow into a happy and healthy young lady.

I was so moved. I never had that kind of feeling. I never loved anyone in this world unselfishly and unconditionally other than my mom and dad.

I never had a big sister who could have warned me not to fall for Mr. Wrong;

I never had a big brother who could have taught me how to pitch, how to dance, and how to explore the world;

I never had a little sister with whom I could have shared every little secret and every pretty dress;

I never had a little brother whom I’d call dumb and obnoxious all day long but be secretly proud of.

A “mean” friend of mine always says that because I’m the only child, I’m spoiled. I’m eager to win and I always want everything.

But I disagree. Because I was given everything growing up, I cannot care less about monetary things and thus find myself less competitive in a lot of situations.

I cannot prove he’s wrong, nor prove I’m right.

If I had a sibling…

Would I be tougher? Would I be stronger? Would I be kinder?

Would I be more considerate? Would I be more patient? Would I be more mature?

How would they shape me and help me become someone different and better?

I now live a Pacific away from my parents. If I had a sibling, would him or her move here to be closer to me? Would we be each other’s support?

I don’t know. And I will never know.

It’s not like, I’ve never had a true adventure so I’m ready to take a true adventure;

It’s not like, I’ve never fallen onto the cold, hard ground so I’m ready to take the biggest chance.

I could never go back in time and grow up once again with a sibling.

Don't be greedy with your love for your siblings, coz there are people longing to have one.

Even with this weird opportunity to send a message to 21,422 people, I’d rather just send you a birthday note. So, listen up:

You are f$%&ing awesome.

I know it’s been a pretty weird (weird = kind of crappy and also legitimately weird) year for you, but you’re less than a week away from a fresh start.

Last year you:

Took a paid sabbatical.Tried stand up comedy.Realized stand up comedy was not your jam and tried writing funny stuff instead.Wrote funny stuff.Helped a lot of vets.Stopped being a vegan.Became one of my best friends.

This year you will:

Realize that you are f$%&ing awesome.Try improv comedy.Tell someone exactly why he or she should hire you and believe it.Tell your dumb boss exactly what you think (at least once).Teach someone else how to be a great friend who does things like sending text messages at 8:25 AM on Monday mornings that say “Here’s to a good week!” even though you know it won’t be.Re-read Fierce Invalids and learn something new about Switters.

I know you will.

Let’s start with improv - first class on Daniel and me. We’re signing you up for Level One with Armando on April 27th. Happy Birthday!

Cheers to you, your big heart, your ridiculous giggle, your brave and lonely feminism, and your eerie way of knowing what’s right - always.

With my heart,

April 2013,12,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/04/12/moments-of-gratitude/,"April 2013, 12",Moments of Gratitude,"Last year I watched a TED talk about lollipops (go ahead and watch it) and the impact you can have one someone’s life without even knowing it. I’ve found that a lot of people, myself included, are pretty terrible at expressing gratitude, at letting people know how important they are or how they have helped you to grow. Maybe it’s because we don’t realize the effect they’ve had until long after the interaction.

As a part of my job, I organize a staff training program including a safety and security training. Among engaging powerpoints, indoor drills, and one pretty memorable outdoor activity, we also make sure that every person has had the hands on experience of using a fire extinguisher* - the idea is that you have to actually do something to feel comfortable doing it. I feel the same way about expressing gratitude, praise, feedback and more. You have to get in the practice of doing it – and the more you do – the more natural it is.

So I’ll it started – “Thank you”

To the family I was born to and have found over the years for inspiring me to do better, to learn more, to take risks, to trust, to explore.

To the friends I have lost touch with – there is a certain comfort in knowing that you pop in and out of my memories, that one day we’ll reconnect and it will be like no time has passed at all … or a great deal of time and still we’ll reminisce with joy.

To the friends I have lost for helping me to see how I’ve grown, where I’ve come from, teaching me to prioritize and make hard choices.

To my supervisors in work over the years for giving me so many opportunities to get better, experience different styles, learn, and develop over time. For trusting me.

To my mentors, assigned, found, stumbled upon (and those of you who just don’t know how much I look up to you) for taking the time to invest in me and my success – for learning from me and giving to me, for challenging and pushing, and helping me to fly.

To the people I’ve worked with in so many different jobs for collaboration, inspiration, funny videos, teaching your skills and making work seem like fun.

And to the people who have worked for me for helping me to grow, offering your knowledge and perspective, and understanding that we are all working with the best intentions.

This is vague – I know. I’ll try to be better at acknowledging these realizations as they occur. I only encourage you to do the same. Thank someone, tell them how they influenced you, how they changed you.

There were other things I imagined I would want to email to all of you about... they included:

The Little Prince (please read it... again)

Sarah Kay (amazing spoken word)

Travel (do it...it's good for the soul)

Cooking or recipes or something (but there's pinterest, right?)

Social Media, Networking, and Connections (It's a little overwhelming really)

Summer Camp (what an incredible experience for kids to learn how to be kids… good, independent, kind, adventurous, filled with wonder kids)

CHASING BLISS-----------------------

Someday some hypermanic kidwill produce a moronically maxed-out adventure odysseythat will spark the overdue rebellionamong all the over-pressured SAT grinds,and us grumpy midlife criticswill get to witness a new Kerouac,and the greatest pent-up young-life crisisin the history of the world.    - David Brooks, “Sal Paradise at 50,” NY Times, 2007

This is about a quest. An ordinary quest -- no dragons, sorcerers, mythical beasts. I wish. This is about my journey into the soul. Now I know what you're thinking. Not another egotistical self-absorbed desperate whiny journey into the soul.* Why would you want to read that? No. Like I said, this is about a quest.

Step one: Abandon >all< earthly possessions.

    Well, almost. I have a backpack. A light one, with no more than a few toiletries, sleeping bag, a few extra shirts.    And I have a boyfriend, whom I love almost as much as life itself. He’s not coming with me. I can’t even imagine life without him. He is Mr. Perfect in every sense of the word. His name is Michael. I could write a whole book about how much I love Michael. In fact, I did. It’s my diary. Not for publication.    Anyway, he is the reason why Step #2 is REALLY REALLY HARD!

Step two: Buy a 1-way ticket to the other side of the world.

Step #3: Go on the greatest adventure of your young life.

But before I get ahead of myself, like I said, this is about a quest. There is a back story. In order to appreciate the full meaning of the quest, you need to know the back story. If you would rather skip right to the adventure, see p. __ (How to talk your way out of paying police bribes in Nepal) or maybe p. __ (Sleeping through terrorist attacks outside your window). But trust me, you want the back story.

Like many young middle-class Americans, I went to college. I went to a good college, University of Washington.

No, wait. Back up. This whole mess started with the SAT. That fucking standardized test. During high school, I was convinced I was going to be an artist. I wanted to go to art school. But my parents, of course, wanted me to go to a respectable school and pursue a respectable career -- one that would actually make money.

Sound familiar?? Doesn’t every young person go through something like this???

So I took the SAT. And I got my score, like everyone else. But while everyone else was looking at their scores thinking “Fuck, I’ll never get into Harvard with a 1080!” I was looking at my score thinking someone vastly OVER-estimated my intelligence. Someone at the switch messed up. Pushed a button. Dropped a box full of files. Maybe some poor sorry 22 year-old at the SAT office never learned how to alphabetize, mixed up Sarah Ouderkirk with Sarah Actually-wants-to-go-to-college, or Sarah Grew-up-in-the-Ghetto-and-really-deserves-this-opportunity, or a BILLION other Sarahs ...

But there was no mistake. I was doomed. Cursed with an above-average SAT score, my  parents and everyone else expected me to go to college.

So I applied.

My name is Barboza, from a city in the southest part of Brazil. And unfortunately I dont have a touching history to share with you.

But I have some advices:

- Dont own, share:     In a few years, status will not be how much you own, but how much you can share.- Travel, but always return home:     Travel is one of the best things to do, but dont make the return home the worst part of the trip. If you do, its not to your hearth's home that you are returning to.- Protect your ideals, but respect other's opinions     Its not because he thinks different from you that he's wrong, or that you're wrong. Every point of view deppends on the angle that you see the point.- Make others be in debt with you    Do favors and help others without charging, they probably will return the favor in a moment of need, but dont get mad if they dont.

I hope you guys have a good day today, and I hope I can make the difference in the live of at least one of you with this email.

April 2013,09,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/04/09/20-19-18/,"April 2013, 09","20, 19, 18...","I love movies. 

The last movie that I really liked was Anna Karenina. Ok, I admit I am a huge Joe Wright fan but the cinematography on that movie is just amazing. The dance, the shot at dusk in the farm and the last shot on the movie. I could go on.

The one movie I couldn't bring myself to watch again is Atonement (from Joe Wright also). It was just too depressing to endure again. Heart-achingly beautiful.

Score is as important as a good plot. Pulls the heartstrings, sort of speak. Ennio Morricone is my favorite composer. It was him with Guiseppe Tornatore on Cinema Paradiso whom brought out my first tears from watching a movie. That scene near the end with grown-up Toto on the theaters. I hope you know what I am talking about.

Sometimes I surprise myself identifying movies on cable by their score and a few dialogues without looking at it. #Humblebrag?

I try to make every movie experience as immersive as possible. I prefer seeing it on the big screen, anywhere between the first to fourth row on the front, no noisy/crunchy snacks (even popcorn) and if with company, who rarely speaks. 

Of all the big movies coming out in 2013 (Oblivion, Pacific Rim, Iron Man 3, Star Trek and Man of Steel), I am looking forward more to Richard Linklater's Before Midnight with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Remember Before Sunrise and Before Sunset? This is the latest and last of the trilogy. 

I especially like foreign movies (non-US), subtitles and all. I am a sucker for movies nominated for Best Foreign Film at Oscars and I have seen a lot since I could remember. I would love to hear recommendations especially from your home countries.

- - -

There was this nice and cheesy movie of Matt Damon called We Bought a Zoo that probably etched deeper than any of the movies I had seen in my entire life. It wasn't because of a mind-blowing CGI or a hauntingly beautiful score but from a conversation between a father and his son:

""Sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage. Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it.""

Great advice, isn't it. Every time I need some push, I just start counting down and it would just flow out. :D

It's really hot on my side of the globe lately so to everyone experiencing the tropic heat, stay cool and keep hydrated.

The Clean Fiend

“Go on, Ted, just try a bite. It’s not going to kill you. I mean, come on, you’re already dead!”

“No, no, I just can’t. It’s so…unhygienic. We don’t even know where that has been. Just think of all the slimy, unsanitary cesspools in this city. Besides, you’re touching it and I know for a fact that you haven’t washed your hands in over a month.”

“My hands are mostly bone and tendon at this point. What’s to wash?”

“See, thinking like that just aids in the spread of unsavory diseases. Here, I have an antibacterial spray…”

“No.”

“But-”

“No, Ted. Just…no.”

“Honestly, I don’t know why you’re so resistant to the idea of basic hygiene. I can only imagine the number of creepy bacterium living inside of you right now. It’s just, ugh, it’s just too vile to contemplate.”

“Don’t point that at me!”

 “Just let me spritz you on this bit of entrail at least. It can’t be healthy for it to just drag along the ground like that. Or, actually, wait, I think I have some plastic wrap that’ll-”

“Ted! Stop it. Jesus! First off, that’s horribly invasive. Leave my intestines alone. Secondly, it’s the style, you know. Everyone’s doing it. It helps trip up the fleshies and, you know, it looks cool. Eva digs it. At least, I think she does. She lost her jaw the other week so it’s hard for her to talk now.”

“Really? Eva? The waitress from Bodie’s Buffet on 3rd?”

“The one and only, man. The one and only.”

“I thought you weren’t her type? Because I distinctly remember you asking her out when we went there on New Years before all of this started and she said-”

“I know what she said, Ted! But she’s gotten to know me now. We’ve been seeing each other pretty steadily over at Bodie’s. He’s still serving up the buffet. Well, the menu has changed a bit, but you know… Stop looking at me like that, man! She’s totally into me. I can tell.”

“Yes, and I’m sure this has nothing to do with the fact that personal standards might lessen with advanced decomposition.”

“That kind of tone is totally unnecessary, dude. I’m just trying to… Okay, look, this isn’t about me! This is about your completely neurotic refusal to eat and all of this weirdo germ phobia crap. I mean, what self-respecting zombie carries around a fanny pack of sanitized baby wipes? I mean, seriously!”

“Look here, I have a legitimate concern. If more people were conscientious about the spread of bacteria none of this would have happened in the first place. And by ‘people’, I mean you! I still remember waking up to you chewing on my leg. That was definitely a violation of trust!”

“Aw, come on, Ted. How many times do I have to apologize for that?”

“How many…How many times do you have to apologize for turning me into the rotting undead? Do you seriously have to ask that?”

April 2013,07,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/04/07/the-power-of-nerd-camp/,"April 2013, 07",The Power of Nerd Camp,"Hi Listservers,

At my day job, I rarely need to turn copy around in less than 48 hours. I’m also a compulsive procrastinator—a high school habit I’ve never been able to shake. So this is going to be an exercise in speed writing.

But it’s worth it, because I get to share my five glorious summers at nerd camp with you. First, some background: I grew up in Taipei, where I attended the same school from kindergarten until senior year. In 7th grade, I took the SATs to qualify for a Johns Hopkins-run summer program called CTY, short for Center for Talented Youth. Some of the camp’s more high-profile alumni include Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg, and Lady Gaga. Accepted students take classes in math, science, or the humanities, and essentially complete a semester’s worth of schooling within three weeks.

By the time I started CTY, I had already spent 8 years with roughly the same 200 classmates. Like many preteens, I was shy, insecure, and lacked self-confidence. Traveling across the world—from a large city to the small town of Saratoga Springs in upstate New York—to attend summer camp was revelatory. It was the first time I was surrounded by new people and could reinvent myself without any consequences for three weeks. The campus of Skidmore College was the first place that felt like home to me. It’s where I discovered the pleasures of cloud-watching, had my first kiss, learned that the only way to eat cereal is out of a cup (so much easier to drink the milk!), and truly felt comfortable in my own skin. There’s traditionally a day where everyone dresses in drag. (I had many a male friend tell me they could never look at a miniskirt the same way after wearing one for a few hours.) I studied subjects like algebra, psychology, and logic—which I've long since forgotten. What has stayed with me are the incredible friendships, the first 18 digits of pi (a cool party trick), and every single word to American Pie (the last song played at weekly dances).

Parents and would-be parents: This camp is magic. It’s where nerdy kids go to feel normal and discover that like-minded people come in all shapes and sizes. It’s where I embraced the fact that being smart and cool weren’t mutually exclusive. That’s the power of nerd camp.

I'd love to hear from fellow CTYers. If you're in the New York area, I'm on a committee that plans alumni events, including a dance in May. And if you know me personally, shoot me an email! I'd love to know who's on here.

Right now I'm an aspiring voice actor, but back in 2000 I had a successful experience on the US version of the game show ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"", so I figured I'd start there.

Security was super-tight—look up ""Charles Van Doren"" to see why. We were escorted everywhere (even to the bathroom) by steely-eyed production assistants, our pre-show buffet came with a free set of lawyers, and all phones, wallets, etc. were locked up prior to entering the set. One contestant was almost kicked out because he brought a book into the green room in case he got bored.

My taxes weren't covered; in 2001 I handed over 39% federal and 8% (California) state. ABC was VERY clear about my fiscal responsibilities and provided many helpful IRS forms; I can't speak for how the other networks handle things.

This conversation (more or less) took place in my supervisor's office at work in the week between the show's taping and airing:

Supervisor: So, Joe, what did you want to see me about?

Me: Well...you know I can't tell you how I did on Millionaire until it airs...but I got a call and they want me on the Rosie O'Donnell Show on Thursday. I might need a couple more days off...

Supervisor: (pause) Right…I understand. Shouldn't be a problem.

My brother Tony was in college at the time. His full name was in the campus phone directory, so he received a lot of calls after the show aired. Several were from female undergrads asking if he was related to that guy on the TV, and maybe if he was free later they could get a cup of coffee? His girlfriend (now wife) was NOT amused.

My other brother Nate was one of my Phone-A-Friends. He is a baseball fanatic and was a sports writer at the time, so when a $32,000 baseball question came up, he was the obvious person to ask. In the 30 seconds available he gave what he said was “possibly” the answer, but just after the phone cut off he realized it was incorrect and had the mother of all forehead-slap moments. Fortunately, his emphasis on ""possibly"" gave me the impetus to puzzle out the right answer. After the taping was over and I got back to my hotel, there were two phone messages for me – one from a New York Times Magazine reporter confirming some biographical data, and one very, very apologetic one from Nate.

Yes, I let him twist in the wind ever-so-briefly. I'm only human.

Nate also has Von Hippel–Lindau disease (or VHL). VHL presents itself as vascular tumors in the eyes, kidneys, and other organs. Once you know it's there, you go through periodic retinal scans and MRIs to keep tabs on things, and if something shows up you go through lasers and cryosurgery. Nate has gone through a lot.

Two months ago, I spent time at his home in Colorado helping with shopping and the kids while he recovered from eye surgery meant to keep his vision above 20/200 (it seems to have been successful). Recently he started a program to help the newly visually impaired regain their independence; he's learning skiing, he'll be rock climbing soon, and as a final exam they'll drop him off at some random Denver intersection and tell him to find his way back. I look at him, and I will be damned and milled and drip-brewed if I could keep it together even half as well as he does.

Things I Hope that My 15-Month Old Daughter Inherits From My Family: -My father's charm and charisma -My mother's determination -My brother's sensitivity to others' feelings

She has my grandmother's (and my great-great-grandmother's) name. She has my looks and my husband's build. I hope she has my confidence and my husband's empathy. I think she is clever, a quick learner, and a delight to be around, even when she's teething.

(She also has my flair for the dramatic, as evidenced by her infrequent-but-entertaining tantrums, which consist of lying on her stomach on the floor with her bottom in the air, not making much noise other than an occasional whine.)

---

Two coincidences:

-When I was 18, I had a boyfriend who told me that he could never fall in love with anyone because a girl broke his heart when he was in seventh grade. She had a very memorable name and was the bane of my existence. I never met her, but I couldn't stand her. Years later, I had a job as a writing tutor, and she was one of my colleagues in the writing lab. Once I got to know her, I told her the story, and she told me that she never knew that he even had a crush on her.

-One of the women in my department at work is the best childhood friend of an ex-boyfriend's mother. I had a long, drawn-out, often contentious relationship and two very ugly breakups with this ex, so I do not ask about him--although I do love it when she tells me unsolicited stories about his various misfortunes. (Sometimes I am not a very nice person, but neither was he, so I feel justified.)

---

While driving home yesterday, I wondered if among the 20,000+ of you are people from my past, long gone from my life. Perhaps Danny Stratten, who I met at a rave in St. Louis in October of 1992, or Eric Hart, who gave me a tulip outside an Urbana house party in spring 1993, or David McCarty, the Mississippi State pre-law student who spent a memorable night wandering San Antonio with me in October of 1994. Or Laura Ortman, one of the first friends I made when I started college at Millikin University in the fall of 1991, who was one of the most genuinely talented people I have ever met. Even in this age of constant connectedness, I don't know these people any more, but I think that I would like to, even if it's just for the sake of nostalgia.

Here is some thoughts from my brain... make of it what you will.

Too often people rush headlong into things, be it purchasing a house, a new car or choosing a career, without stopping to think. People also tend to get stuck in the day-to-day, same-old grind, again without stopping to think. I'm not saying buying a new house is bad, but if you don't work out that you can actually afford it before making the purchase, that is bad. i.e. not thinking things through.

I say, stop, think and inspect your situation. Often you'll see a better solution, or gain some insight into the situation. Too many people go through life in a semi-disconnected state.

For example, ""Maybe buying a new car right now isn't the time - maybe I'm better paying off that student loan"". Actually doing this would make a huge difference to your life in the long run... but most people don't think.

So, I guess, my message would be to not just go through life reacting to the world around you, but pro-actively identify positive actions you can take, and take them.

Stop letting things happen to you, and make things happen.

What would be interesting if you could e-mail me a time where you made things happen over letting them happen to you - I'd be interested to compile them into a list (anonymous of course) and it them out to everyone who responded... anyone interested? Drop me a line!

Hopefully this e-mail at least caused you to stop and think...

Went to school in Canada, and then to college in the US. Now I live and work in the UK and am about to marry an Italian. But 8 years ago I would have never imagined I would ever be saying all of that…

When I was in high school I dreamt about studying abroad. I started a ""scholarship hunt"" - my parents wouldn't' have been able to pay to send me on an exchange program or to university in another country. I was one of those overachiever students, with 9892392 extracurricular activities that filled my days (and nights). The only empty spot in my schedule was Wednesday from 6:30pm onwards. And there it was. On a Wednesday morning I saw a poster with ""Want to study in Italy, Canada or Wales?"" written on it. ""Presentation - Wednesday [that same day] at 7pm"". Coincidence? Destiny? Call it what you want - I was in.

The presentation started on time. A couple of people talked about the opportunity. Photos were shown. It looked too good to be true, but I was enthusiastic. My parents were confused when I got home and started jumping up and down while telling them about what I had just heard. The deadline to apply was a week or so later. There was a lot to prepare but I was determined to do it on time. The selection process wasn't easy. Lots of stages and even traveling to another city involved, but it was totally worth it.

A few months later I was saying bye to my family and friends and heading off to Canada for the best couple of years of my life (or two of them, at least!). Living in the middle of the rain forest, next to the ocean, along with 199 other students from about 90 countries, having the opportunity to do things I would have never done otherwise, meeting amazing people from all over the world, having seals and sea lions as next door neighbours, kayaking every week, printing my own photos in a dark room, having the most amazing conversations at insane hours at night with my roommates from all over the world at the expense of very little sleep (but at that age, who cares!), studying concepts of the theory of relativity with friends by acting out (literally) thought experiments, having classes in a floating building, teaching other students how to dance ""saya"", recording a CD of random songs about climate change (?!?), jumping on the cold ocean as my graduating ""event"" (instead of having a prom night)…

If you have children, or nephews/nieces, grandchildren, friends, friends' children, cousins, or know anybody between the ages of 16-18 (or getting there) who would be, like I was, interested in a ""mind-opener"" experience, tell them to look up ""UWC"" (United World Colleges). If you don't, but would like the sound of this and would like to contribute somehow, look it up too!

I now live in London, a city a love because of its diversity, its infinite amounts of offerings in terms of arts, concerts and events, its wonderful mix of old and new and, well… its beauty (ignore the weather). I was fortunate enough to go to a number of London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic events and I have to say - what an inspiring period to be in London!  I love music, travelling, languages, sciences (physics in particular), movies, and exercising (<3 yoga, squash is fun!, swimming is so relaxing, and running is so much more enjoyable than it was years ago...). I can brag about having grown up in a house with a mango, avocado, coconut and papaya tree in the backyard. I wish the day had 30 more hours so I could get to do all the things I wish I did on a daily basis (play the piano, read, play the guitar, practice French, draw, watch movies - there's too many good ones! - , write a blog, keep up with my online classes - Coursera is awesome!, keep in touch with geographically distant family and friends more frequently…)

Life isn't perfect, but I'm happy. I hope you are too.

Thanks for all the interesting stories. Keep them coming.

April 2013,02,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/04/02/our-son-evenson/,"April 2013, 02","Our Son, Evenson","“In Avril, me give you won chick hen.”

Evenson’s English is getting better. The weekly classes are paying off, but he struggles with proper grammar.

Evenson is 14 and he’s in the fourth grade. It’s not because he’s unintelligent. He’s actually quite brilliant—he works well his hands and learns quickly. But Evenson is behind in school because most years his family couldn’t afford to send him. He’s the oldest of five, and his father is dead. For several years, his mom raised him and his sister, Ludmia, as a widow. Then she remarried and quickly had three more little ones. Feeding the kids was more important than paying tuition.

My wife, Sonja, and I hear his crackly voice come through Skype. He offers us a chicken, and it takes a second for the words—then the profound gesture—to register.

Evenson has one rooster (kòk) and two hens (poul). Three chickens. And he wants to give us one.

His simple gesture grips us and we just melt.

Melting. That happens often in Haiti. And it happens particularly often with Evenson.

Sonja met him first. We were with a team in Carrefour and Evenson tagged along because following twenty blan was more interesting than not. He spoke enough English to tell her his name, and the two set to drawing pictures in a notebook and learning snippets of each other’s language: tree and pye, dog and chen, car and machin.

Quickly, they became inseparable. He spent every day glued to Sonja, learning new words and listening to Michael Jackson on her iPod (He loves to sing, and his voice cracks now).

I melted the first time, I think, when Evenson made a heart from a plastic bottle cap rig and gave it to Sonja. She gave him a hair tie to wear on his wrist.

We took him to the beach, and Sonja carried him on her back into the water. I watched the two of them spin and splash in the waves while joy just washed over me.

We were only in Haiti for a week, but when we left, tears were shed. And we knew we had to see him again.

Evenson became the reason that we kept going to Haiti. We go regularly now to do volunteer work, develop relationships with community leaders, visit friends and, mainly, to see Evenson.

With less money than we would spend on a weekend getaway, we helped Evenson’s parents start a business. Now Evenson, Ludmia, and his brother Josie go to school. The seven-person family also moved from a small tent to a small room that makes our two-bedroom apartment appear like a mansion.

You can’t be in Haiti without being overwhelmed by the poverty. Simple things we take for granted—clean water, electricity, groceries, new shoes—are luxuries out of the reach of most.

You also can’t help but be overwhelmed by the passionate generosity. There’s our crippled friend Leonard who insists on standing while you sit on chairs borrowed from the neighbors. Or there’s another friend, homeless since the 2010 earthquake, who brings us more breadfruit than we could possibly eat.

Your heart just melts. And melts. And melts.

Sonja and I don’t have kids yet, so Evenson is the closest thing we have to a son. We keep going back to Haiti to see him. And to be in a place that feels like home because it is full of more love, joy and generosity than anywhere else I have ever been.

BREATHE. THINK.It gives me chance to think about things from a different perspective. And that's a good thing.It seems to me we live in a much faster ever connected world that's interconnected with great ways of communicating - email, Skype, Facebook, twitter etc. Yet We don't communicate so much on a basic level.... Talk!

So I got selected on the listserve lottery.""I have no idea what to say"" is what people said to me at my dad's funeral justbefore Christmas. His death for me came kinda out the blue, a sidewinder if you will, yes he was old (74) but he had so much life in him. He would get on his bike everyday, go down the library and check his emails (he had a computer at home but the library has a printer and he got from under my mother's feet!) then he'd bike to the bookmakers put his bets on and collect his winnings before biking home to make lunch for him and my mum. Funny little man. Love you dad.

I see all these inspirational quotes "" do one thing everyday that scares you"" or ""do one thing everyday that make you happy"".Well I suggest ""do one thing every day that will make someone else happy"".

As oasis sang nobody ever mentions the weather to make or break your day, so go out your way and try and make someone's day. Yeah I know it's cheesy try a random act of kindness everyday, cause everyone's got their own shit going on and who knows you saying Hi or smiling and buying a randomer a cup of coffee behind you in the line is going to in some small way change someone's day / life for the better. It happened to me. Someone in front of me bought me a cup of coffee and it blew me away, yeah you hear about it and I've read that book 'pay it forward' but until it actually happens to you you'll never know.

So allow me to introduce my selfMy name is Thomas Patrick John Clark. I'm 6' 4.  Im 38 and 3/4. I have a sister Lucy. I live in a small town called Newark on Trent in Nottinghamshire uk. I live in an apartment with my girlfriend Miss shell.I work for a tea company called Ringtons and I deliver tea and biscuits to people's houses with a wicker basket, YES THAT'S RIGHT IT STILL GOES ON!   I went to a comedy night in a pub the other night and the comedian asked me what I did for a job and I froze in terror, like a rabbit in a headlight, it's kinda ripe for taking the pee. But its my job and it keeps me off the streets.

I wish I could inspire all the people reading this to do GREAT THINGS but I've got a limited world view so I cAn't. If you want inspiration go and listen to Baz Lurman's song sunscreen. It's a great song.

I guess what I'm trying to convey is “try to see the good in everyone”.

Take care of each other.If you are ever in this neck of the woods then please look me and we'll go for a beer, scouts honour!

March 2013,31,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/03/31/a-leap-of-faith/,"March 2013, 31",A leap of faith,"Preface:1. I feel like this is a TED talk for email.2. I think this is one of the scariest things I've ever done.3. I don't like public speaking.4. I don't think I'm a very good writer.5. I'm not apologizing.

The Journey:I took a jump, a leap of faith into the unknown.A month away from my 30th birthday I am on a plane flying thousands of miles away from all that I know.I have two suitcases, my phone and a laptop.This is only supposed to be for 5 months.

For the first time in my life I had no keys.I had no place to let myself into.It was the most unexplainable feeling of freedom.

I am a sassy, queer urbanite transplanted into the glorious, interior mountains of British Columbia.From a city population of 5.5 million to 90 thousand, including cowboys.I'm in a town where people my age and younger leave to go to where I just came from.I live in a place where people my parents age come to retire.

I know no one.It takes me a month to realize that's ok.I'm still reminding myself that it is.

It takes me one month to make a friend.I forgot how hard it is to make friends as an adult.I am reminded of the things it takes to be a good friend.I practice daily.There are many days where I am lonely.

I start challenging the idea of familiarity.I start challenging the idea of personal space.A fully furnished 2-story urban apartment to a half-furnished room in a shared house.I start challenging the idea of ownership.The idea of things. My things.I've learned that they really are just things. Promise.

It took me 30 years to realize what matters most.And, yes I assume it will change.For both of the above, I consider myself lucky.

I suppose this was part of a trend in doing things that scare me.Last year I went on a hot air balloon ride in Turkey.I still fear falling.I got a tattoo.It's not a very good tattoo.Next week, for my actual birthday I am going to go shoot a gun.And because it's my birthday, I'm wearing heels.

This is not a fear of getting older.This is not an escape mechanism.This is not to make up for an otherwise ordinary life.I am not ordinary.Promise.

Everyone asks, 'why did you do it'?As though taking such a big risk is a bad thing.

I took a jump, a leap of faith into the unknown.

I needed to be scared.I needed a change – something, anything.It ended up being everything.It is not easy - I don't know why I ever expected it to be anything less.I listened to my heart, she told me to jump.And for once, I didn't listen to my head as so rarely do I ever let them talk together.(They almost never agree.)

A month away from a milestone birthday, I closed my eyes and dreamed I could be somewhere different.I ended up here.I changed everything I knew.This is not the first time I've done it.There's a chance it won't be the last.

I can never go back to where I was.

Conclusion:A friend once told me, “You will always regret not doing something, rarely will you regret trying.”What have you done lately that scares you? What are you scared to try?

…

Why couldn’t I have been chosen in, say, twenty years? Hopefully, by then I will have been to places and done things really worth sharing. As a high school senior, the most excitement I had this week was piling into a car with a bunch of friends screaming YOLO (ironically….kinda) as we left school mid-day for a Red Mango run.

The notification that I had won the Listserve Lottery came shortly after I’d been rejected by a college. By no means was it my dream school, but it still stung a little, and made me a little less confident about the slew of decision letters I will be getting this week.

As someone who was raised being told that Harvard, Yale, and Princeton are the only universities in the world, I completely sympathize with all the other seniors out there experiencing admissions jitters. However, my (extremely limited) life experience has led me to believe that all this fuss about rankings and prestige is ridiculous. So is all the drama. College is more about the work you put in once you're actually there than where you're going.So, all of you in the same boat as I am, I would advise going out and properly enjoying second semester senior life this spring break. Don’t sit by your computer periodically hitting refresh. For those of you with a couple of or more years to go, really follow your interests. It doesn't matter if that passion doesn't seem like it'll impress the admissions officer gods. Though second semester has not been as relaxing as any of my classmates anticipated, a lot of my friends are taking the post-application opportunity to do things they've always wanted to do, from reading more books to starting hip hop classes. But it makes me wonder, why did all these things have to wait until now? Why did we let school and the possibility of college take over so much of our lives?

Either way, I wish everyone waiting on admissions the best of luck. The cliche that you will wind up going where you belong is only partially true. The other half comes from how much you will make of the experience. I hope all of this is not too preachy because lord knows I need to heed this advice more than anyone else haha.

I’m sorry that this email was so demographic-specific. If any of the rest of you have read along this far, this summer I will be travelling to Mumbai, New Delhi, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Seoul. Anyone who lives in/has been to those cities, please let me know about places I should definitely see! Preferably sites off the beaten track. To the experienced travelers (I want to be you), please send me any practical tips about traveling smartly in general.

P.S. If you haven’t already, make sure to read The Elegance of the Hedgehog by Muriel Barbery. It’s a truly truly special book that will stay with you for a long time.

March 2013,28,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/03/28/this-too-shall-pass/,"March 2013, 28",“This too shall pass”,"I have no story to inspire or cause to champion; I can only offer myself, as I am right now, sporadic thoughts and all.  I’m tiptoeing at the edge of twenty-one, a little over half way through my architectural undergrad, attempting to relish in the present because thinking of the past makes me feel too embarrassed and thinking of the future makes me feel too anxious.

I don’t know if receiving the listserve notice and having my first kiss on the same day is a coincidence.  I almost want to say that it’s like some sort of cosmic sign that this day is a really, really significant one.  But then again, maybe it’s not.

I’ve been living a sort of nomadic life style recently, living in cities around the world so incredible that I could liken my life (however undeservedly and pretentious sounding) to fiction.  I have been travelling through this amazing life only to return to my sleepy, industrial university city every four months.  As much as everyone complains about being here, I kind of love it in the way that one loves a childhood blanket – the familiarity upon returning is comforting.  That being said, I do have times where I am overwhelmed by my educational frustrations here and feel compelled to return to my parent’s suburban house just to escape it all (however suffocating going back to that small town may be – that’s another thought all together).

Sometimes I feel so incredibly lucky to have these opportunities placed in front of me that I want to learn everything there is to know about anything relating to architecture and absorb everything and work so hard at this thing that I supposedly love so much that I don’t even ever want to sleep.  And yet at other times, I just want to crawl in to bed and sleep away the days because I feel that my dreams are more satisfactory than my daily life.  I am constantly fluctuating between feeling exceptionally lonely and feeling extremely loved.  I am having trouble separating my profession and education from my personal feelings and find myself letting them dictate each other’s respective successes and failures.  A counselor recently told me that I am having the symptoms of “acute depression”.  This scared the fucking hell out of me.

A roommate commented on how up and down I’ve been recently, and I feel so guilty to place my own tribulations on people that I so deeply care about.  Sometimes I just want to hide away from everyone so they won’t have to feel burdened by this side of me.

I was with my class in Chicago last June when I received the news that my grandmother, or more affectionately, “Bub”, had suddenly passed away.  While my classmates were loaded onto the bus behind us, I bawled in my friend’s arms as he held me and after having shown him some clothes that I bought a few days prior, he said, “I’m so sad to see you crying in your new dress”.  For whatever reason, this will always stick with me.

Anyway, it’s quite strange that this is my biggest audience to date, and it’s even stranger that you’re all behind a computer, 99% of whom I will never know anything about.  This has been quite hard to write for me, knowing that this isn’t completely anonymous.  A handful of my friends will be reading this, and will probably shortly be asking if “I’m okay”.  I guess, right now… I am and I’m not.  But aren’t we all?

On that camp is a girl I’d never met before, with big brown eyes and great music taste. Her name is Emily and as fourteen year olds on summer camps do, we become friends. On the last night of the camp, Emily goes to the disco ’with’ a girl, and tells me later that she thinks she might be bisexual.

After that conversation, I am inspired by seeing for the first time someone who could be open and proud about not being straight. On the spot I resolve to have come out by the last night of the next summer’s camp. I’d never before even considered telling people I was gay.

The camp ends, Emily and I speak online a few times, and somehow manage to always go to the reunion that the other one misses. Eventually, the conversations fizzle out, but I always have in mind the prospect of thanking Emily after I’d come out, of telling her that she’d changed my life without even realising.

Easter Sunday 2011. Sitting in a tree, I come out to my best friend.  By the end of May, I am coming out to my sister, who whilst being supportive, asks me to postpone coming out to our parents and everyone else until her exams are over. I understand, and comply, putting off that conversation with Emily another few weeks.

In June, I find out Emily has killed herself. I never get to say thank you, never get to let her know what she did for me. I try to stop myself thinking about what could have been if I’d come out sooner, because there’s no point.  I’ll never know whether being aware what she had done for me would have saved her. It’s too late now.

I don’t suppose that my story has a moral. But I know that I can never again allow myself to let friends slip away, thanks go unsaid or anything be left until tomorrow.

**However, I want to use this opportunity to do more than tell a sad story. I’m asking you to donate some money to charity, however small or large a sum, in memory of Emily. What would then be amazing would be you emailing me the name of the charity you donated to and (if you want) the amount you gave. I could then email you all back, telling you how much money was donated by all of you in total, so you could see the difference the Listserve can make collectively.**

My friend deserves to be more than a sad story or a teen suicide statistic. Please, allow her to be your inspiration as well. I can’t change the past but you can all help to create a better future.

Thank you all so much,

I will never forget the moment I was sitting at my favorite campus coffee shop, glancing through anonymous posts on a collegiate online forum, when I saw my name. The post said, “Melanie – you’re fat.  If you cared more about your weight, people would care more about you.” I blinked back tears and ran to my dorm room in a daze as questions rushed through my mind. Who wrote this post? Are they right about me? Do other peers of mine think this too? I was mortified beyond belief, and for months after I read the post, I no longer felt safe or at home in my college community. The post triggered my deepest insecurities, and led me to constantly criticize myself. It shattered my self-esteem and my flawless perception of the community I had so recently become a part of.

I have come a long way since that moment back at the coffee shop. I am almost ready to graduate with a double major in Government and Sociology, I hold numerous leadership roles on campus, and I look forward to a vibrant career in social justice advocacy.  Despite all this, I will never forget how strongly those hateful words affected my life and how my experience with cyber bullying was minor compared to the experiences of many others on this collegiate online forum. Cruel messages can lead to eating disorders, insecurities with sexual orientation, suicide, the perpetuation of stereotypes, and unnecessary tears. Let’s remember the true impact that our words can have on others, and the power that we all have to make sure that our words are kind ones.

Bet you've been patiently waiting for this super inspiring email of the day! Yeah well, this probably won't be it. I attempted that, but then I realized that I sounded ridiculous. Honestly, I'm still too young to give a list of wise life advice and I'm not old/legit enough to have some world-changing business to promote. 

If you met me right when I saw the ""You've been selected"" email, you'd probably laugh at the variety of facial expressions I had at that very moment. Other Listserve lottery winners out there, I am sure you know exactly what I mean when that joyous and ""this is unbelievable!!"" moment turns into absolute dread and fear. HOLY CRAP, what am I suppose to write to all of these people?! 

But if there's one thing I'd like to share, it'd be my short time in Vietnam this past January. It reminded me that no matter how difficult, stressful, or scary life can be, I'd still have this one moment to hold onto. Let me set up the scene for you.

There I was, propped on the back of a dusty, cackling moped, thrusting my hands into the air like some kid on a rollercoaster ride. I was speeding down the roads of Ho Chi Minh City at night with my cousin, feeling the wind crash against my face, watching storefronts blur into lights and colors. It was the most unexpected form of harmony: the unified circling of the mopeds, the sweet smells of grilled sticky rice, and the dazzling flower-shaped lights together shared a story of Vietnam that was equally exhilarating and comforting. At that moment, nothing else mattered but this great sense of euphoria. I knew that when I returned to the US and sat down to record this very moment, this would be my connection to Vietnam, a place that once felt distant, mysterious, and foreign. 

Some backstory: My parents came to the US after escaping the horrors of the Vietnam War. Instead of hares and turtles for bedtime stories, I listened in awe to bold stories of escape and freedom. I heard them all: from the stories of the Vietnamese boat people to my mother's early entrepreneurial spirit selling beef jerky to raise money to leave the war-ridden country.  If you haven't seen the Google commercial called ""Graduation,"" about the Vietnamese immigrant struggle, you should. That's my mom. Makes me tear every time.

Life's difficult sometimes, but I'm trying to make the best of it, not only for myself but my family. My parents would support me regardless of my career choice, but as a first generation Asian American, I am still responsible for taking care of my parents one day. I'm terrified because I don't really know what I'm doing or where I'm going. But what I do know is that no matter how crazy things get, how scary life can be, I have that moment in Vietnam. A simple moment that's so magical, so magnificent, that the realist in me believes in miracles. 

So now it's your turn. Did you ever have a moment like this before? I'd love to hear about it.

PS. If you're interested in food writing and eating (as in everyone), we should share our food adventures together. Find me at my blog called butterandbutter on Tumblr. 

Also a program I'm in is doing a photo project called (RE)DEFINING: Identities of Asian America (2013). If you're interested, just google it. We'd love to have more submissions. 

I look forward to hearing from all of you,

I checked my email for the first time in 5 days to see that I had won the lottery this week. I actually hoped I'd receive the email in a few weeks because I'm currently traveling. I had hoped to learn some valuable life lessons to share with you all, but oh well.

I was in the Bolivian Salt Flats with zero internet access when I received the email. It was an incredible experience, 10,000 sq. km of salt desert. There are only 30 cm of salt separating you from 180 meters deep of (the saltiest) water. Follow that up with volcanic rocks and natural geysers, a red lagoon, and natural hot springs at an altitude of 5,000 and you have an amazing trip. And I still have 3 weeks to go making my way up from La Paz to Lake Titicaca, Arequipa, Cusco, Macchu Picchu, and ending in Lima.

This is the first time I have backpacked. It has only been a week, but it seems like a month. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for an adventure. Get out and try something new. Go somewhere you never thought about. Experience something you never dreamed of.

One of those things?  Clean out my e-mail inbox.  I read some Listserver haiku, then opened the next Listserve gem.  I read it.  Blinked.  Read it again.  WAIT, WHAT?  I WON?!  I have 48 hours... when was this sent? TWODAYSAGO?! Ohgeezohgeezohcrapohgeez.

It was only a few weeks ago that one of my dearest friends was selected to write for you all (Emily Johnson, woot woot!).   I thought back to the conversation we had when we were both new to this list.  Emily said she'd write a story - something entertaining for others to read, like the time her parents accidentally left her and her sister at a gas station.  I guess I was so sure I wouldn't be picked that I never fully thought it out.  Now, with just a few hours to think this through, it is as if nothing exciting or interesting has ever happened to me.

Some of my favorite messages from you lovely folks are the ones that tell me something I don't already know, like what to do if a stray cow should wander into my yard (chase it) or what it's like to work at Wal-Mart (fascinating, among other things).  Has anyone else checked out FutureMe yet?  Thanks to the person who recommended that website.   Let's face it, you don't need one more person telling you to SEIZE THE DAY!  Either you're going to seize it or you're not. 

That being said, I'm just going to share some stuff with you.  No big deal.

March 2013,21,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/03/21/a-practical-guide-for-saving-the-planet/,"March 2013, 21",A practical guide for saving the planet,"Fellow citizens of the blue planet,

I've dedicated my career to the sustainable business movement. At present, I serve as the global head of sustainable innovation for a $3B company, and teach MBA students as an adjunct professor of sustainable entrepreneurship. 

How do you make a dent in the most critical issue of our times? Here are the most important actions you can take, ranked by highest impact. I've used a breakdown of US carbon sources to represent global (industrialized-world) environmental impacts.

1.  Electricity: 34% of total emissionsThe main sources of electricity in the home are air conditioning, followed by refrigeration, heating, clothes drying, and your television. Turn the thermostat down in winter and up in summer, and practice efficiency for the others. Wash in cold water and line dry when you can. If you pay for your electricity, you can request to buy a percentage from renewable sources, sometimes even at no cost to you.

2. Transportation: 27%  a) Flying My work flight to Paris last week itself exceeded the carbon emissions of a typical Indian over an entire year (1.5 tons). When I can't avoid flying, I purchase carbon offsets, which fund projects that remove an equivalent amount of carbon from the atmosphere. Offsetting my Boston-Paris roundtrip flight, for example, costs about $18 -- about 2% of the flight cost. I buy offsets from TerraPass, a reputable offset company; google ""terrapass carbon footprint calculator"".

  b) DrivingAnother major source of emissions is our car travel. I love my Prius and believe in electric/hybrid cars. To allay a common fear, the batteries are not significant factors; they are 100% recyclable at end of life, and in any case, more than 80% of the total impact of an automobile is the fuel source. Consider also living near your work/school so that you commute less.

3. Industry: 20%I'm a firm believer free-market innovation, but many environmental costs are business externalities -- that is, business incurs these costs, but society (taxpayers) pay them. Carbon is the classic externality, making the atmosphere our greatest ""tragedy of the commons"". Write to your government leaders to urge action, especially climate change legislation (thanks for leading here, France and Australia). A US governor once told me that for every 1 call/email she got, she assumed 15 or 20 constituents shared the same belief.

4. Commercial & Residential: 11%Vote with your dollars by practicing preferential buying behavior for greener products. Do your research on claims and eco-labels (see ecolabelindex.com), but don't be afraid to try to do good and refine your choices later. For example, should you choose organic or local foods? Both turn out to benefit the environment for different (sometimes competing) reasons. Pick your strategy and go for it. As Yogi Berra said, ""when you come to a fork in the road, take it.""

5. Agriculture: 7%The choice of the food we eat has tremendous impact, especially protein. I'm not a vegetarian, but I've developed a rule for myself: I eat meat once a day, beef once a week, and lamb once a year. I count fish as half of a meat; download the Monterey Bay Aquarium's ""Seafood Watch"" app and ask questions at seafood restaurants about where the fish comes from. For me, this is the right combination of carbon-frugality with something I'll actually stick to; find a way to reduce your own meat consumption. To learn the basis of my rule, google ""ewg meat eaters guide eat smart"".

""Anything else you're interested in is not going to happen if you can't breathe the air and drink the water. Don't sit this one out. Do something. You are by accident of fate alive at an absolutely critical moment in the history of our planet."" -Carl Sagan (often attributed)

I'm Melea, one of those names you can't remember or enunciate correctly for at least the first 3 or 4 introductions. It's fine, I'm over it. I simple it down to MJ when I'm not in the mood to repeat ""Mah-Leah"" in slow motion multiple times over.I'm 21, tall, silly, and really good at drinking beer. Gotta make the parents proud somehow ya know?I have a quality twin brother, 3 sexy sisters and 2 cute parents that never fail to amaze me. The 7 of us have somehow managed to master this casual Brady Bunch vibe, which I can easily pinpoint to the one thing I am most grateful for.

Running, piano and travel are the 3 keys to my heart. All of which make keep my soul smiling for all of eternity.Last year, I  swapped the usual textbooks in for my passport and hit the wide open road. In 10 months I managed to experience 20 countries and was able to shift through all 360 longitudinal degrees this world has to offer. Those few hundred righteous days are a massive collection of the most beautiful moments that I cannot even begin to put into words, and will always be kept at the top of my heart. It's the people you find, and that find you, while experinceing foreign cultures, currencies and countries that make such an unforgettable impact on your life and the way you live it. If your stuck being sad, travel.If you're bored with things, travel.If you're happy, travel. It doesn't matter where you start, just start. A couple months into my trip, I came to the conclusion that backpacking should be a pre-requisite to becoming an adult. It's a lifestyle that you cannot explain to those who haven't, and those who have, get it without any explanation needed. I was planning on staying on the road for another year, or 4, but learned of my acceptance into Engineering at the University of Calgary mid - July, so I figured it was time to come back home and sort out my education.Being back in this strict scheduled school atmosphere has been a struggle to say the least. I've come to the realization that all test writing abilities I'd acquired over my previous 15 years of education, were lost somewhere south of the equator. Shoot, hate when that happens. Attempting to navigate one of the most strenuous degrees I could've enrolled myself into after a year of being lost in the world was a bit presumptuous, my bad. Here's hoping I make it out the other side.The single thing keeping my determined head up is the job opportunity after these 4 years. From the 10 short months of foreign living I was lucky enough to experience, I've learned the world is a crucial component I need in my life for the rest of my life. I need a career that allows me to travel to any country at any time for any reason. I need that plethora of opportunity and adventure at every turn, where meeting new friends becomes as innate conversing with old ones.

So boys and girls, to sum up; round up a backpack and a couple dollars and hit the world, I'll meet ya there.

If any of you happen to be looking for a new up and coming engineer to fit a job outline of ample travel, I'm your lady. Or if anyone could hook me up with a more intelligent brain so I can cake walk through the next 3 years of this degree, that would be absolutely fantastic. 

I appreciate the few minutes you've given me, and will gladly return the favour when your Listserve stars line up.Until next time my darlings, keep it cute.

As I look back on my life, I'm sometimes amazed at how strange and interesting my journey has been. I joined the Air Force at 18, spent two years in England, came back to the U.S. and spent the remaining 8 years of my military career in northern Maine. I was involved in fundamentalist Christianity for nearly 15 years. I raised a family of six amazing children whom I love more than anything. I left the faith, divorced, and rebuilt my life from scratch. I've found amazing people who welcomed me into their lives. I spent a week in the desert at Burning Man. I've loved freely, and have been loved.

If I can indulge a bit, here a few principles that have helped enrich my life. Perhaps one or more will speak to you:- I can't control the people around me. All I can do is control my own actions, words, and responses. Understand that everyone is on their own journey, and has their own reasons for their choices and actions. - Regularly escape my comfort zone. If I'm not challenging myself, I'm not growing. The universe is too big, wonderful, and full of amazing people for me to stand in the corner and watch it go by.- Love more, and follow the campsite rule. Leave the people in your life better off than when you found them. (Nod to Dan Savage.)- Enjoy art. Make art. Be art. - Safety Third.- Don't give a crap about what other people think. Follow your joy.- Life is short. Don't sacrifice joy in the present for worry about the future. Live in the moment that is now.

Thanks for reading! I'm looking forward to hearing from my fellow Listserve readers.

March 2013,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/03/16/little-stories/,"March 2013, 16",Little stories,"When I was a kid, my dad used to pick up rocks when I wasn’t looking and hurl them into the forest, where they would crash-crash-crash through dry leaves down a hill. “Do you hear that? It’s the bork!” What a bork was, he left to my imagination. Even at that tender age, I didn’t quite believe in the bork, but I never fully came to disbelieve it either. Today, when I look out into a peaceful forest, I imagine the lumpy form of the bork there: the world’s most mysteriously awkward monster.

In high school, I spent four months in a supply closet. It was the most logical solution to having been expelled from the bus. I couldn’t get home, and my mom’s coworkers didn’t want a 14 year old sitting with their clients. The metal chair and bare light bulb didn’t bother me. Each day I got to dive into books, and they spoke back with fantastic lives and landscapes. My memory of that drab room is intertwined with the mercenaries of the Black Company, the baffled savior of the Book of the New Sun, the parallel worlds of Amber.

Human imagination works that way: leave a blank space, and given a starter seed, imagination grows and incorporates fresh details.

A decade later, I escaped a low point in life with a year overseas. One cold Scottish morning, I hiked alone through a storm of rain and sleet to the top of a mountain, where clouds swirled threateningly overhead and nearby cliffs promised a quick end, if the gusts should push me over. It was, in a word, grim. But in the distance, beyond the shore, the sun broke the clouds and illuminated a string of islands. There in the chaos and gloom, peering through both the physical and mental storm, I saw the distant promise of peace.

I eventually found some creativity and fun in journalism, and two years ago traded for something even better, game development. The islands, closet, bork and others all get a direct role in my life now, especially as I’m a month into my first solo project. Still, it’s terrifying: my earlier life produced plenty of stories, but not many successes.

But I’ll exit with one “story” distilled from my years of meeting and writing about tech entrepreneurs, and happily shared in a sentence: nobody has a fucking clue what they’re doing. Not even the ones with gold-plated university pedigrees and careers that started at age 14. If you can deal with the grueling experience of figuring things out, step by step, you can do what they do: fail sometimes, succeed at others.

Thanks, Listserve. I like your stories.

p.s. I’ll be looking for co-conspirators soon. If you’re into strategy or RPGs and do code, art or balancing, or want to otherwise assist, email me!

March 2013,15,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/03/15/what-am-i-doing-here/,"March 2013, 15",What am I doing here?,"What is the purpose of life? If you were able to ask most living organisms, I think they'd say to pass on their genes and help ensure that the offspring has a chance to do the same. Is that all there is? Are humans really different than other animals?

I think we are. Or else, would you argue that a sterile man or woman has no purpose in life? Why do we advance medical technology to allow humans to live well past 60, when at that point, most have had their go at biological success?

I'm not sure what the purpose of this life is. James Taylor boldly started a song with ""The secret of life is enjoying the passing of time."" And while I find that quite profound, I consider it more overarching advice than a true look at life's purpose. When done properly, the enjoyment of the road trip should surpass that of the destination.

So what should we be doing here, and is it the same for all people? These are obviously difficult questions that will elicit different responses from different people. I have found fulfillment in the idea that my purpose is to improve life on this planet, at whatever magnitude I am able. As an overarching theme, it is comforting that this can be done through many platforms, be it through one's profession, volunteerism, talent, or simply from forming interpersonal connections that improve the lives of a handful of fortunate friends.

Think about seeing a performance by your favorite musical group. Would you rather see them alone, or with five of your closest friends? Would you prefer a performance to be for your friends alone, or would you like the whole packed venue to share the moment? Doesn't it feel good to share enjoyment with others?

I hope this email has improved your day, even by the most marginal of degrees. I'm interested in what you think on the subject. I know I will enjoy hearing opinions from a group as large and diverse as The Listserve. And knowing that, I hope you enjoy providing collecting your thoughts and sharing them with me.

WOW Timing is everything!

And today I am writing you from my hostel after getting back from white water rafting on the Rio Manso river which is in the mountains  2 hours north of Bariloche.  It was aaaaamazing and this town is breathtaking.  It sits at the foothills of the Andes mountains near the Chilean border.  If you ever get the chance please visit!

I manage a commercial real estate firm near Silicon Valley where all the Tech Giants live, Facebook, Google etc...  I am successful at what I do, not because I have any secret formula but because I work my but off, know my market like the back of my hand & I always try to be in the right place at the right time.  I can´t tell  you how many deals I have done when I called a potential client consistently or met a client at a function I didn't have to be at and on that day happened to be the day they decided they needed a commercial agent for their business.  Timing is everything!

I actually fell in love with the girl who introduced me to The Listserve.  We met volunteering at the Aids Health Project in San Francisco of all places.  We dated on and off for over a year and a half until she moved back east (where she is from) to go to grad school in New York to get her masters in social work.  I think it is inspiring that she has chosen a career where she gives all of her time, knowledge & help to those who truly need it.  Oh and she is also smart, funny & sexy as all get-up.  We both live very busy lives,  she is living her life life studying, working & experiencing New York and all it has to offer on her own, which makes me happy now and I know she is too.  I miss her like crazy sometimes and would love to be in the same city again so we could go on our fun dates and just enjoy each-other.  I have no idea what the future holds for us? But that's OK, such is the mystery of life & like I said... Timing is EVERYTHING

I would love to hear your ""timing is everything stories""  or anything at all:)

March 2013,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/03/13/so-this-is-a-thing/,"March 2013, 13",So This Is A Thing...,"When I signed up for The Listserve, it was a subconscious experiment in anonymity. A friend suggested I subscribe and I'm not one to slough off good advice, especially when it comes to accumulating things to read/see on the Internet. I read some submissions during class and deleted others when my inbox became inundated with the morning flood of law school registrar emails, Groupons for spider vein treatments, and reminders that I was going to miss out on bidding on that pair of Lululemon yoga pants I added to my watch list on eBay five days prior and forgot about. I never thought I'd be chosen to submit anything--the odds, I thought, were astronomical. I could just be a passive voyeur to the wisdom of the huddled masses and then get snapped back to reality when I realized I was about to get cold-called in my Property class. 

Lo and behold, on the first day of my spring break in which I sat festering in FOMO as my fellow law school classmates sent Snapchats of the hell they were raising in Key West whilst I sat in bed at my parents' house with a cold, I received the email that I was a lucky bleeder for the next round of Listserve emails. ""Welp,"" I thought. ""I better come up with something good.""

I haven't been able to, if you haven't noticed. Alas, I'm not in the creative writing mood, which is weird because I consider myself a ""writer"" (a.k.a. I'm a pretentious early-20something with a journalism degree). But I have some pressing things on my mind, if it's a valid excuse: I still don't have a summer legal job, I feel isolated from my friends because I said the wrong things to the wrong people because I was absent on the day in kindergarten when they taught us how human interaction works, living alone is lonely when the novelty of never wearing pants wears off, I'm paranoid I don't understand a damn thing about anything going on in my classes, and I overall absolutely detest the second semester of my 1L year of law school. So you know, I have ridiculously typical problems of someone in my position that are weighing on me like the world on Atlas. 

I never actually read or saw ""The Help"" (whoops?), but I find myself repeating that ""You is kind. You is smart. You is important,""  mantra in my head to remind myself that for all my transgressions and disappointments and rough learning experiences, I can and will press onward. Even within the microcosm of my meager existence in the heart of a major metropolitan area, on the beautiful, sprawling University of Miami campus, within the quadrangle of the law school, inside the library, within my tiny cubicle on the second floor all the way to the right by men's room...I matter. You matter. We all matter. We're not anonymous, even among 20,000 names on a listserv. And we're all going to be OK. 

And just so this isn't a bunch of self-reflective mumbo-jumbo from some wet-behind-the-ears little punk, I'm gonna share my favorite pumpkin muffin recipe because I mean, if we're all gonna have to try to tough it out in this world, we might as well do it with some bomb-ass muffins that are high in fiber.

INGREDIENTS: 1 can of Libby's 100% pumpkin puree1 box of Duncan Hines yellow cake mix1 teaspoon of cinnamon 

Mix that ish up in a bowl (a mixer makes this easier because it's a very thick concoction, but if you've got some guns, go at it with a wooden spoon until it's all stirred up all nice and proper). Pour in muffin tin, but don't fill it up quite to the brim because these things swell up like a Kardashian's ego. Bake on 350 for about 23 minutes. I say 23 because that's what you're just gonna do anyway if I said ""between 20 and 25,"" so there, I cut out the middle man. Remove and let cool. Dust with confectioners sugar and cinnamon. Eat with a Sam Adams Cherry Wheat. Congratulations, it's autumn forever and you'll poop like a dream.

I (slightly) panicked when I opened up my inbox and saw that I was selected. I have nothing wise or inspiring to say. I barely know what I'm doing myself, I can't give people advice. I stared at a blank document for a while before just deciding to talk about what I know best: my nephews and pop culture.

I have two adorable nephews, AJ (17 months) and Mattie (almost 8 months), and another nephew (AJ's little brother) due in August. Being an aunt is the coolest job in the world. I'm determined to be the cool aunt I never had. The kind who lets you stay up past bedtime watching Doctor Who or Star Trek and will run around the yard with you pretending to be superheroes. The kind who knows peanut better and jelly sandwiches taste better with no crust, that some days are just lazy pj days, and who bakes cookies for no reason. I want my nephews to know how much they're adored but not be spoiled. I refuse to be the person with the screaming child they can't control that ruins everyone's mood. Seriously people, teach your kids manners. Maybe trying saying no every once in a while.

It's amazing the things you find yourself doing/saying when you're with a little kid. 'Stop trying to eat the kitty, AJ, Kitty doesn't like that.' 'Yes, you do have to wear your shoes. Pants too.'  I've sung countless rounds of Soft Kitty and mangled rock songs to get a cranky baby to just chill out for five minutes. I've watched enough Curious George and PBSkids shows to have them show up in my dreams. I've carried a meowing toddler around a store. I've watched AJ ignore everything at the park in order to play (and try to eat) in the dirt. I've watched Mattie ignore toys so he can play with a slipper. I've played airplane until my arms ached just because it makes them light up. At some point you will find yourself saying 'Seriously? How did you manage to do this in the time it took me to blink?' or melting into a pile of goo when they climb in your lap just to cuddle. And then you can pass them back to their parents when it's time for a nap or diaper change.

I'm always looking for new bands/movies/tv shows/books/comedians/manga/anime/web comics/websites so if you have any recommendations please send them. Music is always playing on my computer, mostly alternative and indie rock although I listen to almost everything. I never go anywhere without my mp3 player, almost like a security blanket. Right now my favorite band is The Gaslight Anthem. Brian Fallon has the greatest voice I've ever heard. If you've never heard them, you can find their songs on youtube, go look them up. Dropkick Murphys are another must hear band. I'm a diehard Whovian and a recently converted Trekkie. Doctor Who is amazing. What other show can switch from the past to an alien planet to the future and still make sense? Captain Kirk is awesome, whether its The Original Series or the Reboot 'Verse. My goal is to watch every episode of Doctor Who and try every spinoff of Star Trek. I can trace my odd sense of humor back to discovering Monty Python and Douglas Adams as a kid. Tvtropes and Cracked are both addictive and I can easily lose hours on those sites. If you've never been to PostSecret you should check it out. I really love reading Fanfiction for pretty much everything.

Feel free to email me. Send me the name of your favorite band/book/movie/recipe. Tell me about your day or your life. Send a joke. I'll email back and would love to be pen pals with anyone who's interested.

A couple of weeks ago I got to attend TEDx Austin at the new Circuit of The Americas track here in lovely Austin Texas. Lots of great talks and ideas, which you can go watch.

One of the most interesting talks was by Byron Reese, who is so optimistic about the power of technology to change the world for the better that he wrote a book called ""Infinite Progress"" that I just finished reading. His arguments echo those of people like Ray Kurzweil - that technological change has been a force for good in the world, and that not only is that change continuing, is is increasing at an exponential rate. Apply that to the worlds problems and he thinks that we can solve hunger, poverty, even end war.

Whether he is correct or not, I certainly believe that the next few decades will bring change to our world unlike anything we have ever seen before. Some of the things will be amazing - I am looking forward to having a pair of glasses like the Google Glass concept - but there will be unintended consequences of those advances, both good and bad. We all got to see video of the Russian meteor a couple of weeks ago because the cops in Russia are so corrupt that everyone has dashcams now! What things (good and bad) will be captured when millions of people are wearing cameras all the time?

In order for us to navigate these interesting times, people need to be educated on the issues. Learn as much as you can about technology and its impact on society. Read some of the fiction that touches on these issues - some of my favorite authors in this area are Cory Doctorow, Vernor Vinge, and Charles Stross. Read some of the non-fiction, like the book I mentioned earlier, or anything by Ray Kurzweil. Talk about it with your friends. 

Its going to be an interesting ride.

Here are a few tips I learned over the years:

Reward your failures: This works to return my mood/optimism quickly and avoid those long periods of being jaded. It is too easy to fall back into your comfort zone. The key is to avoid the temptation to “shut down”.

Celebrate your successes:  This is how I make continuous enthusiasm a habit, celebrating either outcome.

Think long term: Every year I write a report on how my family is doing and we use it as a way to reflect on how our efforts have improved our situation. (Don't let long term thinking overwhelm though, cling to progress and shy away from overly ambitious goals at first.)

Face your anxieties head on, use logic to convince yourself of your emotional fallacies, and remember that no matter how much you want to fight against optimism, you cannot deny optimists are generally happier and more successful.

Pero de la que más me he cruzado es de ese tipo de gente  que no hace nada más allá de lo obligado, que va a la universidad, asiste a sus clases y vuelve a su casa. Es cierto que suelen salir con sus amigos y demás… pero nada que les saque de su rutina, de su camino trazado.  Y me sorprende porque de todo lo que he  vivido hasta ahora, los recuerdos más valiosos que tengo son aquellos en los que salí de lo habitual o necesario.                De hecho algunos de mis ""momentos""  favoritos son  de cuando formamos un equipo de fútbol sala. Imaginaros la situación: un grupo de chicas de una escuela de ingeniería (en  las que las mujeres no abundan precisamente) que prácticamente nunca habían tocado un balón, jugando al fútbol sala.  Éramos malísimas. Una vez nos ganaron trece a cero (hay que decir que el otro equipo era de la facultad de deportes) y cualquiera hubiera abandonado en ese mismo instante, pero ahí seguimos nosotras pues porque nos lo pasábamos bien, nos reíamos y éramos un equipo curtido en batallas de cuarenta minutos. Y las pocas veces que conseguimos ganar, la satisfacción y alegría era grandiosa.                En definitiva lo que intento decir,  es que vale la pena salirse del camino trazado. Vale la pena intentar algo nuevo de vez en cuando, aunque pueda parecer que no vamos a ganar nada con ello o que se nos va a dar horriblemente mal. Vale la pena no ajustarse al mínimo para conseguir sobrevivir.  Vale la pena disfrutar  viviendo porque sí.Y si alguién te pregunta y ¿por qué? o ¿para qué haces eso…?  Responde pues porque sí, porque me gusta. Y a vivir que hay tiempo para todo.

Tema aparte, me hace ilusión copiaros un trozo de un escritor que me encanta,  a ver si os gusta.

March 2013,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/03/05/olympic-athletes-and-donuts/,"March 2013, 05",Olympic athletes and donuts,"Every four years the Winter Olympics comes strolling through and, if you’re like me, you become captivated by not just the sports (seriously, curling is awesome) but the athletes involved in them.  The various production companies tend to do a great job bringing life stories of athletes from across the world into your living rooms and getting you to not just care about how your respective country is doing (Latvia’s winning a gold medal in Men’s skeleton, you can quote me on that) but how important this chance of a lifetime is to someone you’ve never met.

I’ve been fortunate enough over the last few years to get involved in writing about the winter sliding sports of bobsled (or bobsleigh if you’re not reading this in America), skeleton and luge.  In that time I’ve met some amazing athletes with amazing stories, not just those who are at the Olympic level, but with so many other people working hard to get to that level.  There are people who are working two and three jobs just to support a dream to one day represent your country in the Olympics, and the hard work and effort these men and women put in is definitely something to applaud, even if they never do reach their dream.

The more you read about people like Steven Holcomb, Elana Meyers, Noelle Pikus-Pace, John Daly (the Olympian, not the golfer, though I guess him too), Erin Hamlin and folks like that, you’ll likely find yourself more motivated to try to accomplish things you dream about.  Personally, learning about their selflessness, hard work and determination led me to try to better myself.  I’ve lost 55 pounds since April, have started learning some German and have really tried to not let “I can’t” be something I deal with anymore.

As Sochi 2014 comes inching closer and closer, please take the time to support your Olympians and National Team members in various sports.  They’ll appreciate it far more than the overwhelming majority of major league pro athletes ever do.

A few other things:- If you’re looking to get a pet, make sure you check out your local shelter or rescue organization first.  My boston terrier, Deacon, is amazing, showed up crate trained and house broken and is by far the best dog I’ve ever had.  Why not help a poor little guy or girl out and make both of your lives better in the process?!- If you have one motorsports event to check out all year, make sure it’s either the Continental Tire Sports Car Series at a regional road course or the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series late model stock race at Martinsville Speedway.  Honestly, just go to Martinsville, you’ll feel better about yourself later.- You’re never completely finished with laundry until you’re naked.- Krispy Kreme is a far superior donut product to Dunkin Donuts for most flavors.

When I'm waiting for the bus or in the middle of a crowd, I imagine the lives of the people around me: that woman is wondering what she'll cook for dinner for her husband, mom and 2 and 4-year-old kids. Oh. She has pretty earrings. That boy has a small birth mark on his left cheek and wishes he could get a new pair of sneakers for his birthday. That sweet old lady is looking at me and wants to talk. I say hi and smile. She smiles back and 10 minutes later I know all about her family.

If I get nervous or need to gather my thoughts, I do origami. Focusing on the way I need to fold the paper is relaxing.

I inhale deeply after someone passes by me in the street. Besides perfume, people have their own smell and it's as unique as a fingerprint (but not always pleasant).

Going for a run under pouring rain and against strong wind makes me feel powerful. ""If we can face this, we can face everything in life"". That's what my mom says.

Sometimes I talk to myself in french because…erm…I feel like it.

Right now I'm going to watch this week's video lectures from my ""Astrobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life"" online course on Coursera. I'll be a doctor in 2 years but need to run away from the medicine bubble every once in a while.

I recently took an opportunity to spend a 12 hour shift shadowing an Ambulance crew in an fairly typical mid sized city in the UK. It gave me a brief and touching glimpse of raw humanity. Sitting there in the back of an ambulance as it raced across the city to a someone desperately in need of help, it struck me; they just accept and don't think twice that no matter what 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year in less than 10 minutes help will always be there.

I feel deeply privileged and fortunate to live somewhere where that is possible. Just as I marvel that as I sit here writing this with a few clicks of a mouse this message will be delivered to just over 20,000 people spread across the globe.

Anybody can make a difference, you have to fight for change, stand up, speak up and make your voice heard. It is your responsibility not someone else's! If there is any wisdom that I can pass on from my short time in this world it is that if you see a problem you should do all you can to fix it, not just hope that someone else will notice and do something about it.

Don't accept, always think twice. Go out of your way to give someone an opportunity, make a stranger feel privileged. Pass it on. Let us know how you made someone feel lucky.

We just saw the first substantial snow of the new year and as a kid who grew up in West Coast suburbia, I never would have imagined myself saying, ""I have come to appreciate everything that the city of Chicago offers."" These include:

   1.	Wearing boots, scarves and gloves. Now when I watch television, movies, and my West Coast friends wear any such accessories to look fashionable, I've gained the assumptive habit of chuckling.   2.	'Checking the weather' involves more than opening your window in a city that shines in the morning, snows in the afternoon and rains at night (if you're lucky, in that order).   3.	Appreciate food from pizza to kimchi pork belly fries to what I think is the best vegetarian food I've ever had (a seitan reuben in a vegan diner).   4.	Love schizophrenic/varied architecture forms from ""cold, utilitarian"" modernism, to Asian-influenced, prairie-style living, to buildings in the Untouchables, and Wilco album covers.   5.	Comprehend what it means for a public schools system with over 110,000 students a year to have 6 of every 100 students earning a bachelor's degree by the age of 25   6.	Learned what it really means to have 'gang violence' [I highly recommend this paper for anybody interested in the institutionalization of modern gangs].    7.	Understood that many urban, big-city issues do not emerge as individual human failure or corruption per se, but simply institutional failure—failures of scale: our police, our local companies, our education system, our local government, our local media. These issues at large transcend so many supposedly 'correct' political/popular theories. For example, it is incredibly difficult to creditWilliam Bratton, COMPSTAT and Broken Windows theory for the success of NY crime decline, when the actual crime began falling several years prior throughout the US   8.

But really more than anything, I've learned to appreciate being uncomfortable. I found this quote to express what I mean:  ""To my mind, the greatest reward and luxury of travel is to be able to experience everyday things as if for the first time, to be in a position in which almost nothing is so familiar it is taken for granted. // Bill Bryson"" and more than anything I am incredibly grateful of the opportunity I've had uprooting all of my childhood comforts towards starting something new, difficult and just different.

Thompson,"Short Version: Tell me about the most important trip you've ever taken and how it changed your perspective on the world - 

Maybe it's because I had the opportunity to spend the past two weekends away from home, exploring a brand new city with best friends and also learning how to ski, but travel and new experiences are on my mind.

Lately, when I find myself too deep in the daily monotony that is the 9-5 grind I think of Mr. Thompson's words and try to imagine how best to embrace his decree. Intuitively the meaning is clear: Fun Is The Best. However, it also can serve as a sobering reminder of how trivial, in the grand scheme of things, the pursuit of fun actually is. When considering the number of people facing extreme poverty, disease, lack of potable water, insufficient food, discrimination, and the persistent threat of violent conflict - fun can seem impossibly naive. Despite these realities, some solace can be found in Hemmingway's commentary on the perseverance of the human spirit, ""Man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed but not defeated.""

A good friend of mine recently explained to me his approach to Lent (albeit blasphemous to some of you): Instead of practicing self-denial by giving something up, he uses the time to try as many new and challenging things as possible. This approach reinforced my belief that my concept of fun is also linked to the idea of challenging one's world view by trying new things, visiting new places, and experiencing different cultures.

Surely my upbringing living and traveling abroad serves as the foundation for my interest in travel, but my friend's concentrated period of self-discovery along with my recent trips rekindled my desire to get out and more fully understand the human spirit by interacting with new people and places.... but i need your help.

And with that I turn it over to The Listserve: Tell me about your travels!

What was the one trip that you've taken that had a profound impact on your perception of the world or changed the course of your life?              Who were you with? Where did you go? What did you do? What did you see?

And if you haven't been able to take that dream trip - where would you go and what would you do? 

Most importantly - Where should I go? I trust that your stories will inspire me enough to leave the familiar behind and get out to see the world and all it's imperfections.

In the spirit of travel I leave you with a quote commemorating one of the first great American explorers - John Ledyard

""In 1773 a freshman at Dartmouth Collegeon this spot felled a giant pine  from which he made a canoe  and in it descended the river to Hartford, Connecticut.  He was a traveller among the Indians  an associate of John Paul Jones  an officer under Captain Cook  traversing all oceans and penetrating remote lands.  He foresaw and foretold the riches  of the Pacific Coast and the advantages  of commerce with the far east.  When about to cross Africa he died in Egypt  at the age of 37.

He too heard the voice crying in the wilderness""

Remember that the world is much bigger than the little corner you interact with and see everyday.

February 2013,28,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/02/28/300-miles/,"February 2013, 28",300 miles,"The drive from Seattle to my home on the border of Idaho takes four and half hours. I've made that trip nearly 60 times in my life. It is  numbing driving through monotonous swaths of field and desert yet there is ample time to think. One's mind opens like the sky, but somehow I end up thinking about mundane things: the grading I needed to do, the crap screenplay I'll never write, how I forgot to clean the litter box before I left for vacation. Never anything profound or life-affirming.

A few years ago, traveling home with my family, we were the second to arrive at an accident. Law, I believe, mandates we must stop. I asked my family to stay put as I bolted from the car. I was going to show my mettle. I was going to be a hero. Surveying the scene, I noticed the most damaged vehicle belonged to a family with two daughters not unlike my own and my world changed.

As I neared the car, time slowed. The first child - young, maybe 4 or 5 - thrown from the car and in shock, sat on the sandy shoulder of the road running her hands across the ground. A young woman, from the car behind mine, wrapped her in a blanket and gentle words. I stopped a few feet from the crushed cars, unable to move further. At the sight of blood and the sound of the parents crying and moaning, I realized that I could do nothing. Another woman rushed to the car and sternly demanded I leave. As I turned I caught a glimpse of the second child in the backseat staring at me blankly. I did not look back.

The rest of drive home I fought back tears for that family mixed with the pain of being terribly ashamed of myself. I felt humbled and strangely vulnerable. 

I have traveled the same road many times since that day. Whenever I round that particular corner, I slow down and look to see my girls in the backseat. And for a few miles, I think about that day.

HEAR:

 - If you have less than 5 minutes, listen to James Blake's new single ""Retrograde"" because it's phenomenal.

 - If you have less than 20 minutes, search out the Love Club EP by Lorde. She's a 16-year-old from New Zealand and it's awesome pop stuff. Free on Soundcloud.

 - If you have less than an hour, listen to Paul Simon's 'Graceland,' it's the best album ever made.

 - If you have less than two hours, listen to Nicolas Jaar's Essential Mix. It's beautiful, classical stuff. Also free on Soundcloud; go for the Tong-less version.

 - If you have a few hours, go through Sam Cooke's discography. Make sure to stop by the Harlem Club. All Sam goes best with a Sunday morning and a mug of coffee.

SEE:

 - If you're not watching Bob's Burgers, you totally should. Same with Archer. Plus Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones of course.

 - Cool Runnings is pretty much the best.

 - Read 'American Gods' by Neil Gaiman. 'Old Mr. Flood' by Joseph Mitchell. The Princess of Mars series by Edgar Rice Borroughs. Don't let anyone convince you young adult fiction is for young adults.

TASTE:

 - Cook Alton Brown's recipe for homemade soft pretzels, they're easy and incredibly tasty.

 - Google 'coffee-rubbed steak nom and glug' and make that. A little self promotion, but the recipe is simple, it's less expensive than you think, and it will impress your friends.

 - Kalimotxos are the ultimate summertime drink. Half cheap red wine, half Coca-Cola, served on the rocks. Sounds horrible and trashy, but it's actually the best thing for a sweaty summer evening.

  - Dark beer is always the right choice.

SMELL:

 - Fresh roasted coffee. Chocolate chip cookies in the oven. Wet pavement after it rains. Pine trees. Sauteeing onions.

FEEL:

February 2013,26,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/02/26/women-in-tech/,"February 2013, 26",Women in Tech,"Until recently, I was floundering. For years, my life focused on becoming a professor and finding someone to spend my life with, and neither of those was working out. I applied for jobs, considered an MBA, almost moved to China, and read.   Then I met Michael playing soccer. Somehow he saw past the shell I’d become. He dated me for five months until I made the conscientious decision to love him and really started dating him back. I finally found a job at a startup in San Francisco. The pay was so lousy that I had to stay in a relative’s basement while the job killed me slowly.   A book made me realize that I’m an introvert, so I decided to talk to my boss the next day about making some changes. On the way to work, with a spring in my step, I broke my foot.

Working from home, I started opening tabs about learning technical skills. On the deadline for a school that trains women to become web developers/software engineers in ten weeks, I sent in a rather cursory application, though I didn’t have a clue what things like “Python,” “Backend,” and “Git” referred to.

But then I was in a wheelchair for a while and I had to defer, and to make things worse, I needed a new apartment. (Wheelchair-friendly places in San Francisco? Ha!) Michael and I debated getting married, but life was too hectic.

Finally, finally, things started clicking. We were offered lowered rent for managing a building, and the owner preferred couples. Being Mormon, we decided to get married. We became engaged and decided that with the apartment and school starting soon and in hopes of getting gift money to pay for Hackbright Academy, we’d get married in one month.

Our wedding was wonderfully simple and the stability of marriage countered the intensity of the program. Hackbright Academy was one of the most difficult and best things I have ever done. I slaved through pair programming, learning a new vocabulary, and building my first application, BookFairy. Within a week of graduating, I was offered a job. I nervously made a brave counter offer, and it was accepted!

How come I didn’t find my niche earlier?! I was in technology clubs in school and fascinated by techie stuff. So why didn't anyone ever say, ""Michelle, you actually aren't that great at essays, but you like computers. Did you know that you could have a career making them do cool things?""

I blame it on my gender. Girls aren’t introduced to technology as early and they are subliminally encouraged to get impractical educations when they could excel in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Did you know that the amount of female developers has decreased since the 80s? It is now down to about 9-11%. It can be difficult to work in a male-dominated field, but that’s all the more reason for more women to forge the tech pathway.

I can’t recommend this path enough. My husband and San Francisco’s techies have been amazingly supportive, I love what I’m doing, and my salary is about 18 times more than my total income last year. I want to tell everyone, “Women can rock at web development, too! Girls, here are some cool things I've built that you could build too, being a dev is awesome! You can have love and a great career!”

If you want to read more about my experience and/or to help me support women in tech, you can find my blog and Twitter by googling my name, Michelle Glauser. (Please keep it positive.)

It's almost frightening thinking that your email will go out to the significantly large number of people who are already on this list. Some have already written while others are waiting their turn, reading each email for inspiration in preparation for when their turn will also arrive. 

 

So that begs the question...what do I write about? What's going to make an impact  on somebody's life? It's a question I often ask myself when I'm blogging (reallifehappens (dot) tumblr (dot) com) and most often times either words of advice or quotes come to mind. With that being said, here are some quotes and advice that will hopefully impact someone reading this:

 

1. ""Believe you'll achieve, doubt you'll go without."" A simple, yet extremely powerful statement. Believe in yourself, even if nobody else does.

 

2. ""All around the world we are gazing skyward waiting for God, never realizing that God is waiting for us."" One of my favourite Dan Brown quotes from The Lost Symbol. Go after what you want, because it's waiting out there for you.The time will pass regardless of how you spend it, so use it wisely. 

 

3. Do the things in life that YOU want to do, not what everyone else says you should be doing. At this point in my life, lots of people are trying to convince me to travel...but I have other hopes and dreams that I want to accomplish before I travel. Like buying a house, having a steady job that I love, have a degree in Social Work, have a permanent travel partner (aka husband). Just because everyone else my age is travelling doesn't mean that I have to as well. Do things on your own time, and you'll enjoy them far more.

 

4. Do nice things for people. It doesn't have to be anything big, just something to encourage people to pay it forward. When you do something nice for someone, you feel better and you always get rewarded for it somehow.

 

5. Be less judgemental. ""Every saint has a past, every sinner has a future."" You never know what goes on behind the scenes in someone's life. 

 

6. Be thankful and appreciative for all things in life. Be thankful for the warm sunshine, a hot cup of coffee/tea, the means you have to read this note, your friends and family, the cashier at the grocery store...like smiling and doing nice things for people, it's not only contagious but makes you feel happy too. 

 

7. Learn to listen just as well as you speak. Sometimes people just want someone to listen to them. Learn to ask questions and then when you ask, actually listen to the words they say and provide advice/help only if they ask or it is required. There is nothing wrong with not having an answer to the problem. 

 

8. Take time to read and educate yourself. It doesn't have to be a book. It can be an article you're interested in, a magazine you like, the newspaper, a book you just bought or one you have read multiple times before. Whatever you read will teach you something, which is ultimately better than learning nothing at all. Educating yourself is one of the greatest things you can do in your life so make the effort to do it, regardless of how you go about doing it. 

 

I hope this inspires you in some way or another!

Still here? Okay.  I just realized glasses are made of glass and that is why they are called glasses. Now I realized both glasses and glasses are made of glass. What if glasses are really made of glasses?  Ice cream is called ice cream because it is made out of ice cream. 

Here's my favourite Knock-knock joke:  - Knock knock  - Who's there?  - You know!  - You know who? - Yes! Avada kedavra! 

I want more friends. Let's be friends? Good.  Good.  Good. Good bye.

We bought plane tickets to Florida and gave ourselves a week to enjoy the drive back. It was exciting.

Before even leaving Fort Lauderdale we had to stop and replace the aged windshield wipers. Our speedy problem solving perhaps gave us a false sense of confidence and ability upon embarking on our first road trip. In theory, flying to Florida to drive a car to Maine does not seem like a unique or major challenge. At least, it shouldn’t.

Windshield wipers fixed, we merged onto the clear-cut path up I-95 that would take us directly home. Open windows, feet on the dash – we were free! As I attempted to rig a Discman and speakers in the glove compartment, the car, so old that it simply provided an AM/FM radio for listening entertainment, began to shudder. And shake. And rattle. We looked at each other – something wasn’t right.

“All we have to do is make it to Maine, then we’ll never take you on the highway again,” I thought, pleading with the car to keep moving. We figured out that if we stayed under 60 mph on the highway, the shuddering was undetectable. Good thing we gave ourselves a week to get back.

After a night in Savannah, we took up our slow (yet legally) paced journey north. About three hours down the road, my best friend at the wheel, something gave out. We took the first exit we saw into Florence, South Carolina to look for help. “It’s like we just lost half our momentum,” my friend told the clerk at AutoZone, who directed us northern out-of-towners down the road a few blocks to a mechanic – “Tell him Anita sent you.”

Our quick windshield wiper fix the previous day gave us hope that we’d be back on the road soon. After leaving the car at the shop we walked to the Piggly Wiggly for supplies, planning road snacks for the next few days. An hour later, we returned to the shop.

“You’ve got no compression in your third valve,” the lady at the front desk drawled. Blank stares.

She clarified: “That’s bad.”

The mechanic gave us our options: fix the car for $2500 (more than it was even worth), or drive it until it dies. “It could die in 20 miles or in 5,000,” he said. Another thousand miles to Portland, we opted for the less pricey option, hoping the inevitable failure of the shaky old car would happen closer to the 5,000 mark.

The engine gave out about 300 miles down the road in North Carolina. We coasted to a stop in the breakdown lane and sat there in silence. That thick southern drawl echoed through my head: no compression in the third valve – that's bad…no compression…5,000 miles…

We had it towed to a Safeway parking lot. After removing the plates and emptying out the trunk, we abandoned the car. Trading our freedom of mobility for bus tickets, we continued to the journey north with subdued spirits, finally reaching Maine two days later.

I don’t think we really learned any deep life lessons from this experience. We both drive reliable cars now, maybe that’s it. Or, maybe, if you’re car is inevitably going to die, but still running, drive it as far as possible. That way, the time you have to spend on the Greyhound will be as short as possible.

Spirituality was not really a part of my life, nor did I feel like it was missing. But I am a generally curious person, so in college I tried a Catholic mass or two, and then a friend took me to the Unitarian Church. I have found my sporadic visits to UU Churches fulfilling and thought-provoking. In fact, a few services-- in particular ones about the first principle of Unitarianism-- have moved me to tears (which was hella embarrassing, crying in public). The first principle simply states that 'We, the member congregations of the UUA, covenant to affirm and promote the inherent worth and dignity of every person.' This is, really, a very strong covenant. People do many beautiful things, but damned if we don't also do a ton of terrible things. Promoting the inherent worth and dignity of people who we like is easy, but what about those who have done, and continue to do, things we find morally repugnant?

One thing very difficult about living by the first principle is that you can no longer submit to black-and-white characterizations of things (which one may notice, are constantly being foisted on us). We often surround ourselves with like-minded people who affirm our values and conclusions about the world. This makes sense for a lot of reasons-- it is more comfortable to be around people you generally agree with (reduces conflict), and it is optimal for making progress towards common goals. On the other hand, it makes it easy to get entrenched in your own ideology-- and we all have ideologies. It also makes it easy to think of those with different views as caricatures instead of as humans. Simplifying others’ perspectives instead of trying to understand, seeing them as cartoons, instead of human and worthy of our consideration.

What's the good in living in such black and white? It makes things easier (shit’s mad complex, yo!)—but also makes it easier to write off. Ideas that I haven’t heard about on tv or at school? Write ‘em off cause they’re crazy, that’s what everybody else is doing, and it is easy. But it takes us away from the truth.

I have also found that, when I turn harsh critical thoughts towards others, it is often the case that I am really having critical thoughts about myself. Learning to be less critical of others, and start appreciating their humanity instead, also gives us the room to be less critical of ourselves and start accepting ourselves in a more honest way-- flaws and all.

Last, just some words about practical things I've found to promote happiness and well-being in my life:

1. Bicycling in lieu of driving-- and also learning bike repair skills (many cities have some sort of free workshop program where you can learn for free or cheap).

2. Spending time outside and moving every day (get some sun, especially in the winter, just bundle up real good!)

3. Yoga cured my life-long asthma, and I am dead serious about it. My whole life, I had needed medication multiple times a day and exercise was painfully associated with completely losing my breath. Yoga (not aerobic-lose-weight yoga, but moving-focusing-breathing yoga) damn-near eliminated my need for medicine and I felt physically reborn. I was skeptical at first, but there is wisdom in those ancient practices.

4. Buying less stuff (the less often you go to stores, the less stuff you want to buy! It’s like they designed the stores to make you want stuff you don’t need or something…)

Thanks for reading and best wishes to everyone, I've really enjoyed reading what everyone has to say.

So there is nothing I can say here that hasn't already been said. But, the winter wind howling outside my windows reminds me of one of my favorite poems, so I'll leave you with that.

 Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost First published in New Hampshire in 1923   

Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village, though; He will not see me stopping here To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it's queer To stop without a farmhouse near Between the woods and frozen lake The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there's some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.

Since I'm relatively new to The Listserve, I certainly didn't expect to win the lottery so soon! It's a wonderful surprise. I must say I love the concept behind The Listserve- using technology to keep us connected across the world, despite locations, economic status, gender, race. I love getting Listserve messages because I feel like I'm getting to hear bits of wisdom from all kinds of different people who have had many years of experience on me. It's amazing.

My message is relatively short since I'm still somewhat new to this world myself. I'm graduating from the University of Arizona in May, and I'll be stepping out into the huge, unknown adult world. I'm planning on entering the field of museums, a pretty unpopular career choice among my peers. My parents tell me I'm gonna have to marry rich just to have a comfortable life, and my friends say I'm gonna end up being a teacher. But none of that matters to me. Museums might seem boring (I know my sister hated getting dragged to them) but they are vital to society and communal growth. Without a place to engage with history, we are doomed to repeat it. And most of human history shouldn't be repeated (in my humble opinion). So I urge you to go out to the local museum in your town or city and spend just an hour there- reading, listening, learning. It could surprise you how much fun you have.

I know that I'm going to leave this small city and join the broader community. I want to go out and make an impact on the world, and let me say that I am raring to go. I hope that this small message for posterity leaves you with a piqued interest in museums or even just history in a broader sense, whether it be human history or just your own personal history. There's always something to be learned from past experiences which will enrich our future paths.

My generation is known for the somewhat asinine phrase ""YOLO"" but if my generation is known for living life to the fullest, then so be it. I'm down with that. Good luck everybody, and I hope to see you all poking around your local museums one day.

You only live once.

February 2013,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/02/18/their-turn/,"February 2013, 18",Their turn,"I'm dragging myself through my first post-show morning with a baby so you'll have to bear with me. Man, how my life has changed. Let me explain. I've been involved with a local community theatre group, Shakespeare in the Park, for several years now. We put on one show a year, in summertime, at our beautiful Queen's Park here in Invercargill, a little wind-and-rain swept town at the bottom of the world. In past seasons I've been an actor, and a party person. Mainly a party person. After rehearsals and every show I would have been back at the pub with the cast and crew, laughing over things that went wrong, being triumphant over things that went right, dragging my sorry ass in to work at the local newspaper the next day.

This year it's all so different. I've got a wee boy, a rambunctious little guy who doesn't like sleeping or sitting still. I'm a stay-at-home mum, spending my time reading ""The Mole who Knew It Wasn't Any Of His Business"" and ""Chocolate Mousse for Greedy Goose"", changing nappies and walking around and around the garden with my boy and his best friend, a yellow plastic trolley. And instead of acting in Shakespeare, I was assistant producer, abridging the play (The Merry Wives of Windsor - I took out all the boring bits and just left in the dirty jokes) looking after the cast, front of house, and helping keep things running smoothly. And you know, for the first wee while I was a bit unhappy with my lot. I missed the socialising, resented the young cast members who'd swan in, demolish the food I'd organised, swan out again and never say thank you. I would come home exhausted but still have to get up in the night to feed my ratbag boy.

But then I realised. It's their turn now, those young kids. And I get to sit back, exhausted and happy, watch the show, hear the little bits of gossip about who likes who, and have the kind of satisfaction you only get when you've worked really hard without needing or expecting any kind of reward. And so the season went by, we battled wind and rain and an escaped parrot who sat in a tree and screeched ""What you doing?"" for most of Julius Caesar on our last night. It was great.

To be honest, a lot of the Listserve emails I've gotten I've skipped because everyone seemed so bloody nice and full of positive life advice and I would sit and scowl while my kid dismantled anything he could get his hands on. Whatever, hipsters, I'd think, exhausted. But on this golden morning, with aching feet still and work still to do, I'm a bit full of hippie sentiment myself. Working hard as part of a group for the benefit of the community, hell it's good. And coming home after a quiet wine with the other oldies last night to my beautiful boy, asleep for once, and my wonderful husband who is so supportive of my decision to stay home, yet eager for me to do more things like this, well. There aren't any words, really. I'll leave it to the master:

""With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come.""

Behave yourselves,

One day (way too long ago), I had a BIG IDEA.

What if I combined the things I love into an online destination that I could experience daily to lift my spirits (ahhhhhh)… Inspire me (Yes, please! I would like that)… Remind me of my blessings (my children, my husband, my friends and my well worn home)… Instill gratitude in my life.

I envisioned delicious illustrations …self improvement … daily interaction! Maybe this could help others too! A place with a purpose… What a BIG IDEA.

I adored my BIG IDEA.

Yet, as much as I loved it, I didn’t act on it.

My BIG IDEA waited for me.

I had a family to raise. A marriage, friends, a home and my own existing (and lovely!) growing business.

On vacations I would take out my BIG IDEA and play with it. Think about it. Plan. Daydream.

Years went by.

I signed up for The ListServe. “Ooooh! If I ever get picked, I will tell them all about my BIG IDEA!”

I had so many intentions. And my BIG IDEA just sat and continued to wait. I told my BIG IDEA, “I will get to you soon. I haven’t forgotten you. I am just too busy now.”

The Universe replied. Via email. Tag you are it. Sitting in my inbox: [The ListServe] You’ve been selected.

Such an opportunity! 21,583+ subscribers!

My three daughters asked, “Why not tell them about your business, not the BIG IDEA… what about the business you have now?”

Because my BIG IDEA has been so patient. It has waited long enough.

My BIG IDEA should have a launch party -- a Debutant Ball. My BIG IDEA deserves some love.

So without further ado… Today, for the first time, 21,583+ ListServe subscribers will be introduced to my BIG IDEA. (Drumroll, please!)

I am proud and excited to unveil my BIG IDEA: The Good Life is Now

The Good Life is Now (TGLIN) is a delightful online destination –the purpose is to connect you to YOURSELF and YOUR LIFE.

It is taking many of the mindset activities of positive psychology, spirituality and the science of happiness & well-being and delivering them in a visually delicious game type format in your own personal world.

TGLIN speaks to BOTH what is good in your life now, while also helping you envision an inspired future.

My journey to create TGLIN is just beginning.

I invite you to sign up online at The Good Life is Now if you would like to join me for the ride. I promise there will be lots of goodies along the way!

My friends all told me he was an asshat, but boy did I fall for his posh accent and effort hair.  When he introduced me to his favorite band-of-the-moment, Easyworld, I immediately adopted it as my favorite band-of-the moment.

A week later, we’re stood outside a venue where they’re playing, and I’m begging passersby for tickets to the sold-out show.  Romantic, right?  After listening to my sob story, their manager comped us a pair of tickets.  Inside the venue, rather than “thanks, Eric!” Simon just looked up and told me, “I’ll take a Jack and Coke”.  I dumped him before the encore.

I was an exchange student to Brandenburg, Germany in 1993.  Arriving at the train station, I was picked up by a somewhat radical punk-rock-looking loving-our-newfound-Western-freedoms host family with whom I couldn’t yet communicate with due to language barriers.  15yo me (fresh from Indiana) was absolutely terrified.

We drove home in silence, until “Master & Servant”—and if you know me, you know how much I love Depeche Mode—came on the East German radio station.  Everyone started singing along: father, mother, sister, brother—I couldn’t believe it.  Ice broken.

--

Depeche Mode’s “Photographic” was playing two months later when I stepped into my first discotheque with Lars, my “supercool” host brother who I was secretly in love with.

Inside the disco, throbbing synthpop washed over my body. There were smoke machines and strobe lights and everyone was wearing black denim jean jackets and smoking and drinking beer.  I wanted to stay there forever.  I spent most of my 20s “there”.

I lived a lonely existence during the dot-com days in San Francisco.  I’ll never forget sitting at home one night after a long day of working too hard on some bullshit website, lights off, windows open, fog rolling into and out of my apartment, with Pet Shop Boys’ “Nightlife” album booming, thinking “why am I wasting my time doing something I hate?”  Years later, seeing their musical “Closer to Heaven” brought me to tears—each number resonating with me in such silly ways.

When I left the software world for a few years to try my hand at journalism, I was lucky enough to interview Neil and Chris.  After the interview backstage at the BBC, they tried to set me up the spot with another journalist.  While there wasn't a spark, we're great friends to this day, and have shared a hundred musical adventures since.

--

Last year, I dressed up as a sequined, quaffed Vanilla Ice for Halloween, and danced around the streets of post-Sandy Manhattan.  22 years earlier, ""Ice Ice Baby"" was the first CD single I owned.  My costume was recognized just once, by a handsome lad dressed as a “Book of Mormon” Mormon.  You should see the bizarre (yet adorable!) photo of the two of us.  My costume is safely retired, at least until our wedding reception.

I have.

It was dirty, bruised, and scarred.

But it gripped like any other hand,

Reaching out to be acknowledged

And holding on dearly to a momentary connection.

And it felt good

To not be invisible

To not be alone!

Have you ever witnessed a hate crime?

I have.

It strikes you down, paralyzes you, and swallows you whole.

But it forces you to shed your naivety,

Arming you with a new sense of purpose:

A desire to look never again into bruised eyes

And utter the lie ""it's okay.""

Because it's not.

That the depth and breadth of humanity are infinite,

That we must live through it all;

First, I'd like to say that I am 39 years old. Really. I am not the most successful person, but I feel very lucky. My life did not turn out like I thought it would. I had bigger dreams and plans. But life got in the way.......

I am what most in the U.S. consider a 'red neck'. My husband works in the oilfield. He comes home dirty. I hope that his job is limited as we move towards other energy sources. I work as an office manager of a small newspaper that is devoted to ads. It is a limited job due to the Internet. Most people assume we are small minded bigots, in a backward rural community. Those people would be wrong. I have found that deep down all people want the same things, no matter what color, nationality, religion, or upbringing. Some people are more aggressive about getting what they want. Some are happy with less. Some stumble around not knowing what they want, or how to get it. It is usually the people who don't know what they want that cause problems for the rest of us. They think if they get 'a little bit more' they will be happy, and since they can never get what they think they want; they try to take others happiness. I avoid those folks now. I look for the people who are already happy, because they want to share their joy with others.

One thing I have always wanted was a Ford Mustang. I didn't need it to be happy. I am very happy with my life now. I have a great family and all our needs and many wants are met. We face set backs and an occasional attack from hateful people, but we are doing well. I still never lost my desire for a Mustang, though. Today I found out that my husband has bought me my dream car. It will be here tomorrow. I'm glad I did not get it sooner, because I would have mistaken it for part of my happiness. It is not, it just adds a little bit to it.

BTW, feel free to write me! I love ""talking"" to people no matter who they are.

I am fairly new to The Listserve, and thought this honor would be bestowed upon me at a latter point. To be quite honest my first reaction was something like 'NOOO!!!!' Feeling unprepared, feeling unsure as to what I could add to a community of people who at times can be both inspirational and puzzling.

But I guess this is an overarching theme in life for me at this point in time, uncertainty. I have been waiting for signs as to what is the right path in life for me. I have been sitting in wait for quite some time now; I would say at least 6 months and have been stuck while watching life happen all around me. So Listserve community, I think I will take my prize and look for some inspiration from the group. What have you done when the right answers have not been quite so clear, but the weight of the decision was clearly dragging you to the lowest you can be? What do you do when everything that inspired you has lost its luster? What do you do when you just want to be happy and don’t know how to get there? What can I do to get my life moving again?

I wish this came about at a time when I was feeling more inspirational, I had been kicking around ideas for this for some time and was excited to bring something amazing to the group. But I guess in the true sense of a community, right now I need to lean on you in hopes of finding my way.

I’ve been told I can seem taller than I am when the mood strikes me. And I promise to anyone who reaches out to me, they will get to know that tall guy once he finds his way, and will be more than willing to provide that wisdom, insight and Friendship.

Do you ever have the overwhelming feeling that picking just one “favorite” is ridiculous? I always had a weird jealousy of people who could pick a favorite color, and it would be their favorite for their entire lives. Buddy, give me the rainbow. There are so many beautiful colors in this world, how could anyone pick just ONE?! My favorite colors have always shifted during different stages of my life.

During a particularly rebellious phase, it was always shades of blue, because I didn’t want to be a girly-girl and was in a heavy tomboy phase (boys are blue, and girls are pink!). Going through several depressed years, it was all kinds of grey, then black. Anxiety has always drawn me to oranges; emerging from the depression, I found hope and fell in love with yellow. When harder times hit, I found my favorites to be pastel yellows and lavendars, offset with steely greys, as I found it well represented my internal battles. Recently, I went through a hyper-extroverted phase, and refused to commit to a “favorite” color at all, instead saying that I loved all neons.

If you were to guess that I’m an artist, you would be right. My favorite colors, nowadays, are purple, then yellow. I feel happy and passionate most days, and love how those two work together.

I’ve spent a few years studying color theory, and how it relates to emotions; isn’t it fascinating that painting a primary shade of red will spark anger and aggression in people? That the awful seafoam green of hospital walls is meant to promote healing and soothing? Moderate, pastel-leaning hues of blue are believed to promote ideas, and aide with thinking. The biggest change one can make to a room is painting it a new color, no joke!

Now, before you start calling me a crackpot, go hit up the Googles, and do a quick bit of reading. Color has an effect on our brains, whether you believe it or not. Think back to the movie Sixth Sense (anyone here old enough to remember that?), and the glorious use of red. It was fantastic, and subtle, and overwhelming, once you noticed it. What a great depth of meaning given by the use of color.

The next time you’re in a gallery, museum, or bookstore, stop and look at the colors. Artists and designers spent hours agonizing over them, just to help you feel a certain way. Pretty wild.

So now I’m curious. What’s your favorite color? Does it change? If it does, do you feel like it’s gone along with certain overarching moods that you’ve been in?

Finally, I have to take a moment for a personal plug, here. I’m a painter in my free time, using color theory to make abstract, emotionally driven pieces, and am trying to get my work out. If you’re at all interested, I’d love to put a piece in your hands, wherever you happen to be. If not, I leave you with my personal motto, and hope you realize that it’s true. “You Are Precious.”

February 2013,10,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/02/10/its-in-the-mail/,"February 2013, 10",It's in the Mail,"A hundred years ago the mail carriers working out of New York's main Post Office made nine deliveries a day, six days a week. Nearly three thousand opportunities each year for something unexpected to make its way into your mailbox.

Twenty years ago I was active in some Mail Art circles. I have hundreds of things sent to me from around the world, and others probably still have some of what I sent (I recently learned that the MOMA library actually does). But I gradually moved on to other things.

Six months from now the United States Postal Service will stop delivering mail on Saturdays, dropping to five deliveries each week, and it's difficult to find anyone who cares. Even I don't really care. There's rarely anything in the mail that's worth opening.

So I'll give my old friend postal mail one last hurrah, with an offer to you: reply to this message with your postal address -- PO Box, office, home, I couldn't care less -- and I'll send you something in the mail. If you're lucky, and quick, you might even get it on a Saturday.

For those who choose to take me up on this: I don't know what I'll send you, nor can I predict how long it will take for me to make my way through the list of people who respond to this offer, but sooner or later something will come.

Keep an eye out for it.

This last time was the hardest. Home keeps drawing me back, and I am so lucky that it does. Part of me wants to say that the next time I come home, I'll be back to stay, but what I've learned in this life is that ""the only certainty is uncertainty.""

So the best I can do in this uncertain life is to make sure I'm healthy and fit to live it - in my heart, body, mind, and spirit. Perhaps you'll find my checklist helpful -- it's quite simple but often that's all we need:

1. I love generously -- without my friends and family I would be miserable. I try to make sure they know how much I care.2. I exercise regularly -- my immune system is stronger for it.3. I eat well -- that mostly means less sugar. I enjoy my food. Tangent -- check out a dear friend's new blog about food and home by visiting sweetpotatoandbacon *dot* com. 4. I sleep, and I savor it -- in bed by 11p most nights.5. I ask questions -- of others to get closer to satisfying my curiosity about the world, and of myself to regularly check in with my values and assumptions.6. I meditate -- to remind myself ""don't sweat petty things, and don't pet sweaty things."" All the emotions I feel, good and bad, boil down to little tiny chemicals in my brain. To me, this was a powerful realization.

And I'm planning to go scuba diving in the Philippines in April for a week. If anyone here has tips or itineraries (where to dive and stay, dive guides, etc.) to recommend, I'd love it. Thanks!

February 2013,07,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/02/07/pen-spinning/,"February 2013, 07",Pen Spinning,"Let's talk about entertainment. Specifically self-entertainment.

No, not that.

I mean hobbies. Mine is pen spinning. You may have seen people doing it or even know a few tricks yourself. The range of tricks you can do with a simple pen is amazing. If you want to see videos, there's plenty on YouTube and you should look up 'vicgotgame', one of the best pen spinners in the world. If you think it's awesome and want to find out more you can google ""upsb"" which stands for Universal Pen Spinning Board.

Here's a few reasons why you should do it:- You can do it pretty much anywhere. All you need is a pen.- It is fun. Learning new tricks and mastering them is very satisfying.- When you start 'Modding' you'll have the coolest pens among your friends.- Pen spinning will improve your finger dexterity and hand eye coordination. Bonus especially after all the fun you'll be having.- Your coolness will increase by a factor of 10,000. (According to 3 out of every 5 dentists)

If you decide to start learning tricks, I suggest you start with the Thumbaround, Charge or Sonic and go from there. And if it seems really difficult or you can't get it right away, remember that with patience and persistence anything is possible. This of course, also applies to everything in life.

If somebody else can do it, so can you. You just haven't really tried. I hope you keep this in mind whenever you want to try something new but you don't because you're afraid you'll suck at it. It is ok to fail, because after failing, success will eventually come. Maybe after 100 times or after 1 but you will succeed nonetheless if you're patient and willing to put in the work. Patience and persistence people.

As my mom would say: ""Nobody was born knowing it."" We all had to learn at some point.

I hope that helped. Now, here are a few of favorite books and authors:The Hitchhiker's Series and Dirk Gently by Douglas Adams. Or listen to the radio series.Discworld Series by Terry Pratchett, yes all of itA Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin. When is the new book coming out GRRM???!!!Fragile Things by Neil Gaiman, very good collection of his short storiesP.G. WodehouseSherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan DoyleLabyrinths by Jorge Luis Borges. The Lottery in Babylon and Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius are my favorite two

Finally if you love EDM music or even if you don't, you should listen to Moonbeam. They make amazing music that is like nothing else. A few of my favorite tracks by them are: Spider's Secret, Silence Interlude, Otaria Ursina, I Love Mornings, The Bats Eyes, Flickering Ray, Liveliness, What Dreams May Come, When Flowers Talk and Symphony. Actually there's a lot more because they're so good but that's already more than a few so I'll let you discover more by yourself.

Thank you to all the listservers for imparting wisdom and giving us a glimpse of your thoughts.

February 2013,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/02/06/who-doesnt-like-stories/,"February 2013, 06",Who doesn't like stories,"What can one say to an audience of 21,000+ people without coming off as cliché and dull? Should I talk about the experiences of moving to a new country as a child; or about some meaningful experience that just cannot be put to words; or about my postcard collecting hobby; or about how I’m stuck at a crossroads, unsure of my future directions?

I want to talk about story telling. I’m not a story teller by any means; I am horrible at timing my stories, choosing the right words, or building up the suspension (so bare with me). Nevertheless I love stories. I love movies, television series, short stories, you name it. Transporting myself from the problems of the real world and into a world of possibilities, where I can be the princess from the Valley of the Wind whose courageous actions saves the earth from the destruction of man or the witty companion to a mad man with a blue box. In the world of stories, I can be whoever and wherever I want; where the only restriction is my mind.

Stories are powerful. They produce emotion and thought; and bring magic to the world. Let me share with you some of the stories that I love.

First of all, I grew up with Miyazaki and Disney films, bedtime stories, and cartoons. Even now, I love Miyazaki films with all my heart. They’re not black and white in the sense that the world is portrayed in strict dualities. There are no beautiful heroines and twisted corrupted stepmothers; no heroic princes and evil witches. Like our world, in the world of Miyazaki, the characters are as dynamic and as hard to categorize as real people like you and me. They provoke deep senses of emotion that are hard to describe. They feature strong female characters that are flawed but are also representative of the innate human strength. They are worlds of possibilities that incorporate the impossible with the real. But above all, intricately tied with these stories are the memories of my childhood which makes them so very important to me. I strongly urge you to watch them; perhaps start with the classic “Totoro” to get your toes dipped in the pool of Miyazaki magic.

With so many great stories out there in so many different forms and about so many things, I can’t imagine what you will enjoy but here is what I recommend if you want to walk a few steps in the shoes of a stranger.

Amélie: This is a film that is fun to watch and the characters are so rich, there is not one dull moment.

Paperman: This is a Disney short that just came out on YouTube. It’s fantastically done. The artwork is just gorgeous and the little expressions really take your breath away.

Life is Beautiful: An Italian film about a father’s courageous love for his son and wife in the WWII era. This film was superb in portraying the lengths that love can carry an individual.

And with that, I end my tale. I leave you with no final moral to take away from or some cliché line about the beauty of the universe. Thanks for sticking with me up until here. I would love it if you would send an email to share with me some of your favorite stories or want to exchange postcards.

I stumbled across the initial article that alerted me to the existence of The Listserve. This reminder of the lucky circumstance in which I discovered Listserve reminded me of the joy of sharing something of interest with those around me.

I reread my favourite entries; including the first one I received by Tim Krins. His article was a letter thanking his teachers who shared their passions for life. As a teacher I felt it rather fortuitous to receive this as my first post, especially as it arrived at the end of a busy day. It was something that encouraged me to continue to read.

I watched the websites video and completed the sentences. It helped me think of some ideas-    Sometimes I wonder… how far we make our own luck. Can life be understood as a serious of lucky circumstances, or do the lucky circumstances come to those who look for them-    I noticed recently that… starting the day with a positive thought gives a different outlook for the day. I always found the idea of gratitude journaling a little bit cheesy, but recently I downloaded an app onto my phone and it has been an interesting experiment so far.-    I just wish I could… find it easy to focus on one thing. I’m easily distracted by lots of different topics. A sense of curiosity about the world is undoubtedly a good thing but at times I do need to remember to rein it in

I asked people the question “If you had the chance to speak to a 25000 people, what would you say?” Their responses fascinated me. It started some unexpected and captivating conversations. Unusual questions or “thunks” can lead to unexpectedly insightful conversations.

Suggestions I received included1. 'Warts and all' account of your life in the style of Studs Turkel2. Altruism3. The many flaws of the coalition governments’ policies on the UK economy and society4. The reduction in basketball spending from the Sports and Culture department (I didn't have a lot to say about that!)5. Your summer as a Gamesmaker

Altruism spoke to me most as a topic

“Giving is more joyous than receiving, not because it is a deprivation, but because in the act of giving lies the expression of my aliveness.” — ERICH FROMM”

Volunteering culture was all over the news this summer with Olympic Gamesmakers yet I would argue that altruism is a lot more than simply one action. Instead it is a frame of mind, an attitude to cultivate. With that in mind I finish mentioning one of my favourite charities. Postpals is a charity which asks volunteers to send cards to sick children in the UK. It is a commitment of time and a small outlay of cost (stamps etc). I shared this charity with my class recently their sensitivity and compassion warmed my heart. In both sending cards myself and encouraging others to send one themselves I felt some of the joy that Fromm talks about in the above quote

Would you consider yourself altruistic? What do you give to your world around you?

Have a good day

February 2013,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/02/04/nixon-and-or-soup/,"February 2013, 04",Nixon and/or soup,"Dear all you people:

Do any of you happen to own, or know somebody who owns, a print of Philippe Halsman's 1955 photograph of Richard Nixon jumping?

If so, I would like to buy that print from you, or from that person you know.

Frankly, if you have any cool Nixon swag, email me.  (Nixon is fascinating to me because he proved that being enormously powerful and being a cripplingly emotionally-flawed person are not mutually exclusive.)

I realize that using this platform to hunt for political collectibles is an arguably selfish act.  And I don't have any meaningful life advice to offer total strangers.  I don't know any of you people.  Maybe you shouldn't be reaching for the stars.  Who knows?  It's not really any of my business anyway.

But perhaps you'll be less mad at me for wasting your time and dismissing well-intentioned affirmations after you've had some soup.  (Based, I admit with some shame, on an Emeril Lagasse recipe.)

1. Heat some olive oil in a big pot.  Chop the following: 1 large white onion, 4 ribs celery, 4 carrots, 1 poblano pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper.  Put it all in the pot and stir it around until it looks different.

2. Mince a ton of garlic and a jalapeno pepper.  Leave the damn seeds in.  Don’t be difficult.  In fact, just for getting all wimpy, make it two jalapenos.  Add all that to the pot.

3. Add some dried oregano, some cumin, some chili powder.  Also mince a couple of canned chipotles and add those, along with a spoonful of the adobo they came canned in.  And then a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes.  Stir it around your kitchen smells good.  Maybe you have a bay leaf lying around?  Throw that in.

4. Add a shrink-wrapped package's worth of big, quivering, factory-farmed, lazy American boneless skinless chicken breasts and 64 oz chicken stock.  Yes, by all means, use your homemade artisanal stock.  Good for you.  Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer, let it cook until the chicken’s cooked through.

5. Get the chicken out, let it cool, shred it, and put it back in the pot with an unreasonable amount of lime juice.  Like a third of a cup.  By which I mean a half cup.  Oh, and a bunch of chopped scallions.

6. Serve with a handful of Tostitos Hint of Lime (yes, the brand matters – these have some kind of weird fake sour cream powder on them, and as the chips soften and dissolve, the soup gets a little creamy) and some cilantro.

7. Eat the soup.  Do not photograph it.  Do not Tweet about it.  Do not use it as a metaphor for the lessons you’ve learned in your 23 years on this crazy planet including a whole eight months in Peru where you totally found yourself.  Just eat the soup.  And let me know if you have a line on any Nixon stuff.

Life is random and I won't pretend to know a lot because I don't. As soon as I've got it figure out, I get thrown another gosh darn curve ball. Life is often challenging  and my mess is my ministry, so I am mostly grateful that I am here to share what I've learned to be valuable with all of you. 

    Here are some things I try to keep in mind every day:

    Don't offer support or advice if you think it gives you stock in someone's decision making.

    Your opinion is not an absolute truth, it's just your truth.      

    Don't have too many opinions about other people's relationships - Especially ones of a romantic nature. If you do, keep it to yourself. 

    Often people really want someone to listen instead of receiving advice. We often know the solution to our own problems.

    Make sure the people love know they are invaluable to you. Show them through an act of service and tell them. Even if it is via some cheesy e-card!

    There is nothing wrong with one sided love - Just get over that shit sooner rather than later.

    Refusing to forgive will make you fester and rot, and you'll forget why you where pissed off in the first place or create a grander version of the offense. 

    Don't have expectations.

    Everyone else sucks, just remember that you do to.

    Do a favor because you want to, without expecting recognition or even gratitude.

    Your friends are unique beings - So you won't agree on everything. It's ok to get mad, just make sure you talk about it later.

    Spend as much as time as possible around small children and animals.  

    Don't worry about it! Worrying is not going to resolve anything besides eventually requiring the need for a prescription for Xanax. Though, some of you may be into that. 

    Last but not least, Chicken soup doesn't soothe the soul. Tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich on marble rye does!

Have an Awesome Day!

It takes the joey out and licks its butt so it poops outside the pouch.  Actually true.

Anyways, now that I’ve got your attention, I’m Brian and I’m full of useless knowledge. Sadly, this trove of odd conversation starters (or enders) has never scored me a free pitcher or pint at a local trivia night.

I’ve had a manic start this year, so instead of getting all downer with you guys, I’d like to share a story that makes me giggle. Looking back, this tale technically could be considered my first foray into marketing!

 ""The Time Dazzle Got a Lot of Solicitous Phone Calls:""

It was about 3am on a school night, and I was living at 2209 Van Ness. A grand old dame of San Francisco’s “Gold Coast,” it was bought by the Academy of Art for student housing, which included myself.  This was probably a low point in the poor domicile’s existence. There was total irreverence to the architectural value (truly beautiful) and much . . . what some could call “extra curricular revelry.”  But I digress.  It was my first semester, and between a general lack of motivation for any core curriculum and a healthy appetite for SF nightlife, I was still up applying gouache to an unfinished, un-matted portrait of my buddy Dazzle. Why Dazzle? I don’t know, he’s a cool dude and the picture I was basing it off of was over exposed so I didn’t have to work the contrast much.

Anyways, here I am, punch drunk (probably drunk), with a stack of posterized reference pictures, a black marker, and a penchant to delay the inevitable all-nighter.  Now Dazzle had a thing for  -ahem- ladies of a larger stature than his own shall we say?  So I took it upon myself to find Dazzle a new date.  And I was intentionally broadcasting for love, in all the wrong places.  The marker took my hand to paper like a hawk to prey, furiously creating quips upon my reference materials.   Here are some examples:

 1.)“I’ve got an average size (crude drawing of genitalia) “-Pic- “For a decent time, call Dazzle at (415) ***-****”

 2.)“Dazzle loves meatballs” –Pic- “Let him taste yours! (415) ***-****”

 3.)“Need something to hold onto?”  -Pic- “Dazzle’s here for you (415) ***-****”

 4.) “Dazzle Loves Surprises” –Pic- “Call me (415) ***-****”

The rest escape me.  The true joy was in the execution.  Cue partner in crime Bo, who hit the streets with me post-portrait, allowing it time to fully dry. We must’ve had about 25 of these “flyers,” so to establish a mass distribution channel we decided the SF Muni would disseminate the message with greater efficacy.  To the bus stops it was, to wait for the 43, slap Dazzle’s face on there, and run laughing like a little girl.  It didn’t stop there.  Public bathrooms, bus stops for the impatient to gawk, Subway®, etc.

Now jump a few hours to when I got a call from Dazzle. He was walking to class and wasn’t amused as he past, and futilely tried to rip down, every poster he saw. Poor Dazzle, he had no idea about our distribution channel, or that we entered any place that was open around 6am and plastered him in every bathroom stall.

 	Dazzle got phone calls for months from these antics, but no dates unfortunately.  The voicemails were absurd though.  Truly works of art.

 	He didn’t get a date, but I’m pleased to say that he’s now happily married.

So stop calling.

January 2013,31,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/01/31/greetings-from-the-sag/,"January 2013, 31",Greetings from the Sag,"I’ve been dreading this since the day I joined the Listserve – that fateful day when the email would come telling me I was selected. I’ve been wracking my brain thinking about anything to write and I hope I’m writing something that will benefit someone – anyone, really. Even myself.

When I got that email I had two thoughts: The first one was, “oh, two listserves in one day? Weird!” then, upon figuring out what the email actually was, I said out loud (and in the middle of a meeting, mind you), “Oh! No way!!”

I guess that kind of brings me to the theme of what I wanted to talk about – but first! – a quick shout out to my “bestie” Julia - the Juice - who introduced me to the ListServe a while back and we’ve been addicted to it ever since.

So why was I looking at my email during a meeting? Because I hate my job. Well, not really my job as much as my career path. I’ve always been in Management Consulting but I’ve never ACTUALLY liked it. I enjoyed the concept of traveling, talking to people, and (through several experiences in Africa) helping people towards a larger purpose. I constantly read about stories of people on the Listserve who’ve taken action to DO something with their lives and even have PASSIONS about/towards things. Julia and I talk about this on a regular basis – we’re always complaining to each other about how much we hate our jobs and how we should ACTUALLY do something about it but we never actually do.

So, I read somewhere that the most successful people in life have become that way by taking life-altering risks. From your Jobs to your Gates to your Zuckerberg; they’ve all taken incredible risks to get to where they want to be. I don’t know about you, but when I walked out of the Social Network I was kicking and screaming because I was quite jealous (read: hating). I felt like I needed to do SOMETHING to make a fundamental change in my life and I got all passionate and excited about it on the drive home. One bowl of cereal and an episode of Entourage later, I had forgotten it. It still gnaws at the back of my mind and every day the desire to be independent and self-sufficient grows more and more. But then I think of something else – were those individuals ACTUALLY passionate about what they invested/risked everything for? Or was it just a good idea that they decided to implement in the hopes of it being a money-making endeavor? Or, in the words of Butch Warren, did they just have the “best of luck”?

So I guess this is my invitation to you – I would be thrilled if you could send me your stories/experiences of getting off your butts to ACTUALLY do something that helped you take control of your life. I’m asking for the advice of 21,000+ people of how you discovered your passions and how you got yourself to do something about them. That would be bitchin’.

A quick shout-out to my wife, Dina, the love of my life. Without her, I’d be a mess of a man with no direction in life. Throughout all my doubts and fears, she’s been nothing but a loving and supportive partner.

She never went by Mary, her mother always called her Kathy after the character in Wuthering Heights. Why her mother did no simply name her Kathy to begin with is one of those great unanswerable questions. Kathy grew up in Florida just down the road from the Kennedy Space Center and watched man’s quest for the Moon first hand. Her mother was a secretary for NASA and shared exciting stories about the astronauts and scientists she worked with.When Kathy was seventeen she joined the Navy and became a nurse. She served during the end of the Vietnam War and was stationed in Cuba when she met her future husband. He was a Marine pilot and the two fell in love, got married and moved to the El Toro Marine Base in Orange County, California. Kathy went back to school on the GI Bill and became a psychologist, alongside her husband. They opened a practice together and had a baby girl, who they named Kathryn, after her mother. (Side note: Two ultrasounds indicated they were going to be having a baby boy and after 27 hours of labor and a C-Section, there was a bit of surprise all around. As no girl names had been selected the couple dazedly named the child with the first name that came to mind.)Kathy was a wonderful mother, patient and understanding with clear boundaries. She raised her daughter to trust herself and not let the voices of others drown out her own. She taught her that hard work, gratitude and service to others often led to a happier life than lazy indulgence. She showed her that no matter how royally you had screwed up, you could always dig out again if you just kept going.When her daughter was thirteen, Kathy divorced her husband after a series of affairs. Now in her forties, Kathy began anew. She found a new job, got her own place and proceeded to support her daughter when her ex-husband lost the business. She put her daughter through college and made a new life for herself. When her daughter moved to a foreign country to teach, she was proud and sad and happy, all at the same time. When she moved back and went to graduate school, Kathy helped in any way she could and delighted in having her daughter close once more. The two traveled together, visiting the California Missions, taking the train to Seattle and renting an RV to cruise down the Pacific Coast Highway.Then Kathy developed numbness in her right hand. Dismissing it as carpal tunnel at first, she finally went in to see a doctor and was told the tremor was caused by a tumor in her brain. The tumor was metastatic, meaning it had come from somewhere else. Kathy was diagnosed in October 2012 with Stage 4 Lung Cancer. She had a year or so to live.Kathy immediately retired and moved in with her daughter. The two traveled more, went to the spa a lot and generally enjoyed life. They talked about the life they had shared, the dog they both loved and the future they would no longer have together. Kathy told her daughter to live well, to be strong and to dance, always dance.Kathy died on May 29th, 2012. She was an amazing woman, incredibly strong and courageous in the face of death. Her bravery was inspiring to witness and her love was endless. She is gone now, but she is remembered by her friends, her daughter and you.

I'm not going to give any sage advice here. Let's get to know each other before we start dispensing recommendations on how to live life.

So let me introduce myself. I'm a 35-year old real estate broker and entrepreneur living in New York City. I love it here. Sometimes life here is a bit too fast-paced, but overall, everything is within reach so it’s worth it. If you come visit (or if you already live here), feel free to reach out to meet, ask questions, or get a recommendation on where to eat. NYC has amazing food options everywhere. Let’s grab a bite!

Some of my interests include: cooking, photography, kung fu (I practice at a school called Bo Law Kung Fu), the stock market, real estate, startups, technology, travel, and meeting interesting people. Oh, and chocolate chip cookies!

I've always played things on the safe side. But no longer. I am currently planning to open a restaurant. Crazy, right? One of my passions has always been food. I love eating it. I love cooking it. I even love photographing it. Yes, I'm into foodporn. We have developed a sandwich shop concept and pretty soon we're going to start raising money for this endeavor. Very exciting!

So if you think I can help you or if you think you can help me, or if you just want to have a random conversation, just get in touch. I have met some amazing people on Twitter and I see no reason why I can’t do the same here. I love that Twitter and now The Listserve are both giving me the opportunity to interact with people from all over the world, from many different walks of life. We can all learn from each other so let’s connect.

That's all I got folks. Thanks for reading. And thanks to The Listserve people for making this great idea happen.

But it was impossible. As soon as she concentrated on being alive now, the thought of dying also came into her mind. The same thing happened the other way around: only by conjuring up an intense feeling of one day being dead could she appreciate how terribly good it was to be alive. It was like two sides of a coin that she kept turning over and over. And the bigger and clearer one side of the coin became, the bigger and clearer the other side became too.” - Jostein Gaarder, Sophie's World

I wonder hourly where the world comes from. I am in a perpetual state of existential crisis trying my hardest to quench my fears of death and lack of purpose by reading everything from quantum physics to philosophy to young adult fiction (I recommend ""The Fault in our Stars"" by John Green). I don't understand how anyone can have absolute faith in religion, but I at the same time don't understand how anyone can have absolute faith in science, with so many questions unanswered. Absolutes are only absolute until they are not. I frequently imagine that in a 1000 years our species will look back at this generation’s science and religion in the same way we look at that 1000 years before us; incredulous that we did get right what we did with such limited technology, while at the same time realizing just what a small part of the picture we were then able to see. There is no topic I find more interesting than the notion of time - have we constructed it into something linear when it's really more of a… wibbly-wobbley timey-wimey stuff? #bowtiesarecool

With my opportunity to address you, Listserve community, I want not to give advice or talk about what I know to be true, but instead leave you with questions so I know I'm not the only one out there pondering these paradoxes today.

How do you define consciousness? Does consciousness exist? Can we ever know that to be true? Are we our bodies or are we our souls? Is the experience of life limited to our bodily functions and form? Can we know? How do we find the intersects between science, holistic practices, and religion to best work in unison towards to finding out why -anything- exists? What are the truest pieces of any of these fields? And how can we define something as true if we are experiencing it through a state of consciousness we cannot prove exists?

I encourage you, for just one day, to question everything you think you know to be true. You may find both sides of your own coin bigger and clearer. While that may make death scarier, it certainly makes life more fulfilling- and isn't that what we all want at our core anyways?

I recommend ""Disparate Youth"" by Santigold, ""Settling It Off"" by Peter Wolf Crier, or ""Die Slow"" by Health. All are on YouTube and Spotify. But really, just pick a song that inspires you. It's cool, I can wait...

OK, ready? Set. Go.

You might find that life will take you on some unexpected paths. Life is going to throw you curveballs. Serious curveballs. Plans will be destroyed. Hopes and dreams quashed. I don't mean for this to depress or scare you. I mean for it to prepare you. To inspire courage in you when the proverbial ish hits the fan in your life. Because it's inevitable. What isn't inevitable is how you react. You can curl into a ball and let life kick your ass, or you can fight back.

I highly suggest the latter.

You might find yourself abandoned and isolated in the dead of winter, with nobody returning your phone calls, curled into a ball on the floor of an empty house, in a city you despise, with nothing but your loyal dog and a music collection you've been building since you were twelve to keep you from completely losing it. You might be hours away from your friends and family. You might hit bottom. Then you might fall through and realize that wasn't bottom. But eventually, you'll find your bottom. And it will be beautiful. It will be the most pure, innocent, inspiring place you've been since childhood. Because once you're there, you can only go up. And if you play your cards right, you'll be able to turn it into an opportunity to build the life you've always wanted. The life you've always dreamed of, instead of the life you've always settled for.

At times, you might find yourself thinking that there is no hope. That's where you'll be wrong. And that's when I want you to remember this email. At that moment I want you to remember me. I want you to remember that as long as you are still breathing, then there's some life left in you, and it's your duty to fight with all you have to make it the best life possible.

If you need to, email me. Call me. I'll give you my number. Because sometimes we find ourselves in the most bizarre circumstances where a complete stranger is the only one we can fathom asking our most personal questions.

In your darkest moment, whenever that happens to come, I want you to conjure the warrior inside yourself, rise up, and show the world what you're made of. Fight back. Fight with gusto. Fight like your life depends on it.

Because it does.

And then, you might find yourself.

 Life is a funny little thing. 

You try your hardest for something, but don't get it. You can get angry, cry, be frustrated and it will never happen. You don't expect it, and it shows up on your doorstep. The thing you never sought to pursue is all yours. 

It could be as simple as a smile from a stranger. As rough as an argument. A struggle in your journey. The memories of the past.

Life brings people together.

In the most strangest of ways. One day they are there, and the next day they are gone. And then they come back again, in a new light, and better than ever. It could be the start of something, or the realisation that there is something better.

Life is about the moments.

The smiles, the laughs. The moments of butterflies and the moments of deep despair. It is about the roller-coaster we experience as we lean in for our first kiss, the pit in our stomach as we walk away. The way they feel when we run into their arms, when we see our children, when we are travelling across the world landscape.

Life is simple.

Standing in the rain. Smelling in the freshly cut lawn. Hearing the waves as they softly lap the shore. Feeling the heat from their hand.

Life is happiness.

-----------------------------

And to you,

I really enjoy spending time with you, even if we're just going to be sitting around and talking about nothing. There are a million things I love about you, like your nose or the way you smile, the way you look me in the eye, too. And I just get the greatest feeling when I make you laugh. I feel as if my company makes you happy, and that's what I wish for you; for you to be happy. And when I see you laugh at my clumsy ways, it just makes me want to spend the rest of my life with you so I can see a smile on your face.      -- from Tumblr

""To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxiries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable.""      -- CS Lewis, The Four Loves

- If it smells bad, it probably is bad.

- There are people who have never seen ""The Princess Bride.""  This is inconceivable.

- It makes no sense to exceed the speed limit in an urban area.  Those stop signs and red lights even everything out.

- When cooking chili, lose the lid.

- To tie a bow tie, close your eyes and think ""shoelace.""  Unless you still tie your shoelaces via the ""bunny ears"" method.  Then you really need to buy a pre-tied bow tie.

- With a cargo bike you can do 80 percent of what you would otherwise do with a car.  Hills in your town?  Get a bike with an electric assist.

- Listen to people with whom you disagree.  Challenge your own beliefs.

- When somebody behind you honks their horn at you, it is not a good idea to put your car in park, get out, and angrily confront them by yelling ""CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?"" at their window.  There are very few scenarios where this turns out well.

-  The anticipation usually exceeds the realization.

- If a stray cow should ever run through your yard -- even if it is while your grandmother is in the middle of saying good-bye -- you SHOULD chase the cow.

- Try not to live too far in the past, or too far in the future.

-  If you keep picking it, it’s gonna bleed.

- Brine your turkeys, and cook them breast-down.  Start the oven at 425F, then drop it to 250F and let the bird sit.

- Don't preach.  It annoys people.

- Here is the difference between boys and girls: When your son turns 13, he becomes one of the biggest morons on the planet.  When your daughter turns 13, you become one of the biggest morons on the planet.  (It eventually evens out.)

- When given a maximum word count, strive not to meet it.  Shorter is harder to write than longer.

- Try to leave them wanting more.

January 2013,24,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/01/24/words-those-little-bricks/,"January 2013, 24","Words, those little bricks...","Writing The Listserve is a humbling task akin to standing naked in a room full of strangers, some nervously peeking through their fingers, others turning their head away while a few look on, riveted.

This exercise is not unlike the last two years of my life, two years dedicated to pushing through the frequent discomfort of being in order to connect with others.

What if you were stuck on an island in the middle of the ocean – hours away from the nearest landmass – and felt that life was passing you by?

What if you were always surrounded by people yet completely alone despite your linguistic efforts?

What if your only survival tool was words, your one belief kindness and your one wish love?

What would you do?

Two years ago, this was me. I was 35, had spent the best part of a decade and a half looking for love in all the wrong places but I still longed for companionship besides that of words.

Words, those little bricks I was still trying to build a livelihood out of as a freelance journalist and copywriter.

Words, those little bricks I would occasionally lob at people via a semi-regular newspaper column in a language I was still getting used to.

Words, those little bricks I often felt stuck in my throat because isolation – be it geographical or cultural – can steal your voice.

That's when I decided to make the contents of my head inspectable online and started a blog with a self-explanatory title: The Ideal Wife Giveaway.

Powered by curiosity and the need to communicate, the blog was going to be a one-off, singular real-life experiment which I hope would resonate with at least one person.

The blog became my mirror, reflecting everything I felt at the time of writing.

I reasoned that true bonds – because my blogging was all about reaching out, romantic considerations notwithstanding – could only stem from authenticity, no matter how difficult, ugly, silly and challenging being oneself can be.

I eventually left the island, some nomadism ensued and, in November 2011, one blog comment stood out, starting a conversation across the miles.

On Christmas Day 2011, I was on a plane.

On Christmas Day 2012, my partner and I celebrated our first anniversary. Although digitally-enabled – and geographically-challenged at present although that wasn't always the case – we are very real, as is our love and life as a couple.

Thus, I learnt that combining curiosity and hope can yield extraordinary results. My partner would cringe at being described as extraordinary, but he truly is for not being afraid of embracing a different way of connecting and for loving me the way I am.

And after sharing a moment in time through The Listserve, maybe you and I will continue the conversation too and end up creating something together that wasn't there before, be it a friendship, a project, a story... who knows?

Lastly, wordy bricklaying is my vocation and passion so if you, your organization or anyone you know needs any bridges building, I'd love to help and may even be able to do so bilingually!

Thanks for the opportunity to share a little bit of what makes me me with you, whoever you are.

Yours curiously,

Nearly 8 years as an assistant manager in a convenience store/gas station. Two years at Wal-Mart. The last 16 years in the veterinary field. I've spent a lot of time sharing my experiences with said public. On many occasions I've been told I should ""Write all that shit down!"" That it would ""Make a great book!"" Having always enjoyed putting pen to paper I have toyed with the idea for years. Now I have the chance to ask:  Is there a book inside? My words are limited here so rather than go into great detail, I thought I would list a partial cast of characters...and characters they were. These are just fine folks from the convenience store. Let's just say the people of wal mart site is pretty accurate. I'd need way more than 600 words just to get started on that job. Ron.Mid 30's. Addicted to paint and glue. Face and shoes constantly dotted with evidence to back that up. Would do anything for a pack of smokes. Climb the telephone pole in only his underwear? Yes. Sell all his hair? Yes. Eat bugs? Sure. Winston. Older gentleman. Always quiet and polite. Smoked menthol cigarettes that he preferred to shop for in the middle of the night. That way, he stood a much smaller chance of being noticed by the police while he walked the neighborhood stark naked. After being told by me that he had to wear at least underpants the next time he came in he showed up with a pair...on his head. The man who tried to rob us while masturbating into our magazine rack. The 911 operator had the nerve to ask us if he had a deadly weapon. The little girl who carried her change in her mouth and spit it onto the counter. That action very nearly resulted in an old fashioned butt whippin'. The guy with Tom Cruise good looks who drove a flashy sports car with the plates that said ""I'm Ugly"" so people would tell him how wrong they were. The employee who rang up scratch off tickets, for himself, instead of cigarettes every time he sold a pack. (Cigs were $2.00 then) He didn't know WHY this was stealing. He also held his head sideways. All the time. The night clerk who had sex with the UPS guy in my office. The milk delivery guy who met women on my parking lot and took them to his truck for quickies. The woman in the Jaguar who would sit on the lot and honk-thinking we were full service. We weren't. She tried at least twice a week though. The woman who pissed off the clerk on duty. He, in turn, shut down the air pump at the precise moment she would touch it to her tire. She would then walk back the the machine, restart it and head back to her tire. This happened about 20 times before she threw the hose to the ground and came back in the store to piss him off a little more. It was about 110 degrees out while this was happening. Don't piss off the clerk. The employee who would randomly scream ""Fuck You"" at anyone who happened to be standing there. Customers, me, the district manager. At least he didn't steal scratch off's... This is just a small sampling of the characters. I could go on and on but am running out of space and time. I welcome your comments, thoughts, suggestions. Tell me-Do YOU think there's a book inside? Thank you for this opportunity.

January 2013,21,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/01/21/falling-off-my-unicorn/,"January 2013, 21",Falling off my unicorn,"I really wanted to write some big, deep retrospective on challenge and perseverance for my Listserve contribution. That kind of thing is kind of my thing.

Well, it was.

It's what I did, when I started my blog, The Broke-Ass Bride, which grew into one of the top blogs in the wedding industry. It earned me a deal with a major publishing house to write a book about using creativity as currency to rock bad-ass weddings without breaking the bank. (coming this December!) Born as a coping skill for life’s imperfections, my chronic auto-immune disease, financial struggles and artistic stagnation, I developed a reputation for my ability to spin obstacle into opportunity creatively and with a trademark cheeky irreverence. It seemed like nothing could keep me down.

But I guess the universe watched me leap life's hurdles on my triumphant unicorn of resilience, turning piles of strugglesome shit into rainbows with my magical brand of fairy dust, and decided (in its infinite wisdom) to up the game and see just how much I could take. I had been focused on maintaining my success, so desperate to remain self-employed and free from corporate cubicles, that I neglected my health personal life.

I got hit with an aggressively progressive depression, disease complications and a rare illness necessitating a flurry of surgeries, growing medical debt, and a sexual assault. And just like that, my self-destructive and addictive tendencies took control and bullied my moxie and persistence into submission like overgrown schoolyard tormentors.

I was ashamed and guilt-ridden about how burdensome I felt. Hell, if *I* was so tired of caring about me, I couldn't imagine how exhausting it must be for everyone else. I withdrew from my husband, friends and family, in a ridiculously misguided effort to ""protect"" them all from my demons. What a foolish girl I was, to believe the lies my depression told me for so long.

With the help of great doctors, treatments, perspective, support, faith and forgiveness, I've begun to find my feet again. Reconnecting with those I've hurt, pushed away or neglected, and trying to make amends. Letting people love me (or not) on their own terms. Grateful for the chance to evolve, painful as it was, into a stronger, deeper, richer version of Dana LaRue: rider of my triumphant unicorn of resilience, spinner of obstacle into opportunity, going from broke-ass to bad-ass.

In an earlier Listserve email, a writer shared the phrase ""ad astra per aspera"" - latin for ""through struggles to the stars."" This Wednesday the 23rd is my 35th birthday and I can’t wait. Not eager to see where this year takes me, but rather where *I* can take this year. To celebrate, I’m having “ad astra per aspera” tattooed on my wrist to honor where I’ve been, and to remind me where I’m capable of going.

Well, hey, how ‘bout that. Looks like I did end up writing a true-to-form deep, retrospective look at challenge and perseverance. I guess I really am back in the saddle, after all. Yeehaw.

Thanks, Listserve, for the chance to share my story. May it help someone out there through his or her own dark hour. And thanks, listserve nation, for bearing witness. Pass this on if you know someone who might benefit from it. Or share your own story with me, or encouraging words, or drawings of me on a unicorn turning piles of shit into rainbows… whatever you’re inspired to send!

What the heck do I have to write about? I'll just share some of the thoughts that often cross my mind:

I think about how I am but one of 7 billion members of my species, all crammed onto a tiny planet orbiting just one of over 200 billion stars in just one of the hundreds of billions of galaxies in our known universe.

This makes me feel incredibly insignificant.

I think about how I experience the world, and how my understanding of it is encoded in some 100 Billion neurons, and how rapid waves of impulses interact to form an emergent pattern that we call consciousness. I marvel at the fact that some clever molecules combined and evolved over billions of years to form the immensely complicated structures of life, and how each of those molecules are comprised of atoms that were forged in the heart of a dying star.

This makes me feel incredibly special.

Even though we are insignificant in the face of the greater universe, we make meaning for ourselves and each other. Each and every one of us is part of an extended family that spans the globe, huddling together in the dark on ""a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam,"" to quote Carl Sagan. We all have the same fundamental hopes and dreams, fears and weaknesses. We have triumphed together over millions of years and built a civilization together. In the face of all of this, our problems and disagreements with each other are incredibly petty.

I leave you with a simple request: Think about our story, and where it's going. Think of ways to improve the world, even just a little bit. And above all, think for yourself.

His suicide has haunted me in the past couple weeks. Today I write to you not on the subject I would like, but rather a burden on my heart since I heard of my friend’s passing. Suicide is not a common discussion in society, nor is it a cheery subject to talk about. However, it is a discussion that needs to occur. Increasing suicide awareness and recognizing the warning signs can prevent grief and sorrow.

Worldwide, suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death among people ranging in the age from 15-44. Suicide rates are climbing and are the highest rate in fifteen years. In the United States alone there were 38,364 suicide deaths in 2010. Ninety percent of those who commit suicide have a diagnosable and treatable condition.  We need to recognize that suicidal thoughts not a character defect, but are typically a sign of a mental condition.

Fifty to Seventy Five percent of people contemplating suicide give some sort of warning to their loved ones. Take some time to learn the warning signs in order to recognize and respond should a loved one display one or more of these behaviors. Below are some warning signs of depression and suicidal tendencies from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.

- Talking about wanting to die or to kill oneself.- Looking for a way to kill oneself, such as searching online or buying a gun.- Talking about feeling hopeless or having no reason to live.- Talking about feeling trapped or in unbearable pain.- Talking about being a burden to others.- Increasing the use of alcohol or drugs.- Acting anxious or agitated; behaving recklessly.- Sleeping too little or too much.- Withdrawing or feeling isolated.- Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge.- Displaying extreme mood swings.

If you or anyone you know shows any of these signs please seek counsel and get professional help. Do not ignore the signs or keep suicidal thoughts in confidence with others. Often those with suicidal thoughts will believe they cannot be helped, be actively involved in helping them seek help including taking them to treatment.

My hope is that this raises awareness and could contribute to preventing this loss of life.  I pray that none of you are ever affected by suicide, but always be aware. Please do not be afraid to speak out about suicide. The greater the awareness and the more openness to discussion, the more we can help those in need.

Sincerely,

January 2013,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/01/18/beginnings-and-endings/,"January 2013, 18",Beginnings and endings,"This listserv has caught me at one of the busiest and chaotic points of my life. With only one more semester of university ahead of me it's hard to know what to write. Should I talk about what brought me to where I am today? About how the last few years of my life have changed me? Or maybe my plans for the future.

No, instead I want to talk about right now, partially because none of those things are particularly interesting, partially because just thinking about the future enough to make me anxious. Right now I'm reading A Memory of Light, the 14th and final book in the Wheel of Time series. I've been reading this series since I was 13 and my time with the world and characters includes my entire adolescence. I'm sad that the story is ending, it feels like I am saying goodbye to an old friend. 

More goodbyes lurk on the horizon. At the end of this semester I'll be saying goodbyes to friends both old and new. I will have to say au revoir to the city, adieu to my school, and so long to a country.

But just as I can pick up my beaten copy of The Eye of the World, I can return to all of these people and places in the future. Maybe it's better to think of them as 'laters' than farewells.

For now, I plan to take my time reading A Memory of Light and to savor my last few months here. The future is uncertain; in April I will be starting a new chapter in my life and who knows what will happen after Tarmon Gai'don. There will be new places, new friends, new books, but they'll never replace the old ones, nor do they have to. And that is comforting.

""The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legends fade to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the third age by some, an Age yet to come, an age long pass, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings or endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.""

I’m working for a deadline next Tuesday and I am quite stressed as an architecture student. But I realized this is a rare chance to broaden my worldview.  So please feel free to comment on my mail and point out where I’m wrong.

I have a thirst for knowledge. I read a few books every month and try to discuss them with peers. Every interesting subject I come across leaves me knowing less about the world and wanting to know more.

I am in a position to do something, brought up in one of the wealthiest countries in this world, and I am grateful for this. I don’t know if grateful would be a correct word, because for me thankful feels hypocrite, thanks I have it better than some kid in the slums. I want to do something about that.

What is your vision of the future? Can you back-cast such a future? Imagine a future and think about what you need to do now  for that specific future. Is it naïve to think about green roofs and free energy in the next few decades? It leaves a huge food problem. How can we eliminate poverty. Is it possible to modernize the world. Do you think that family planning, emancipation for woman is the best way to do this?

In an ever changing world, how far can our empathy extend? In history from family to tribe, to religion, to country. Can we now feel empathy with the whole world? This mail reaches 21647 people. I can reach and read something from the other side of our little globe in space for the first time in the ~150.000 years of human existence. Boundaries, politics, factions, religions, nations, race seem to divide us, but we’re all humans, all even and all here.

What is next? I wouldn’t say Mars. But it is a goal that is beyond this world.

So when I think about this I feel utterly inept. But am I so wrong? All those naïve dreams during all these centuries of human suffering, are those dreams finally possible?

Probably I’ll lose my ideals in some years. Possibly I won’t change much in this world, if anything, before I die.

But until then I want to be aware of my fellow humans. So from me to you;

My 15 month son taught me to have a good time, all you need is graham crackers and a plastic spatula, my grandpa taught me that crunchy peanut butter is good for your golf swing (I'm still trying to verify that claim), and my wife taught me that life is too short for bad coffee or light beer. However, the most humbling and inspiring lesson someone has ever taught me was in 2011 when my brother was diagnosed with cancer. Faced with this overwhelming situation, he did the most amazing thing: he laughed at it, he made jokes about it. It would have been so easy for him get lost in self pity, but he chose to make the best of it. I've always been drawn to comedy and jokes (which is ironic, since anybody close to me will tell you that I'm tragically not funny), but after witnessing my brother's experience with cancer, I realized how essential they actually are.

What makes you laugh? How has humor changed your life? I would love to hear from you.

January 2013,13,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/01/13/starting-anew/,"January 2013, 13",Starting Anew,"Hi Everyone,

I originally joined the list serve as I wanted the opportunity to maybe one day promote my own business, BUT, my view of the list serve purpose has changed immensely!  I love receiving and reading about all of the different experiences, places and people everyday.

So here's what I have decided to share -

Follow your dreams, we live one life, make it count.  Pay it forward and practice random acts of kindness. I have always thought you need to have a 9-5 job and be sensible, stable and a hard worker, only then will you have a 'good' life.  Well, I have lived like that for most of my life, (only 34 years so far!), but I have decided I don't want a 'good life', I want a GREAT life!  I have been with the man of my dreams for almost 5 years and we have a beautiful little boy.  I want my son to grow up with amazing experiences and the knowledge he could be and do great things if he chooses to.  That doesn't mean an exciting job or doing dangerous things, it can be the small things you do.  Me personally, I am building my own photography business, which is my passion, I don't want to live the rest of my life in the daily grind, so I am making changes now, one day at a time.  My partner, he is living his dream as a DJ/Selector.  We are teaching our son, through the way we live, that he can be a 'Fireman-Super Hero-DJ-Motorbike Riding Stuntman'...if he really wants to be!  :)

My biggest piece of advice I can give to anyone is to make good financial investments early in your life....in the long term you will be grateful you did.  I chose not to and am severely kicking myself now over my lack of insight as a young person.  Living for the moment is in my nature, but I have learned you must also plan for the unknown in your future.  Even if it's a small investment now, it could be your saving grace in the future.  for example, at 19 I had the opportunity to buy a house, a medium size house for just $16,000, I listened to the advice of my then boyfriend and bought a new car instead.  That house is now worth over $100,000.  This is only 15 years later...ooh what I could do with one hundred thousand dollars right now....meanwhile the car I bought is long gone and never returned anything back to me.  Word from the wise...invest where and when you can, keep your credit clear and if you earn ten dollars, spend like you earned only five.

I live everyday filled with music, music is like oil to the rusty gate of life stresses.  I have such an eclectic taste in music.  I love Earth, Wind and Fire, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye but equally love Salt'n'Pepa, Tanya Stephens, Jah Cure, Damien Marley  Whitney Houston, Usher, a LOT of 90s R&B and pop.

I love laughing until you cry and your stomach hurts, a long day at the beach swimming and playing, running in the pouring rain on really hot, humid days, cuddling up and watching favourite movies on freezing cold, snowy days. I love books, I love to read and learn and know and share what I learn.

My advice on love is a cliche, love yourself first, with or without modifications.  Learn to love the person you are, look at your body every day and appreciate it, enjoy the way it moves and works, marvel at such a wonderful creation.  Be the kind of person you would like to be with  Then, when someone else can do the same thing, love you as a whole person just as you are, that's love.  Relationships are hard work and not always perfect, but, they can also be amazing adventures with equally amazing people.

You have unlimited potential and opportunities, explore life and learn about new people, places and things.

Live everyday with the intention to empower others to be the best they can be at whatever they choose to do, even in the small details - I believe that is the meaning of life, be the best version of you that you can be and empower the next generation to do the same.   Above all, have an amazing life!

My sister entertains when she doesn’t even mean to. With aspergers syndrome, she is always literal, serious, and takes things exactly as you say them. My sarcastic family doesn’t make life easy for her and yes, I might get a little carried away from time to time, but she has no idea how her unintentional humor lights up our lives.

She had just gotten back from her favorite yearly activity – StarFest, where self-proclaimed dorks and geeks gather in a convention style hotel while wearing their favorite fantasy-inspired costume and participate in well, I went once for moral support and I couldn’t really tell you. I’ll relive that if I get this Listserve opportunity again.

She was pooped. And cranky. Her whole life she has worn exhaustion on her sleeve like a sweater and her bitchiness was apparent right off the bat that afternoon. (Disclaimer – Mitch, name changed, is her now fiancé)

Mom – “Honey did you not get a lot of sleep last night?”Sister – (loud sigh) “PSH uh, NO”Mom – “I’m sorry why is that?”Sister – “WELL… the guy lying next to Mitch was snoring SO LOUD we couldn’t sleep”Me – “Um, there was a guy next to Mitch?”Sister – “Yeah. And I elbowed Mitch and was like MITCH. GET HIM TO SHUT UP”Me – “So, it’s you, Mitch and this guy?”Sister – “Yeah. So Mitch grabs his light saber and starts to poke him, and FINALLY he shut up but it took awhile so I’m really tired”Me – straight face - “What exactly do you mean by ‘light saber’”Sister – annoyed - “You have to know what a light saber is…”Mom – stopping the train wreck -  “MINDY. Enough.”

Meanwhile, in a rocking chair a few feet away, my dad’s shoulders are shrugging with laughter while he listens in. The next few minutes involved tales of infuriating Star Trek assholes and uninvited furries; long lines for autographs and admissions of needing to “clean the con-funk” off. (Con-funk is the result of several days of not showering while in close quarters with other costume loving individuals – if you didn’t know that already) What can I say – it was just hilarious. So many conversations I have had with my sister in my life have gone that way.

The color she brings with her weirdness is fantastic. I wish all of you at some point have an individual in your lives that brings “different” into your reality, whatever side of the spectrum you are on. I am very lucky to have it- and I’m fairly confident my sister thinks I am ridiculous. Sometimes I think that to her, I am the “different”!

Thanks for reading, and go Broncos.

My personal contribution over the past 4 years is a local satire news publication called Fair City News, which you can visit online. 

Simple idea really, take local news and put a creative & funny spin to it. Which I find to be an enormous amount of fun. Local community supports it, people who move to town find it as a cultural guide and folks who move away use it as a resource to keep in touch. 

What do you love to do? What can you do that is different? How can you present an old idea in a new way?  That's my challenge to you. Find what you love, twist it to make it new. Have fun and make a little profit. Who knows, it could blow up big time. Passion to profit.

January 2013,10,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/01/10/something-to-reflect-on/,"January 2013, 10",Something to reflect on.,"My mother is from an island called Brac in Croatia. It is truly a remarkably beautiful place.

She didn't own a pair of shoes until she was maybe 8 years old. She told me that for Christmas they may, if they were good, get an apple or a fig as a present.

Her father was a simple man, favouring the communist party and not terribly in favour of the catholic church. He worked the land and grew olives, figs and grapes. He wasn't a man that showed affection to either his wife or children and although he put the fear of God in all of them, my mother speaks of him very fondly.

My grandmother was a Catholic and a kind and gentle woman as I remember her. That doesn't mean she wasn't afraid to scold any one of her 11 children and although my mother speaks of her with the greatest love and respect, she tells me there were times that she knew very well she wasn't in the good books.

They  lived through 2 wars, never had any wealth to speak of and worked hard on the land.

My grandmother lost 6 of 11 children. When the Germans invaded and took over the villages she was forced to flee to Italy for almost 2 years with her children to survive.

My mother left Croatia in her late 20's without a word of English. She was asked to keep company an aunt in Rhodesia who had lost her husband. She would pay for her flight and return and all expenses whilst there but got used to having a servant and refused to pay for my mother to return home.

Eventually she learned English, got a job and met my father.

Although he was an only child and his life was somewhat easier than hers.

My father’s parents also lived through 2 wars in England, both served in the 2nd and worked very hard all their lives. Their families are from lower middle class backgrounds. My real grandfather died in his late 20's from a disease similar to multiple sclerosis I believe. My grandmother remarried to a RAF serviceman she met during the war.

My father grew up relatively comfortably in Cape Town as I did in Perth, Western Australia. Worked consistently all his life and still does at 68, had 3 children of which I am the eldest. We didn’t have a lot but we certainly didn’t go without.

I also work hard. I always have but have not always been successful. Now I have a business that employs 4 people and growing. Things are looking good.

Life doesn't always seem easy for me, stress from work, long hours, a child to raise, high cost of living and so on. A constant battle.

But when I reflect on what my parent and grandparents went through in their lives, I can only be thankful for what I have.

I have learned from their example to be honest, work hard, persistent, consistent, be reliable and do as you say you will.

On my own I have learned that working hard does not lead to success. Education, planning, creativity, ingenuity and a thick skin are good foundations for success.

Young people: open your eyes to the opportunities available to you today. These are a result of our parents, grandparents and great grandparents hard work and sacrifices.

Remember the important things in life and don't take anything for granted.

Anything you have in this world can be taken from you in the blink of an eye.

I don't have some special story for you so I just share you some thoughts, which help me to live and understand this crazy planet.

1.     Boys! Don't be afraid to do something crazy for your girls. If you do something for woman, you will never look foolish in her eyes.

2.     If you want make someone think that he is in love with you, do something scary together. Adrenaline hormones look like love (science proves it).

3.     If you want to hug or kiss someone – do it. I don’t mean strangers on the street;)

4.     Be careful at office parties. Don’t drink a lot.

5.     If you want to do something, but you are waiting for a good moment – you will wait forever. Every moment is good and bad at the same time, start as soon as possible.

6.     Don’t save things for a special case/events/etc. Wear good dress, eat good food. Who knows what will happen tomorrow.

7.     It is easier to get forgiveness than permission. Sorry, mommies:)

8.     Travel as much as you can. Even to the next village. Broaden your mind!

9.     Make plans but be ready to change it. Life is unpredictable!

10. Learn foreign languages. Conversation with people from other countries is one of the best things in the world.

11. Save some money every 1-2 month.

12. Remember – you can’t please everyone. Don’t worry about it, just do your best.

13. If you want to be with someone – make him feel great with you. We all need support and tenderness more than beauty. Unfortunately we often understand it too late. But be sure that these efforts make you happy.

14. At the same time remember – no one will fall in love with your soul from the first sight. Work on your body!

15. Just think about it – every atom in your body was once a part of star.

16. But the other side – all water you drink has been already drunk by someoneJ

17. Trite but true. If you want to do something – you will look for an opportunity, if you just think that you want – you will look for reasons to set it aside.

18. Sorry for my poor English;)

January 2013,08,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/01/08/be-honest-with-yourself/,"January 2013, 08",Be honest with yourself,"2012 was a rough year for me - losing my house, car, credit rating, shifting around friends' places and wasting a bunch of time recovering from technical issues.

It was the culmination of years of almost-sensible decisions. I offer one suggestion to avoid this:

Be honest with yourself.

Look in the mirror every morning and ask ""what truth am I hiding from?""

Here are some ways I've been dishonest with myself:=> Living like I was close to great entrepreneurial success with really I had no plan.=> Spending more than I was earning: You don't *need* anything except food and used clothing.=> Enduring a non-constructive relationship - telling yourself ""marriage is for life"" doesn't make it any happier. Inevitably you'll end up compensating in other ways.=> Focusing on *appearing* successful rather than *being* successful. Who's ""meaningful"" was I trying to achieve?=> Believing ""I'm special"" thus ignoring the logical advice of friends & mentors.

This is all obvious stuff. Reaching me as ""advice"" it didn't digest deep enough. I needed to experience the painful consequences of not ""living"" it to appreciate in hindsight how I failed to thoroughly practice it.

I'm working hard to be honest in the mirror. Honest with people around me and inviting honesty.

2013 is kicking off without the outward symbols of success I held onto so tightly before, but I feel better about myself than ever.

Happy new year friends.

    Winter's Tale is set in a fantastic version of New York City around    the    20th century. There is a great wall of clouds, in which time and    space seem    to work differently. There is a white horse, which jumps so far that    it    starts to fly. A beautiful but terminally ill girl which has    uncovered the    secret formulas of the universe.

January 2013,06,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/01/06/its-the-little-things/,"January 2013, 06",It's the little things,"When I first received the email saying I won the Listserve lottery, I honestly had no idea what to do. I’ll admit I initially joined the Listserve quite selfishly because I just wanted to read the stories of others. Having read every email that came in, and seeing all the life lessons and creativity pouring from every single one of them, I was left quite dismayed. What could I write about? What could I possibly put into words that others would want to read? I've probably started this about 12 times but I think I know what to say now.

My name is Keegan. I am a 4th year college student pursuing a BS degree in Chemistry, graduating in May, 21 years old, caught somewhere between a woman and a girl, and currently writing to you all in the comfort of a blanket fort.

You see, I've had kind of a terrible day today. It started out by dropping someone very dear to me off at the airport and, as I’m sure most of you know, that leads to quite the difficult day. Especially when things have been left unresolved and you won’t see them again until July. That, coupled with the fact classes will be starting again soon and not really anyone is back from break yet, has led to some serious moping around.

Now I’m not really the kind of person to make new years resolutions, but considering I received the email saying I won the Listserve lottery on January 1st, I figured that now seemed like a pretty good time to do so.

So here they are: short, sweet, simple.

Be more confident.

Smile more.

Enjoy the little things.

That brings me to my current location. I was perusing the internet, scrolling through countless pages and getting to that point of actually being bored with just sitting in bed being upset. I was thinking to myself, what can make me happy? What can get me out of this rut? And then it hit me. Blanket fort. I sat there for about a minute or two just thinking about it saying to myself, “Come on, Keegan. You can’t actually make a fort. Think of something practical.” But then I thought, “Why not?.... Why can’t I? I’m enough of an adult to say that I can do what I want and right now, I want a blanket fort.” And thus, construction began.

It took me about 7 minutes to work out my happy place here. My comforter strung from my bed, to my desk, to my bookshelf. A sheet between the footboard and mirror leaning on the wall, forming the tunnel to my escape. Textbooks holding everything down. I added a chair in the middle, creating a sort of tent like appearance and even took my bedside lamps into the fort for lighting. The final touch came in throwing all my remaining blankets and pillows inside and falling into them in pure happiness.

I felt like a little kid but my night has been instantly better since.

So why am I telling all of you this? I want you to think about this when you are feeling down. When you've had a rough day and just feel like you've reached that quitting point. Remember that you should always take a minute or two to just do something for yourself to make yourself happy, because you’ll never be too old for such things. Whether you take the long way home through the park, get an extra scoop of ice-cream, or build yourself a blanket fort, I challenge you to not neglect the little things that will keep you going through 2013.

Please email me! Let me know how you've taken up my challenge or even if you just want to talk about anything and everything. I’m always looking for ways to brighten up the days of the people around me. Happy New Year everybody!!

Cheers.

A little bit about me – I live in New York City, work for an internet startup (Hi, Chartbeat!), and have a Great Dane named Lucy (Lucyfur when she’s bad).

What you won’t get in this email: 1) Wide ranging life advice. Hell, I can’t even figure my out my own life. 2) The first chapter of my unpublished novel.  I can barely finish this email. 3) A list of platitudes. Instead, let’s just go with the flow.  ;-)

What you will get: 1) Random life advice. I can do random! 2) Photos of every situation I mention below. If you go to bit (dot) ly (slash) dawnlistserve or go to flickr and search for the user “dawnlistserve” you can see a picture of everything I talk about below.  3) I’m not sure there is a #3, to be honest. Good karma? Great Dane kisses?

Anyway, here goes:

I weigh 105 pounds. My dog weighs 120. Here are some questions you shouldn’t ask a big dog owner:    - Does he come with a saddle?    - Are you walking him or is he walking you?    - How do you like owning a horse? Best question I’ve ever received (from a child):    - Is that your pet cow? Best question I’ve ever received (from an adult):    - Is that a puma?

Telling your NBA-crazy high school girlfriends that you were chosen from amongst a huge group of people to work courtside for an entire Phoenix Suns season was pretty cool. Explaining to your adult colleagues that you were a really great ‘ball girl’ in high school? Uh, not so much.

If you ever visit the FBI building in Washington D.C. and you see an “Exit” sign that doesn’t look quite right and no one else is using it, don’t go through the door. Unless you want to get stuck in a 2- x 3-foot construction barrier for 20 minutes.   But… if this does happen to you, the fastest way to get armed security guards to help you find the real exit is to try to scale the exterior wall, get stuck on the top of it, and rip your pants on the way down.  Seriously, those guys can move pretty fast when they want to.

If you ever find yourself in India for a wedding (Hi, Mona!) and you’ve managed to make it the first 11 days of the trip without getting even the tiniest bit sick, don’t get cocky on day 12 and encourage your traveling companion (Hi, Ted!) to drink a glass of freshly squeezed pineapple juice from the hotel breakfast buffet right before the wedding.

Finally, sometimes you just have to share a photo of your little sister (Hi, Nicole!) with the world so everyone can appreciate it. And I swear the selection has nothing to do with all the years of you teasing, biting, and constantly wanting to hang out with me and my friends.

Thanks for indulging me, everyone! If you write me at  or tweet at me @justsoyouknow, I’ll respond. Pinky swear! xoxo

January 2013,04,https://thelistservearchive.com//2013/01/04/who-are-you/,"January 2013, 04",Who Are You?,"My name is John. I am a computer programmer living in NYC working with close friends at a startup fashion company called StyleSays.com. Looking back, my life has constantly evolved and changed; I was born in South Korea and I've lived everywhere from North Carolina to Australia. Growing up I was very self aware, especially when entering new schools and making new friends. I constantly wondered, ""who am I?"" I know that my name is John and I like pizza but what actually makes up the person that I am when I wake up each morning?

As I grew older, my thoughts focused first on school and then work, and I lost my awareness. Two days ago I woke to a message saying I had been selected for the Listserve. I was both ecstatic and terrified. It took me a few hours to remember the question I grew up pondering: who am I?

To answer that question, I defined the elements of life that make up who I am. I broke it down into three areas, though you may have more or less and I'd love to hear from you. That's how we can all help each other grow.

1. Passion - Everyone has a passion or at least a desire to find their passion. As a teenager I tried many different things hoping to discover an activity, cause, or study that consumed me. Overtime I realized that I was infatuated with technology and fashion (this was long before the iPhone and cases by Marc Jacobs). After studying computer science for 6 years I began looking for ways to mix my passions. In my last year of grad school at Stanford I began working on a way to greatly improve the way people shop online I wanted to make fashion more accessible to people all over the world. And I could not make such a drastic impact on the world working as employee number ten thousand; I needed to start a company.

2. People - Even before starting my own company, I knew that I could not achieve my goals by myself. Again using my startup as an example, I was lucky enough to meet similar minded people who pushed me to work harder and find ways to succeed even during the hardest times. It is now very clear to me that I could not possibly achieve what I did without hardworking friends by my side. Recently we were finally able to make our visions a reality; StyleSays is now a platform to help lovers of fashion to find the items they see in online photos. I couldn’t be more proud of the team we built.

3. Surroundings - For me this is the most important element. With so many country, school, and city changes I was constantly having to adapt, and to me adaptation is new opportunities to grow as a person. Today I find myself sitting in an open loft in downtown Manhattan working with a close group of friends on a company, on a mission that I'm proud and excited to take on. New York has been crucial in shaping my current self and I've grown so much in a short amount of time in this amazing city.

I encourage you to learn more about your passions, connect with amazing people, and constantly change your environment.

So the question remains: who am I? I am a motivated young man with amazing friends and partners who is passionate about making people's lives better through technology. I am John Yu.

Who are you?

There we sat. Jean jackets and mullets. Acne and ennui. Begrudgingly studying the many spheres: biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, whateversphere.

This day concerned a simpler sphere – a ball – and the effect of the earth upon it. We were learning about gravity.

The teacher – nice guy but stern – explained that, thanks to the nature of gravity, and potential and kinetic energy, a ball cannot bounce as high as the height from which it's dropped. You've seen this countless times. Each bounce has a successively lower apex until the thing peters out and comes to rest.

As he explained this, a magnificent thought took shape in my mind. I was 14 with a chip on my shoulder. I didn't like rules. And here before me, all around me, was one big fat whopper of a rule. An irrefutable, fundamental fact of the universe: GRAVITY.

I raised my hand and, with a casualness inversely proportional to the magnitude of my claim, said, ""I disagree. I think it can bounce higher.""

There were laughs, and the teacher wasn't having it. ""No really,"" I said, ""I can do it. I'll bring a ball tomorrow and show you.""

Now, this is no story of magic or delusion. Physics is Physics. I couldn't possibly alter the nature of gravity. But I could, and did, alter the operational definition of a ball. And so that night I applied myself to the construction of the greatest ball ever made.

The heart of it was a standard helium balloon, around which I paper-mached a sphere of newspaper. The balloon's tapered shape left a cavity inside the bottom of the sphere, within which I placed a raw egg as ballast, nestling it in a hole cut into the nadir of the sphere.

When finished it was a big, unwieldy, misshapen thing. A busted Death Star. Yet also: an audacious invention. An engineering marvel. And a brazen exercise in cheating. I was proud.

Next day I stood before the class and held it aloft. No one knew anything of its innards. I must've looked clownish. The teacher was pure skepticism and annoyance. But there I stood, reveling in the virtue of defiance.

I released it.

I hadn't tested it, so I was going on faith. The weight of the egg took it down slowly and I wondered if it would hit hard enough to crack that sucker open and release its yolky ballast. Slowly it sank. Long seconds went by. And finally, as gravity brought the thing to the ground, truth and the moment collided.

CRRRITCH…

It rested several moments as the egg leaked out, then tentatively began pulling away from its snotty deposit. Slowly it rose, trailing yolk and albumen. Quicker then. Up. Up past my knees. Passing my chest, my head. Up past as high as my hands could reach. Up past the origin of its fall. Up to the ceiling, where it bounced, petered out, and finally came to rest.

I don't remember the class's reaction. Only the teacher's. He dismissed it outright. It didn't count. It was cheating.

He was right.

But he'd failed to learn the lessons taught in class that day. That ingenuity arises in the face of impossibility. That a thing is not always what it seems. That some things you can't change, but what you do with them is another story.

And that when things fall down, bounce back higher however the hell you want to.

Today, be a blasphemer. Hug a heretic. After you read this, go slay some sacred cows. But, get this right, you're not to pick the easy ones - not the fat, bow-legged, short-sighted cows, the thick fillets-on-four-legs already cosying up to the butcher. The ones you want to hunt down will be trim, lively, prize-specimen sacred cows. Hell, slaughter a farm of them. Skin them, roast them over a low fire and let them cook through. Turn out a line of leather jackets.

You have much choice. Religions are of course bountiful hunting grounds, but today you'll want to pursue the more unsuspecting of cherished beliefs. Plumb the depths of your community's moral presumptions, find a principle too valuable to question and turn it on its head, renounce it, cut it up. Be analytical or be brash, subtle or vulgar.

Will this make you feel happy or inspired? Unlikely. Will it give your life new meaning or help you find yourself? Hopefully not. But it will certainly make 2013 begin on an interesting note.

A short fantasy story with a true heart and message, written by myself many a year ago, when my life was much more complicated, restless and chaotic. I wrote this one for a close friend who needed a positive message at the time, but now, looking back at it all, I think I could've just as easily have written it for myself. Since then, you should know, my state of being has been transformed from being unsure, insecure and unaware, to being genuinely happy, secure, cognizant and reasonably untroubled. How, you might ask? Well, it turned out to be fairly simply / incredibly difficult: by finding true love and by finding (part of) my true self...

********

Chacaroc’hcracha-cocrochy lived in an old abandoned gnome dwelling at the foot of a ridiculously gigantic and, in addition, awfully ancient oak tree, covered in strange smelling dark greenish mold. Chacaroc’hcracha-cocrochy (I’m really terribly sorry, but that’s just what she was called) looked very much like a cockroach, but, to be honest, she actually wasn’t one and, for that matter, never had been one either. She herself had no idea though, of what she actually was and why she did look like what she looked like. No idea about the extraordinary forces that quietly bubbled within her either.

The thing is, Chacaroc’hcracha-cocrochy was in fact the only existing creature in existence that perceived Chacaroc’hcracha-cocrochy as an ‘ugly creepy crawly creeper’, as she indeed often mumblingly referred herself to. Obviously, there was no one around to tell her otherwise, being the only Earthborn in that particular part of the forest (throughout that particular span of time that we now so whimsically, or rather ironically, denote as ""Origin"" or ""Chacaroc’hcracha-cocrochy"").

Yes, this is true; she had once met Garwocketwicket, Garwocketwicket the gnome. He was a surprisingly mute gnome, however, only able to communicate with birds (or other animals with beaks that whistled) by mimicking their cries and colourful tunes, simultaneously flapping his arms and legs. A strange sight for some perhaps, but Chacaroc’hcracha-cocrochy, by her very nature, understood immediately and perfectly that a gnome being a mute gnome, communicating with birds and at the same time comically flapping his limbs, probably was the most beautiful spectacle she would ever had the privilege to witness.

Never before had mute creatures told Chacaroc’hcracha-cocrochy that she was not what she thought she was. Neither did Garwocketwicket, nor did he want to if he could have done so. Which is to say, not in a direct or literal manner at any rate. As an owlish gnome of strong character and stupendous wisdom he kept himself to flapping his arms and legs, creating beautiul spectacles and letting Chacaroc’hcracha-cocrochy be Chacaroc’hcracha-cocrochy. Knowing she would undoubtedly one day see herself as her true self, knowing that she would one day see and feel the extraordinary forces that so quietly bubbled within her.

Saturday, July 4

The first fireworks exploded over the Mississippi as I ran through the alley behind my own house. I didn’t know the exact intentions of the man chasing me, but the gun and the yelling and the broken window he’d left at Elise’s place led me to believe that he wasn’t trying to return misdelivered mail.

As another fiery bloom took shape over the water, I paused for a split second to check on his progress. Just before the BOOM, I caught a glimpse of him silhouetted in red, exuding anger even though I couldn’t see his face. As the light faded, he turned toward my back porch, and I swore to myself; I’d been hoping to steal into my house and figure out what the hell to do next, but if he was heading that way, my plans were going to have to change.

And then I saw him passing my house with a single disinterested look, his eyes focused on the corners and the exits.

Shit.

He’d seen me. My plans were going to have to change fast.

Fortunately, my small scraggly side yard butted up against an auto repair shop, and I knew where there was a flap in the fence. The head mechanic had cut it out last summer so his wife’s unlovable pair of yap-dogs could sneak out and shit on my property instead, and I figured I was well within my rights to use it myself. I made my way to the appropriate section of fence, hoping against hope that the grand finale wasn’t in the offing; I crouched, pushed the corner, and wriggled onto their asphalt, leaving nothing but a big heaping pile of my dignity behind, and opening onto a lot of lousy options.

The expanse of parking lot between me and the garage was exposed, well-lit against thieves and undoubtedly covered by some kind of alarm; I was about as likely to be able cross Lake Ponchartrain in my t-shirt and jeans. I could have potentially made a sprint for the little front office, but it was about the size of a phone booth, and I didn’t relish standing in a shooting gallery.

I figured my best chance at hiding was the line of cars just to my left. There were four or five in various states of disrepair and they weren’t all that opaque, but I could get behind them in a couple strides and reassess what had gone wrong with my life.

And so I took a deep breath, mentally measured the distance to the beat-to-hell green Camry closest to me, closed my eyes and tried to steel the shaking in my knees long enough to walk over without my teeth chattering and giving me away.

It took four steps. Each one of them seemed to last a damn eternity, but the only explosions that punctuated the sultry New Orleans night were those from the fireworks display. As I settled in behind the Camry’s wheel well, nothing shot yet but my nerves, I had to laugh to myself.

I’d had a lot of lousy rebound relationships. But this was the first one that was about to get me killed.

December 2012,29,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/12/29/if-you-ever-get-bored-just-open-your-eyes/,"December 2012, 29","If you ever get bored, just open your eyes","I have two young sons, aged 2 and 4 and before they were born I started to make a list of things they might find useful as they grew up. I keep adding to it, but thought I'd share a few to my fellow listservers. You won't find any 'live as if every day is your last' or 'follow your dreams' because for me they don't add anything. If anyone has others to add, then email me and I'll send then all I receive to those who submitted!

1. If you ever get bored, just open your eyes: This is a great reminder for me that we normally stumble around the world on automatic mode, missing so much around us. It's a reminder to stop now and then, especially when bored, to look around and try to see things that you may have not seen before. This also reminded me of a great quote by the late hypnotherapist, Milton Erickson: ""have you ever noticed that every blade of grass is a different shade of green?"". it still amazes me that simply asking yourself this question directly affects your perceptual system. Highly recommend books by Harvard prof, Ellen Langer on western scholastic mindfulness which will blow your mind (start with the power of mindful learning).

2. You rarely need more time, but more time limits: I've been my most productive when I've only had a limited time to complete things. I did my Masters, another course of study and worked managing a college (= available all hours) all at the same time, and really had to partition out my time. I would have struggled if they were at separate times in my life. This links with another one, ""self imposed discipline is always better than forced upon you"".

3. Anyone can be creative: so many people go to their graves thinking they don't have a creative bone in their bodies. I teach creativity and there are three enduring myths: you have to be born creative; creativity is only for those in the Arts & you have to wait for creativity to strike. All are unnecessary and crap! Instead I believe that: creativity is a set of techniques, which can be learnt by anyone in any industry/background, and can be employed at any time. Highly recommend the books by Edward De bono, especially ""Serious Creativity"".he recycles his ideas but this is the best book to smash these myths.

4. Compassion starts with seeing how we are similar: those of us reading this are better off than most people in the world. Compassion and gratitude for me go hand in hand and I've enjoyed reading some of the arising works/research on positive psychology. Simple implementation: start writing three new things you're grateful for at the end of each day. Agreed, it sounds a little light and fluffy, but I found it makes me more resilient in the day as it forces you to actively seek out what's good in your life. Check out Shawn Achor's TED Talk for a simple introduction.

5. Enjoy the journey because you'll never get there: this is hugely important.too many people work towards Imagined happiness rather than trying to live it day to day. Happiness should come first: it makes everything much easier

6. Arrogance is weakness: simple as that. Pity the arrogant and pretentious, it's all just a wank.

There's more but I'm limited by time and words. Happy to receive any from you.who knows, yours may be the one that changes my boys' lives!!

Thanks for your time.

Next week, next month, someday I was going to start doing it. And even though the vast majority of my free time goes into my music, to this day I haven’t started playing out.

But I’ve done what I think is the next best thing. Around the time that I signed up for the The Listserve, I started a project called Absinthe and OJ (.com). And that’s what I wanted to show everyone. The idea behind it is to get whatever I come up with recorded and online without thinking about it too much. Then once it’s out there, I can get feedback and post new revisions. I’m still in the phase of getting down first takes of all of the stuff I have written and I have a looong way to go, so there haven’t been too many revisions. There also hasn’t been too much feedback… I have under 300 listens on my SoundCloud account. (And lets not talk about how many of those are from me…)

So it would be really awesome if you could take a look at what I’ve got so far and let me know what you think. You can comment on specific parts of the SoundCloud clip or send me an email. Either way, I’d love to hear from you, and feel free to be as brutal as you like. The more people tear my work apart, hopefully the better it’ll be someday.

Thanks and happy holidays,

Shaun Connecticut

PS: I put together a 7 track EP of what I think is my best stuff so far.  All of the songs can be streamed from SoundCloud or YouTube, but if you like what you hear, you can get the EP from Google Play (if Google's review process finishes in time?). Or if you ask me, I’d probably just give it to you…

PPS: If absintheandoj dot com goes down, it’s probably just out of utter shock and confusion that someone other than myself and a small handful of friends are looking. Hopefully it’ll get over it, but if not you can search for absintheandoj on SoundCloud or shaunr88 on YouTube."
December 2012,27,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/12/27/the-fear-of-no/,"December 2012, 27","The fear of ""No""","I'm a photojournalist, which means that I get to meet and talk to a lot of people that I normally wouldn't. I love it. But as an introvert it can sometimes be difficult for me to ask people for permission to let me into their lives. 

Some times I'm around a subject for mere moments and the assignment is complete, other times it takes me days/weeks to complete a story, which means spending a lot of time with the person. I have come to find that when I know that I'm only going to be around someone for a short period of time it's easier for me to ask if I can photograph them because I am able to convince myself that it doesn't matter what they think of me because I am likely never to see them again. 

It is subjects that I have to return to multiple times in order to complete a story that I have a more difficult time with. I begin to worry about what they will think of me, and that they will not want to be photographed and followed around, and that they will find me to be a nuisance. All of these worries create a fear that can sometimes be paralyzing. Most of the time I just suck it up and ask if I can photograph them anyways, but I know there have been moments where I have let integral storytelling moments pass me by because I kept my mouth shut. 

After expressing my frustrations over my worries to a mentor, she said to me ""you already have the no, why not go for the yes?"" That simple phrase stopped me in my tacks. It made so much sense to me, why hadn't I thought of it before?!  If you don't ask the answer will always be ""no!""  But if you take a chance you just might get the ""yes"" that you are looking for. I have also come to learn that ""no"" doesn't always necessarily mean ""no"", sometimes it means ""not right now."" Sometimes a ""no"" can lead you down a path that you never would have imagined yourself on had you received your ""yes"". And sometimes the ""no"" path turns out better than the ""yes"" path. 

I would dare to say that this principle of ""you already have the no"" extends far beyond the world of photojournalism and can be utilized in every aspect of your life. I for one know the principle has opened many doors and lead me to do things that I would normally never do. 

I still struggle occasionally with the principle, but each day I challenge myself to go after the ""yes."" You never know what kind of results you will get until you ask and you will be surprised at how often people will surprise you. So with that I leave you with a challenge: go after that yes and don't let the fear of no stop you! 

I wish you all the best on your journey chasing the ""yes.""

+ The sting of mountain sunlight, while playing checkers outside the Café Girasoles. On the back of the neck, you could feel the burn beginning, a red stripe beneath the pink stripe of the insect bites. The chickens in the field, and the beautiful shadows of the defunct Ferris wheel, angular and so black that they had a little glow around their edges, as around the body of a swimmer seen from the below.

+ Piercingly clear Swiss alpine light gleaming on the breakfast plate like a coiled diamond necklace.

+ Taking a shower in Koenji -- the clatter of bright droplets -- the winter sun, that November, was weak, and gave almost no warmth -- but it filled out the steam and the steam distributed the light 'til the shower was a cube of bright vapor.

+ In the thick high-summer resinous smell of the sage and chaparral and monkey flower. The air very clear, the light hot on the path, pale dust on the leaves of the blackberry tangles and that shimmering out-of-focus glow in the masses of white thistledown scattered in the bushes by the wind. The shock is getting to the top of the ridge, looking out over a sea of bright fog, perfectly opaque and rolling like a plowed field, a prow of fog advancing slowly up into the valley like a ship.

+ At Sagaponack: Montauk daisies, talc-fine sand, and the dazzle of bright light of a very special kind -- cool, not hot; planar rather than diffuse; palpable and not liquid. It descended from the trees to the grass where we walked like a bolt of fabric unrolled.

+ Swimming in cool, deep oakmoss green velvet water after the pine needle, quartzite sun morning. A hand on their boat, feeling like one of the dolphins that leapt by Dionysus's craft, once he revealed himself a god, vine tendrils in the rigging.

+ The little white shed illuminated by the halide floodlight in that night, so bright with the circle of radiance falling rapidly away into the kind of pagan night that comes when Fenrir finally devours the sun. During the day, huge white clouds move slowly across the sky, sometimes trailing thick curtains of gray rain across the floor of the world, rain that lashes the roof of the barn like chains.

+ The gorgeous, burning glow of a milky Arctic sunlight as white as glacier milk. The chirping of a wind turbine spinning in the constant rush of cold air on a farm on the island farthest north. The clouds are fast and very low, it seems, as though drawing close to the place where the sea meets the sky, or everything spills over the edge of the Earth.

+ Lightning bugs flickered and swarmed over the paramo grass in the dark. The clouds began to clear, the hidden stars shining gradually through, first Venus only and then many -- clearer and clearer, vast systems of stars, tangles, clouds of stars. All out to the soft depth of the Milky Way. And on the clouds of the eastern horizon: reflected flashes of lightning, huge, sudden clouds in negative, the glow of lightning over the Amazon.

I think this is a great concept and I'm glad that it got such a great reception. I am really happy to have been chosen but to be honest I'm not particularly well spoken. I'm an artist and just started a job in June making a video game called Mage Faire Online.

This is where things get interesting... I absolutely love it but if it has taught me anything, besides the ridiculous amounts of real world experience I've gotten so far, it is that everything, even your dream job can have ups and downs. It's amazing to think that something that you always want your entire life can have ANYTHING negative to it, but that's life. So, then what did this lead me to realize? Well, it made me realize that happiness is a lot simpler than people think.

Happiness is just that, being happy. The ONLY way to be happy, is to be happy. What I mean is that you should just feel happy about life, things you have, and not worry about the things you don't.

OK, the other secret to happiness is to never listen to someone who says, “Oh, you're going to do “insert cool thing here”? I wish I could do that!” That has ALWAYS driven me crazy. If you want to do something, do it. If you want to live in France for the rest of your life, find a way. There is always an excuse that will stop you from doing this but ignore that. It always seems impossible but it's not. You only have to figure out how. I taught English for 2 years in another country and it was not hard to do. There are people out in the world willing to help you with anything. You just have to use Google ;)

On a personal note, if anyone is Hungarian or speaks Hungarian I have one thing to say, “Mindig a szivem Magyarorszagon lesz!”

I look behind me and there is light. It shines with a great brightness.  I look ahead of me and see: Nothing.  I see darkness and despair, the unknown.  How silly I must look to anyone watching, up here standing between my past and my future.  The bright security of my past illuminates me from behind, making me visible to all I am yet to see.I turn and face the brightness.  How easy it would be to walk back there and stay where I am.  I look over my shoulder and shiver.  Surely the darkened path is steep, uneven and cluttered with debris that will make me fall.  I should just go back down the path I know.  I know it is level and clear.I start down the lighted trail, going back to smiling faces.  First the faces of those I know, faces of love.  The trail is steady and clear.  My past quietly whispers that I should return to the new path.Then I understand.  These are the people I would have, could have, should have met, had I risked the dark, the unknown.  Yet still I walk forward, further on the lighted path. The people of my past and missed future look on with concern, but still they let me continue on.Suddenly, I stumble.  What did I trip over?  There was nothing in the trail last time I was here.  I look, and see that I tripped over my desire to change; it lies here broken and defeated.  I have killed it. But WAIT, it still moves.  I have a chance to revive it.I know what I must do.  I must take it back the other way, into the unknown. I look to the darkness, back the other way. I can’t go there. I continue in the light.In front of me there is a wall, it wasn’t there before.  I look at the wall, and recognize it immediately.  It is a wall of my disappointment.  Disappointment in myself.  I can go around it, but eventually it will appear again.I look back again, at the future I turned away from.  It seems a little brighter, grey now, not black, with light in the distance.  That light; hope, lets me know that the end of the path will bright.I walk toward the grey, and pick up my desire for change.  I look back on my familiar path.  Sure, it was a nice path, but I am done with it now.  Clearly I cannot go back that way.  I must continue on.So here I am.  At the edge again, with the light at my back and the unknown trail ahead.  In my hands is the desire to change. I hesitate.. Is this my last chance to turn back?  No, but I am going to keep going on the unfamiliar path.  How can I turn back and kill a part of me?I take that first step forward, and the path ahead seems to lighten, just a bit.  I tell myself not to look back, and take another step. The light brightens more.My desire for change has been revived, and become a part of me.  I know what is behind me, but ahead of me lay new challenges and excitement.  I will go forward, knowing that I am not leaving my old path.So to my old path, goodbye for now.  To my new path: Ready or not Here I Come!

This quest to find beauty and peace, led me to an intriguing and unexpected job: a designer in the university’s center for teaching and learning (HEDC). There, I learned that design and teaching are not far apart at all.

The design thinking process is devoted to solving complex challenges in creative and practical ways. The world of teaching is filled with complex challenges, from finding ways to explain difficult concepts, through to designing a curriculum, or helping students experience a topic rather than be told about what it is.

Collaborating with my colleague, Dr. Clinton Golding, an educational philosopher, we began teaching lecturers how to solve their challenges using the framework and the tools we developed. They found it useful and reinvigorating, and reported a positive change in their practice.

I recently moved back to my family in Israel. Now, I work with businesses to implement innovation in their organizations using design thinking. With that, I didn’t leave NZ and education behind me. Clinton and I are in the final stages of writing our book: Reinvigorating Teaching using the Design Thinking Framework. We hope it’ll continue to support teachers around the world to find creative and practical solutions for their teaching.

Thanks for the opportunity to share my life with you. I’d love to hear from you.

Perhaps to cross something off the ""bucket list,"" to prove to others/self, to maintain a healthy lifestyle, to have fun, the possibilities are endless. My quest to 26.2 miles began three years ago, just to say I could. At least, that's what I thought.

Ten years ago I tried to kill myself. Not in the teenage angst suicide type way - I was diagnosed with anorexia when I was fourteen.

I firmly believe that eating disorders are not a sole result of media and social pressure, rather a mental disease. I had no idea the harm I was inflicting upon myself. I did not understand why I was banned from playing soccer, riding my horse, dancing, things that brought joy to my life. My life seemed chaotic and food/eating was the only thing I could control.

Clearly, as I write this to you, I survived my sickness - a miracle, but that is a story for another time.

Through training for this past September’s TNF Endurance Challenge Trail Marathon in Madison, WI, I realized I did not just want to complete a marathon; I needed to complete a marathon. Every mile pounded away demons of the past. Every sore muscle gave way into gladness for being strong. Every step of anguish brought tears of joy for being alive. I needed to prove to my disease that, ten years later, it no longer owned me. When I crossed the finish line, 5 hours and 25 minutes after I started, I broke down in tears; I had never felt more free.

Eating disorders are incredibly misunderstood. If you/someone you know is currently struggling, please contact me. I am more than happy to listen, chat, love, help.

I have 2 things to share with you that are important to me, and that I hope some of you will join in with.

Read And Find Out (.com) I've been part of an online community for over a decade that started around a series of fantasy books (The Wheel of Time) and has since grown into something much more broadly geeky, with a dash of the eccentric, and I love it. I've met many excellent people through it (online and irl) from all over and there’s nothing quite like being amongst My People. The internet is neat, huh?  The community wouldn't exist without these lovely people though so if you like fantasy, sci fi, books in general, or any other gubbins that you feel like chatting about to randoms online, come and say hello - we're at Read And Find Out .com and newbies are delicious.

Coding In another flavour of geek, I've not long started my first proper tech job (they pay me to code! haha!) and could do with some kind of mentor - if you have some free time and any experience with PHP especially, but also Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, as well as good, efficient and secure ways of coding, and don't mind being inundated with questions - email!

Ok, I'm done. You should count yourselves lucky - the temptation to Rickroll all of you is *almost* overwhelming.

I took 2 weeks holiday from my regular job in order to help at Wembley Stadium, where 9 matches of the men's and women's football tournament were played. I loved meeting spectators and volunteers from all over the world and was proud to welcome visitors to my country.

I'll always remember and be inspired by the way that the Olympians embraced the competition, realised life long dreams and found years of hard work finally paying off.

You find me today as I fulfill a life long dream of my own. I make computer games for a living and this evening (December 12th), a product I've worked on is being released to the public for the first time. It's been a long road to this point; I've worked through university, broken in to the industry and suffered the heartbreak of cancelled projects. Today, I look back on it all and feel very grateful to the family that raised me, my partner who supports me every day and the friends and colleagues that I've learned so much from.

December 2012,18,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/12/18/in-opportune/,"December 2012, 18",(In)opportune,"A long time ago, I was hit with a sudden fever on my way home. As I came out of the subway, I felt so sick I could barely keep my eyes open, and the ten minute walk to my door (in the rain) seemed unfathomable. As I dragged myself down the street, I was consumed with self pity, and didn't notice the two children near me, splashing in puddles, until one jumped up close to me, spraying me with muddy water.

""Watch what the fuck you're doing!"" I snapped at them, my anger suddenly as hot as my fever. The children, drew back and apologized. I composed myself, and gave one of my own. ""I'm sorry, I shouldn't have sworn at you, but please be more careful next time"". My head swimming, I turned and headed home. The kids followed. ""Do you live around here?"" they asked, and suddenly we were having a conversation about the neighborhood, their school, their friends. Before I knew it, we were at my corner. We said goodbye, parted ways, and I never saw them again.

I am still deeply thankful to those kids. On what could have been a long march home, instead of feeling weak and disoriented and sorry for myself, they kept me distracted, and the trip flew by. I had no idea how much I needed it until it was offered to me. It can hard for me to remember to be open to people, especially when they make mistakes, just as I know how hard it can be to see what's going right when everything seems to be going wrong. That moment, like so many others in my life, was a reminder to give life the opportunity to show me what to be thankful for.

I'll end this with a shoutout to a group of people that always threw opportunity my way, my second family, a college/community radio station in Montréal called CJLO 1690AM. For over a decade, CJLO has let me contribute to and be part of something bigger than myself, and for that, I will forever be thankful. I would also be remiss to not thank Renata and Andrew, two people who, in their individual ways, give me the chance to be a better person every single day.

And finally, thank you to YOU, whoever you are, wherever you are in the world. You make someone's day better every day, and you might not even know it.

“Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.” - Carl Sagan

The brain is too amazing and too capable to be wasted on hate.

Secondly, a story as part of Bill Bryson's book A Short History of Nearly Everything:

[Discussing the international scientific venture to measure the transit of Venus from different spots on the globe to determine the distance of the Earth from the Sun.  The story concerns one man’s hapless plight in 1761.]

“[Guillaume] Le Gentil set off from France a year ahead of time to observe the transit from India, but various setbacks left him still at sea on the day of the transit -- just about the worst place to be since steady measurements were impossible on a pitching ship.         Undaunted, Le Gentil continued on to India to await the next transit in 1769.  With eight years to prepare, he erected a first-rate viewing station, tested and retested his instruments and had everything in a state of perfect readiness.  On the morning of the second transit, June 4, 1769, he awoke to a fine day, but just as Venus began its pass, a cloud slid in front of the Sun and remained there for almost exactly the duration of the transit:  three hours, fourteen minutes, and seven seconds.         Stoically, Le Gentil packed up his instruments and set off for the nearest port, but en route he contracted dysentery and was laid up for nearly a year.  Still weakened, he finally made it onto a ship.  It was nearly wrecked in a hurricane off the African coast.  When at last he reached home, eleven and a half years after setting off, and having achieved nothing, he discovered that his relatives had had him declared dead in his absence and had enthusiastically plundered his estate.”

A very wise woman said these words to me, and I have breathed them in ever since.

If you have that desire—that spark—to dedicate a minute, an hour, a day, or your life to learning, amazing things can and will change. This doesn’t mean sitting in a classroom and listening to lectures, this means immersing yourself in new situations, new places, new conversations, and new perspectives.

I plan to live with this mindset for the rest of my life. The smallest changes in my daily routine teach me so much; I have learned from these experiences and learned to take bigger, and bigger risks.

Listen to This American Life, eat a chocolate mousse cake for a snack, be a Buddhist for a day, move to Indonesia, backpack, read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime over and over again, laugh too often, cry even more, smile, befriend a stranger, embarrass yourself, swap music with a friend, speak Mandarin, compliment somebody for no reason, learn.

Share this mindset. And share it with me. Tell me your stories, how to learn, who to learn from, what to learn, and what I can teach others.

In the wise words of the very same woman, “Sharing is the second hardest thing in life, the first is finding people to share with.”

I’ll admit it, I’m basically anti-social.  I’ve struggled with it my whole life.  I am 27 now, and I feel that I should be less pessimistic, but I’m not.  I have a support system of family and a fiancé who “get” me.  But, I have no friends of my own, though I don’t think I’m a total freak.  I have two modes, I either open up completely to people who I shouldn’t because I see them as “different” or I dismiss people who I think are too “normal”.  I don’t know why I have a need to connect on a deep level.  It’s my eternal struggle and I just wanted to share it…

I lost my cousin earlier this year.  He was 23.  I wish he could have stuck around to become the person I know he was.  I put my cat down on Saturday.  I’ve had him ½ of my life.  I miss you guys.

I perform improv in Chicago.  My fiancé speculated that people in the comedy / improv community are probably more in tune to when people are depressed, etc. and are more likely to address it, because we either are / or have dealt with it at some point.  And…I agree.  I’m shy to a fault and I got into improv, begrudgingly, and honestly it is refreshing, I would love to get kids dealing with depression involved in it.

1) Each breath you take shares about 5 air molecules with Hitler's last breath. The equation to verify that yourself (assuming Hitler's last breath has evenly mixed with the rest of the atmosphere by now) is:

       Number of shared molecules = volume of lungs / volume of atmosphere * molecules inhaled per breath

Those three numbers are (roughly): 1 liter, 5 * 10^21 liters, and 3 * 10^22 molecules

If that bothers you, feel free to replace ""Hitler"" with ""Gandhi"" or ""Jesus."" If it doesn't bother you, replace ""breath"" with ""glass of water"" and ""Hitler"" with ""dinosaur pee.""

2) It's possible to cut a sphere into 5 pieces and rearrange the pieces to make two spheres as big as the original. Google the Banach-Tarski paradox. The catch is that the cuts are bizarre, infinitely complex cuts, so you can't do it in real life. I don't get it, but it's true.

3) You can say with absolute certainty that at least 2 non-bald people in New York City have exactly the same number of hairs on their head. The argument centers on the fact that people have about 100,000 hairs, which is fewer than the ~8 million people in NYC. For more details, google the pigeonhole principle. 

I also suspect that there *have* been two snowflakes that have been (almost) exactly alike, but that's just me being crazy.

I love her to death and don’t know where I would be without her.

She became a single mother when my dad was killed. I was a baby. She didn’t crumble but fought back. My family’s life hasn’t been easy but she’s managed to put me through an Ivy League University and support me in my current quest of attending medical school.

I realize now that I should have entered her in some of those contests. Sometimes, private recognition isn’t enough. So, here it is – her recognition. This isn’t a contest and she’s not going to win a prize but you knowing is enough.

Standing in line at a coffee shop? Wherever you are, you will always be there. Wherever you were an hour ago, that ""you"" will always be there. Every moment exists in time. Think about it. It then follows that whatever you will be doing in the future....is already happening. Take it however you wish (""What about free will?""), but think about the novelty of it; specifically, what it means to be ""in the past.""

You will always be sitting at your desk. Or on your couch. This very second -- the one right now -- now -- ......now -- of you reading this sentence, remains. Forever. Sorry if you think it was wasted. But you (and I) will forever be sitting in front of a computer at work  or stuck in traffic or saying goodbye to a friend  or preparing for surgery or some kind of therapy or going through a bad breakup or holding in a heavy, dark secret.

That breath you just took? You'll be breathing in for all eternity, in a sense.

 Now doesn't that make you feel sick.

 But you have to remember that everything exists somewhere in time. That includes the day I made a fool of myself in class and broke out of my shell; the best present you were ever given as a kid; the best end-of-finals party ever thrown; the day I found out he liked me at all; that reassuring phone call; the day she decided to spend time with you instead of him;  all those days before taking on that secret.

Sometimes, I have to focus on the past to remember who I am as a person. My grandparents are all young and happy at one point or another, however short-lived their childhoods may have been. She's gone now, but Nicole exists somewhere in time as my first friend in high school, and will always be walking up to me to say hello.  I am still perched on the steps of Casa Malaparte with a sketchbook. I am literally running -- racing my friends and teachers -- through the streets of Istanbul with the prayer calls from the mosques are echoing around me. I am a baby playing in the creek by my aunt's house; I can barely walk on my own. I am wading by myself halfway across the stream, searching for interesting rocks. I am taking a series of pictures by the water and proclaiming my wedding vows on a nearby hill (which won't happen until 2014, assuming the world won't end on the 21st).

It's what happened before that shaped me. It's the thought of their eternal existence that continues to have an effect on me. If I linger on the subject too much, I begin to feel closed in and surrounded by everything that has ever happened; all the people that used to live in this house, all the big trees that used to be seeds; all the papers and posters on the walls that were printed in rooms far away from me.... Yet at the same time, it's comforting to know that I am part of the fabric of time and place; I contribute to our entire history and future.

I am always utterly aware of where and when I am. I am now. I am then. I am, then.

Anyway, if you really read all of this (I know it's long, I'm sorry), thank you for the opportunity to email you all.

Carpe diem; strive for the impossible; yes, you can; just do it! These are noble suggestions and aspirations and true in the sense that yes, the world is your oyster, and you can change it to suit your dreams. I've experienced this too: push the world in a certain direction and you'll find that it will move.

However. I've recently been struggling with something I find difficult to put into words – the idea that sometimes, no you can't. This is in part trying to escape the tyranny of the overachiever, the idea that _only_ a life lived full steam is a life worth living. But mostly it's the simple fact that much as I'd like to permanently experience the state of Flow, much as I'd like to incessantly spread love and enthusiasm in my life, most of the time I can't.

I don't mean to sound cynical or depressed, nor need cheering up (like I said, I agree with the principle of You Can Do It). Just that, to quote Stephen Fry, that while the key to happiness might be to stop feeling sorry for yourself, ""It's not easy to stop feeling sorry for yourself – it's bloody hard.""

I guess what I'm getting at is to give yourself – and others! – a break for not saving the world today. But never stop trying.

This happens more often than it should. I’m a college senior studying film and journalism; in essence, I’m building myself up for a career of words, yet I often struggle to use them.

Right now it is a horrible 35 degrees (95 Fahrenheit) and I’m very jealous of all those in the Northern Hemisphere celebrating the beginning of winter.

It was about a year ago now since I joined The Listserve and I had just finished school, and was about to start my first year at University. I remember being terrified about my future, I was about to start a new stage of my life and yet I had no idea where I was headed. Now, after one year, I have a stronger view on what I want to do with my life, even though it’s completely different to what I had first thought! So hopefully, in 4 years time, I’ll be finished University and starting out as a Spanish Teacher. (If anyone reading this is from Spain, I plan to visit here in 2014, so if you have any ideas of places to visit I’d love to hear from you!)

I really want to be one of those teachers that a student remembers. Because even though high school for me wasn’t the greatest time, I can’t deny that I had some brilliant teachers. And I think what set them apart was that they really loved what they taught. My Ancient History teacher now teaches in Egypt, something he had always wanted to do. My English teacher had a great passion for good poetry and good wine (I’ve only recently found out this after running into her at the bottle-o). My Biology teacher was just so enthusiastic about marine life and how life works he would sometimes stand on the table to try and express this. My math’s teacher had a great enthusiasm for boats, and was ecstatic when he taught us nautical terms and equations. And so these certain teachers, even if I don’t remember everything they taught, did teach me to find my passion and use it well. So not only do I want to teach kids Spanish, I also want to teach them to never stop searching for that thing you love. And if you find it, make it your career, your life work. So in a way, my passion is teaching others, and teaching them that they can do anything that they set their mind to. And so can you, Listserve reader. It’s never too late to find that thing you love.

I want to leave you with one of my favourite pieces of poetry. The author is no one famous, but it is beautiful all the same.

I tried to forget

But you grew roots around my ribcage

And sprouted flowers

Just below my collarbones.

All day I pluck at their petals

But I have not yet ascertained

Whether you love me

Or not.

Looking back at videos I have “favorited” or clips I have filmed from low resolution smartphones provides a montage of meaningful moments in my life: that song that that somehow encapsulate my college years, that music video that transports me back to San Francisco, even that video a hippo letting out a massive fart. :) Each of these videos has special meaning for me—whether they’ve influenced the way I think, remind me of a specific time in my life or just make me smile.

At that end, I’d like to share a couple videos that provide a window into my life in a way that 250 words never could.  If you’re interested in taking a look, head to YouTube and search for them exactly as they’re titled below. (My YouTube username is jnewman1986...lame I know). I hope you find meaning in these videos as well.

The Vatican Run: An epic adventureMy senior year of college I traveled to Italy with my closest friends. We awoke at the crack of dawn and we made our way to the Vatican. We sprinted through a maze of corridors (and the world’s finest art) in an effort to be the first tourists in the Sistine Chapel.

Sony Bravia (Bouncy Balls)I moved to San Francisco when I graduated from college. This video of balls bouncing down one of the city’s iconic hills was practically my only exposure to the city before I moved. Somehow the image of colorful balls cascading chaotically down a city street is an accurate metaphor for my time in SF.

Jordan's harrowing ride in HanoiA couple years ago I traveled to Vietnam with my family. We took a pedicab ride through the chaos that is Hanoi, which has no discernable traffic laws that I could make out. Despite the pandemonium, the city is bound together by a chaotic harmony that I grew to love.

I am in the middle of my second year of medical school, and these are some things that I believe in enough to share them with you:

1. Eat less, move more. People don't realize how detrimental being overweight is on every level—you’ll not only have a shorter life, but the the time you do have will be of terrible quality. So walk up the stairs. Going down the hall? Sprint there. Say no to that pizza. Eat more veggies.

3. Take a deeeeeeeeep breath and hold it. Now try to breathe in on top of that. That's what it's like for every breath for someone with emphysema. So if you smoke, think hard and decide whether it's worth having to breathe like that for a good chunk of your life.

4. VACCINATE. It’s frustrating to see websites/people making ludicrous claims that vaccinations cause autism or something crazy. Not vaccinating means unnecessary risk for yourself and entire populations. Many diseases aren’t seen in the US because of vaccination! Think about it this way--if you could say with 99.9% certainty that you could prevent your child from having a disease, what (good) parent on earth would decline that?

5. Give back! Google ""The Hunger Site"" and click daily to feed the hungry. It only takes a few seconds and you really make a difference. If all 21,800 people from the ListServe do this, we could donate 24,000 cups of food a day!

In general when shit sucks, just write about it and share it with the world. It makes things slightly better.

Here is something else I'm writing about in the hopes that it gets better:

The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world. MEANING: We put more of our citizens in jail and prison than anywhere else. There are 2.3 million people in the United States in prison or jail right now. 

That number is so high I can't fathom it. Instead I see the impact of this number everyday at work. As a forensic social worker, I see young kids, brains not fully developed, who have been abused, neglected, and rejected from their families, schools, social service agencies, and society. Some of them have made bad choices in life, but often there are not many good options.

I can tell you with absolute certainty that jail and prison, as they are currently envisioned, are not good ways to prevent future crimes. I haven't got the answer for what comes next, but I can tell you that the system we currently have is broken, obscene, and horrific. I kindly ask you to learn more about this issue and tell a friend.

New neighborhood, new school, new hormones, summer before freshman year in high school, like a (not so innocent) moth to a (bonfire) flame.  From the age of 13 to 22, I took him in like poison, drop by drop.  I still occasionally fight the thoughts and self doubt put in place over 8 years ago.  You couldn't tell me anything; I would defend him and make you sorry you ever questioned our relationship.  Through cheating, verbal abuse, physical altercations, humiliation, and manipulation, I let that poison take over my young mind.  Like a drop of ink in water, it spread inside me, it took over my thoughts.  What he said about my imperfections had to be true, right? What he wanted, I would fight to give him.  I loved him more than I loved myself and destructively gave him everything I had so he would feel the same about me.  I knew deep down it wasn't what love was supposed to be.

I had a loving home, with parents that still have me in awe of their love for one another. I had an example and I knew what a healthy relationship looked like.  I was going to change him, make him be the person I thought he could be!  In the 8th year, it was a spring day and we had been fighting.  I was on my way from college, at this point we lived together which made way for a whole new kind of control and manipulation.  I maneuvered my car down the winding back road, and as tears rolled down my face, I approached train tracks.  I so clearly remember thinking, feeling, so defeated.  “I DO NOT CARE, I GIVE UP, and I’M TIRED”, I graphically pictured the train coming, and me, in that defeat, not reacting, not caring what happened to me. Genuinely not caring.

I cry now, for the feeble girl I was.  It was in that moment, on that familiar road, I realized that I was lost.

That was the start of the end for us.  That time in my life made me the wife, the woman, the mother, the daughter, the dreamer I am today.  I hope to bring young girls in schools, and in my community to the mat for self-love.  For I found the hard way, in life, like in yoga, all the strength and love I need, is within me.

In every pose, a building, I am the foundation, with unique lines and beautiful architecture, imperfections and clutter.  On the mat...every breath, a renovation.. letting way to off the mat... a revelation! Clearing the clutter, cleaning up the negative.  Self- love, positive body image, confidence in our uniqueness and intelligence…..strength in the positive, that’s what I want to teach, teach teachers to teach, mothers, fathers, communities.  My gift to you:  You are strong, you are enough, in you, find love and never be lost.

December 2012,03,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/12/03/selfish-selflessness/,"December 2012, 03",Selfish Selflessness,"What if I told you that there's something called ""selfless selfishness""? (Try saying that three times really fast!) Throughout my college career, I always looked out for the best in others. I helped wherever I could, whether it was buying them lunch or going out of my way for a charity they were involved in. I never expected anything in return no matter what I did, and I thought there was nothing wrong with that.

A friend approached me one day and bluntly said, ""You're being selfish.""

Confused, I asked, ""How could helping others out be selfish?""

""Tell me Dat, How does it feel when you help others out?""

I reluctantly replied, ""Very good...""

""Then why not give others the chance to get the same feeling?""

Her words put things into perspective; I needed to let others have the opportunity to feel the same great feelings I felt when helping others. Giving and receiving is like breathing. Lungs function properly when air is inhaled (receiving) and exhaled (giving), and a successful person understands the proper balance of ""breathing.""

Today, I still continue to help others out. But I am aware of giving others the opportunity to contribute. I do this through a company that does motivational speaking, leadership development, and team building for individuals who are searching for success in their career and/or lives. I would love to stay in touch and offer my support and experiences. Follow me on Facebook/Twitter/Website by searching for Nolalight.

However, if you’d like some random social advice from a UNC-Chapel Hill senior, here ya go:

1)   Never be shy introducing yourself. Anytime you approach someone, whether at work or a bar, it’s a compliment to them.

     a.    People love to be approached for networking. Just by being interested you’re telling them that you see them as an expert in their field and you’d like to be where they are. I’ve never had anyone be less than thrilled when I asked them about their experiences.

     b.    Ex. I met the Partner and CCO at my advertising agency internship recently who everyone thought was intimidating. He’s actually extremely open, easy to get along with and full of advice.

Resulting from things that irk me:

2)   If a girl is in a bar, she wants to be approached. Doesn’t mean you’ll be the one to get her number or take her home, but don’t be afraid to introduce yourself.

     a.    Guys may have a fear of rejection, but we came out that night in our 5-inch heels to talk to someone.

     b.    Hint: it might be scary to approach a pack of girls, but we’re in the pack because we’re just as nervous to approach you. The pack is safe, but we’d rather break away.

                                     i.     It’s depressing when you catch a guy’s eye and he smiles, but then never gets the courage to come up to you.

3)   Know when to leave

     a.    I recently had a guy follow me around a bar even after separating twice. He was nice at first, but when a girl tells you she has to find her friends, she isn’t asking for help.

4)   Don’t become the “corner creeper.”

     a.    It’s surprising how many guys will literally stare a girl down like it’s a pickup line. I wonder if that works on someone…

5)   I’ll give you the best opening line that works on me: “Hi, I’m Tyler. *smiles*.”

A note to McLovett…

Stop hating winter. I know it’s freezing and dreary up there in Connecticut, and the days are shorter and darker, but it’s the best time of the year. There’s a calm about winter, when the air smells like burning wood and everything sparkles from the crystals on the trees. My favorite memories are from NY, sitting around a bon fire in snow with hot chocolate and family. Just enjoy the weather next to a fire with your favorite strawberry frosted mini wheats, and realize how much better summer is because you have to put up with winter. Don’t be a Negative Nancy. Winter is wonderful.

He is everywhere.

Lurking in the woodsmoke that fills the house in winter, there's a memory of the first time we built a fire together.

Cleverly tucked into the taste of cinnamon and cider, there's a memory of us walking underneath the changing leaves, steaming mugs of autumn in our hands.

Sometimes, it's not so simple.

Sometimes, it's a whiff of cologne in a crowd, and I am reminded of a shirt he used to own-- and the memory of that shirt unlocks whole passages of time spent together I hadn't thought of in years.  The images come flooding back; the porch we'd argue on, the bed we slept in, the trip we planned for months and never took.

You know the feeling: all it takes is one tiny thing, a domino, and a whole world of the past tumbles into focus. Triggered by a smell.  A touch.  A song.

Memory.

Stomach grumbling, I duck into a convenience store. I linger in the store, eyes closed shut from the cold. The cashiers are alert but their eyes are directed elsewhere, downward in trajectory.

I make it to my friend’s house, feeling the warmth of the lobby blast into my pores. I’m free at last from the frigid night air. Hopping onto the elevator, I see a stranger. We exchange polite smiles. She’s relaxed. The only thing I can think about is the beauty of the warmth.

White privilege. The idea of it initially stung me. Because I’m white I have some sort of advantage? I didn’t ask for this gain. Yet that’s no excuse to ignore the benefits of being a (Privileged) White Male:

I walk down streets alone without cops even glancing at me.

I enter stores and the cashiers aren’t suspicious of me.

I share confined spaces with others and they aren’t scared to interact with me.

At this moment in my life I am at the beginning of what I know will be a never ending journey to discover how my race, class, sex, and sexuality define my position in society. While many of you have been forced to contemplate these issues long before me for reasons I will never truly comprehend, I urge you to continue to do so. Invite white males in this conversation too, because without inclusive, intelligent discussion we will continue to wallow in a system of injustices.

Some of us will have to step down from the high platforms we have been on for far too long so that we can all stand together to see each other, and the horizon, on the same ground.

Below is a poem by Rudyard Kipling that I'd like to share with all of you, and I'd like to ask you to email me a poem or two back in response. I look forward to reading them.

If--By Rudyard Kipling

If you can keep your head when all about you    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,    But make allowance for their doubting too;If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster    And treat those two impostors just the same;If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,And lose, and start again at your beginnings    And never breathe a word about your loss;If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew    To serve your turn long after they are gone,And so hold on when there is nothing in you    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,    If all men count with you, but none too much;If you can fill the unforgiving minute    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

November 2012,26,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/11/26/the-growth-of-knowledge/,"November 2012, 26",The growth of knowledge,"Today we live like kings compared to our ancestors because they learned to control fire, to construct houses, to build air conditioners, and to administer penicillin. These are all solutions to problems that once existed. All problems have solutions, and solutions come in the form of new knowledge. These solutions always have problems of their own. When a solution has problems, it's tempting to want to regress to the ""good old days"", but this is a mistake, because those ""good old days"" were terrible. The solution is *more* knowledge.

Here's an example: On November 6 I voted against California's Prop 37, which required labeling of genetically-modified foods (GMO) in stores. There are various practical problems with both the proposition and with GMOs, but my main objection was that Prop 37 was, in spirit, a conservative regression away from progress. GMO solves problems, and has problems of its own. The solution isn't to ban or discourage or vilify GMO, but to increase knowledge in the form of *more* GMO. In 200 years people will ask of us, ""How did they survive when their food made them obese? When their food gave them diabetes and high cholesterol and cancer? Why were they okay with food coming from animals who suffered so much?"" GMO will bring unimaginable improvements (and new problems) to our descendants' lives.

Resist the urge to regress when a solution has problems. The only way out is through, with more knowledge. We all have a moral obligation to our descendants to be a force for the growth of knowledge, so that they may live like kings compared to us.

I'm a teenaged girl.  I'm not arrogant enough to think that I know much about the world.  I'm 18, a freshman in college, and I struggle every day trying to see into the future: into what might be, where I might go.  Recently I've decided that my destiny in life is to be a high-school biology teacher, but ask me again later and perhaps that will have changed. 

One thing I feel passionate about is body modification.  Somehow my standards of beauty have developed in a way that put piercings, tattoos, implants and scarification at the forefront.  However, my parents have threatened to cut off their funding for my education if I modify myself in any way.  I already have piercings, and though my family will never see them due to their private locations, I would love to be able to share this important part of my life with them and express myself through modification in a more public way.  Essentially, they have rejected my lifestyle, and through this, they have pushed me away.

What I'm trying to say is:  Don't let your standards of beauty bully someone else's into a corner.  Don't judge people based on their standards of beauty.  Shaming what someone finds beautiful, putting down what is truly important to them, can really undermine their happiness and their willingness to share any part of their life with you, so don't lose people because they think that full-body tattoos are wonderful and you find the idea nauseating or stupid.

Questions for you all: What advice would you give your 18-year-old self? Who is your favorite musical artist of all time? What do you love?  What advice would you give to a young girl who wants to find love? Reply to me, if you like (I made an address just to field these, so I better get a few).

Advice for you all: Look up ""futureme"" and write yourself a letter. You write an email and then choose when you want it delivered to yourself.  I receive emails from my past all the time, and it's alternately sweet and heartbreaking to get these tidbits from years past.

All the love,

We're told to exaustion that time is a fast and furious beast that eats your life away every second, and around this age it gets really evident. 

Finding a balance between dedication to my projects and actually getting a life without feeling like I'm wasting time is hard, and I am still struggling to find out where is the right point is.

I feel I had to throw away some things in life so I could grab new things to carry on. What I have learned is that there are three things you shoudn't throw away never ever, or you might lose forever:

- your health - your family - your friends

I finally realized that sleeping, eating well, doing exercises and go offline sometimes is essential.

I also found out that being kind to people around you is important too, or else *they* might feel like throwing *you* away.

I am Rike and I am a medical student in my fifth year.

My parents have always been involved in several fields, they are active in the green party, town parliament, youth organizations and within something like the red cross. This stuff sometimes stretched my nerves when I was a teenager. It was not that I didn´t support them but I didn´t know what´s the magic behind volunteering.

I began to study medicine and slowly but steady I became students representative, was engaged within our national association of medical students and organized several projects regional and national.

A few months ago I thought of decreasing the amount of projects I had besides my medical education due to my success as a future doctor and my personal private life. But two things changed me: First there was an article in a popular German magazine about the inner conflicts German doctors have treating their patients in a humane way and meeting the controllers demands concerning economic aspects by the same time. This article made me think deeply and I was glad having applied for the second thing I want to mention here, which was the HEALTHCARE LEADERSHIP SUMMERSCHOOL in the Netherlands. Organized by some great Dutch medical students it was one of the best experiences I ever made. There were 73 soul mates (few of them are on that list I guess!) and we motivated each other in facing the challenges of our healthcare system and to SPEAK UP for our wishes in our 32 home countries as well as to inspire others with doing so. Due to social media we are still connected very close!

I think you already know what these things did to me. I will somehow stay committed to several projects and associations. It gives me the chance to speak up, to create and to take part in proceedings around us!

Being some kind of volunteer allowed me to meet wonderful people, have inspiring friends and to make experiences I would surely not have made if I had just followed my schedule as a medical student. I will continue.

I am sorry that it became more than 250 Words and hope it is still okay!Warm regards,RikeGreifswald, Germany

PS: If you feel connected to health care, apply for the next edition of the Health Care Leadership Summerschool in 2013!"

And my stomach, and sides, and back- all of these things, the perfect size, holding those arms and legs together, connecting and shoring up, big because they have to be bulwarks against the iron that threatens to pull me down. 

Twenty nine years of hating this body and believing all of the liars that kept telling me to reject my body, wanting to pull me down just like the iron tries to pull me down. But now this big, tall, strong body of mine says no, and PULLS BACK. This body doesn't leave weight on the floor. This body doesn't shy away from building more muscle, packing it on like slabs of beef, engorging my limbs till they burst through shirts, split seams in dresses, make the earth tremble when I walk.

Most of you bought your PC with a pre-installed operating system. Of course you're used to working with it. It's OK, but often people don't know about variants, don't know that other operating systems for your PC exist, too! I'd like to tell you about my experience of working on Linux. About four years ago I started using Ubuntu 12.04 as the main operating system for my laptop, and, you know, it was one of the best of my decisions! I forgot about regular actions like the cleaning of system folders to make OS work faster, checking every external storage for viruses, etc. I didn't install any special drivers, didn't look for software on the internet. After a 30 minute installation my laptop was ready to work with all necessary software. Soon I got used it and lost all my habits and tricks of managing ""the most popular operating system for desktop computers.""

I am happy because my computers just work! Linux is free and stable -- you can also make a lot of changes inside it -- for example, set up another desktop environment, absolutely different, and it wouldn't be a hack, it's an ability of the system.

Try Ubuntu, 12.10 for example, the latest release. It's easy to install and easy to work with!

I want you to know that there are other operating systems, other platforms. Take the red pill and leave the Matrix :)

Many English patterns include the word ""is"" to relate one concept to another. This gives our brains a kind of paradox: the semantics of ""mary you are beautiful"" or ""i am happy"" gives our minds pleasurable meaning yet the symbol ""mary"" is-not the symbol ""beautiful"". I could more accurately say ""I find mary's appearance striking."" or ""I feel sensations of euphoria'. 

Every day for a few weeks now I read a section from a book on Animal Behavior by Aubrey Manning & Marian Stamp Dawkins. The current section talks about signal processing and how you can convince a frog that a piece of wire pipe ""is"" a snake by curling it in a certain direction. I wonder how much cognitive dissonance we produce in our nervous systems from false alarms by relating two symbols with ""is"".

Have you ever felt ""I am depressed""? Or ""I am the best""? Many humans spend their communication dramatizing their personal experiences into an all encompassing identity with another symbol.

Try decoding conversations you hear with sweeping ""is"" statements and see if you can translate them into more subjective speech. You might find yourself feeling surprise and pleasure as you rationally parse another's statement, instead of letting their full neurolinguistic programming sweep through your nervous system: ""the team is the best and no one can get in their way"" ""ugh, that is just the worst"".

You might find yourself tempted to distrust communicators who use extremes like this. If a friend says ""ugh, that is just the worst"" talking about getting rained on, for example, can you trust their advice when they tell you that ""choosing that path across the country is the worst""? 

But instead of out-right distrusting or memorizing which contexts have which meaning you can try bringing your cognitive dissonance into their mind and help them form a more accurate reflection of their world. Remember to ask them to do the same for you.

I believe you will find some use out of the above. English without the word ""is"" goes by the name ""e-prime"".

You might notice that hearts are tiny stars and only they can warm up flesh and bones and skin and eyes, and illuminate, what shadows menace, and where they fade, no life is possible. If you take another step and bend your knees, you might see that the moon is just a mirror and you will discover yourself when looking at it long enough. I dare you to question yourself and anything you take for granted. I'm not giving you advice or tell you the story of my life. I, today, dare you to become aware of your ignorance.

I am the founder and owner of the startup 42Kmi. My company develops products to enhance the competitive gaming experience, and we have a website dedicated to nurturing the community and incubating talents and hobbies in the areas of games, music, art, and design. I would like share a short story with you.

            The day was beautiful. The sky was clear with few clouds accenting the ever extending blue. The sun was warm like a loving embrace. A light breeze gaily danced around anything in its paths. And the mid-morning hour had an afternoon air about it. The day seemed like it could last forever.

            On this day, a mother took her two young sons to the market. She planned on buying lots of food and other things for the house, and she needed the help. The twin brothers, Gaius, the older brother, and Marcus, the younger brother, both loved visiting the market. The hustle and bustle of the market was always more active and exciting than their neat and orderly home environment. The structures and rules of their home hindered the brothers’ imagination, and Mother doesn’t usually ask the boys to accompany her to the market.

            “Gaius, Marcus, we need to buy some more fabrics as well!”

            “Okay!” the boys chimed, with their eyes barely peeking over the layers of bread and cloths stacked in their arms. Marcus and Gaius began to talk among themselves of fun and exciting thing they would soon see.

            “Livia! Livia!” a woman in the distance yelled. She was addressing the brothers’ mother. It was an old friend of Mother’s whom the boys had never met, but from seeing how their mother acts around her usual acquaintances, they knew how it would play out.

            “Boys, you two wait here. Your mother is going to talk to a friend.” Mother said. She then placed her basket of rolls on the dirt ground for the boys to watch before scurrying over to her friend.

            “Ahh! They’re gonna talk forever!” All day about this and that!” a frustrated Gaius exclaimed. Marcus dropped the linens he was carrying and took his seat on them.

            “Yeah,” Marcus added, “Gossip, gossip, gossip.”

            Some time passed as the brothers waited for their mother to return. Gaius stood with his head down, eyes closed, and his arms folded. Marcus scribbled in the dirt with a stick he found. The stick was about arms-length.

            “Ahh! They’re still talking! And there’s more of them!” screamed Gaius after looking over to see his mother. There were more of them. The women had flocked together like hens pecking the same kernel of corn, squawking and quieting as each took her turn talking to then listening to another. As the brothers waited, Gaius’s impatience grew. There was so much he and Marcus wanted to see. Marcus was still playing in the dirt, preoccupied with the stick.

            Then, a thought came to Gaius. “This could be fun.” he thought out loud.

            “Huh?” Marcus looked up from his dirt and saliva creations only to be welcomed by what seemed like a zephyr of dirt.

            “Gaius! What was that for?!” a flustered Marcus coughed, demanding an answer as he stood up. The once friendly dirt now violently burned in his eyes. Gaius ran to another area, giggling.

            “Come at me!” Gaius taunted, struggling to keep a straight face, “Come at me and put on a vicious face!” Marcus was angered. He knew it was Gaius who kicked the dirt in his face. He couldn’t figure why, but he knew he wanted to get him back.

            “Brother! You wear your most vicious face!” yelled Marcus, pointing his stick at his brother. Marcus could hear Gaius fighting laughter as he took flight. He ran, chasing Gaius around the market. Gaius enjoyed his run, catching only brief glimpses of some of the things he wanted to see. Marcus wanted Gaius. Nothing else. They rushed past a pottery stand, almost toppling its wares. The stand’s artisan railed at the boys, but his voice caught neither brothers’ ears. Gaius focused on outrunning Marcus. Marcus focused on catching Gaius. The brothers continued running, dodging other patrons, ducking behind stands, and diving under tables.

            “I think I lost him.” Gaius thought. Marcus was nowhere to be found. In his view, Gaius saw the most beautiful linens. “He won’t find me there.” He thought the sheets whispering with the wind provided the perfect cover. Without hesitation, he darted for the sheets faster than he could. He felt dizzy, as if he just finished a race and could take refuge in first place. But he could not stop until he reached his linen sanctuary. As he came closer, the wind picked up, then billowed. The sheets slightly rose from the ground, and Gaius could see somebody’s feet, with toes clenching the ground. He could not stop himself.

            “Oh no!” Gaius yelled, as if to warn the person of an unavoidable accident, but the legs didn’t move.

            “Got you!!” a familiar voice sounded. Before Gaius could recall the voice, a stick shot out and gashed his left cheek. Gaius’s eyes watched as the tip of the stick entered his cheek, and his eyes watched as the stick flung blood out and onto the brilliant sheets as it exited the wound. It was Marcus.

            With his thoughts collected, Gaius stopped. He examined the wound with his right hand. His blood felt cool, then hot, and the wound was deep. With his tongue, Gaius could feel the wound inside his mouth. The skin was thinner in that area. His tongue could feel his fingers. This angered him, and with the blood still fresh on his fingertips, Gaius charged and took his fist to his brother’s vicious face. He made contact. Now stained with Gaius’s blood, Marcus rose with the blood flicked linen. His grip on the stick loosened, and Gaius felt the impact as his knuckles popped and cracked against his brother’s flesh. He could feel his nails enter the palm of his tightly clenched fist.

            Marcus landed and a cloud of dirt rose then fell. Dirt fell on the blood his brother left on his face. Marcus whimpered. Tears welled. His vicious expression was gone. Gaius, enveloped in rage, walked the distance his brother’s limp body traveled before settling. He squat down examining Marcus and nursing his own wound.

            “Brother,” Gaius began, “Be willing to strike vigorously. Vigorously to overcome!” Gaius picked himself up and saw Marcus’s stick. The tip inked in his blood was now caked with dirt. Gaius picked up the stick, the weapon forged against him. He examined it, his cheek, and his brother. He turned from Marcus and walked away with the stick in hand. Marcus lied where he lay in the linen sanctuary, surrounded by the blood speckled sheets. “Brother, you win, yet you failed,” he snickered aloud to himself.

            Walking away, Gaius falls to his knees. He soon begins to cry. He now realizes the depth of what has just transpired. He can’t help his tears. What he thought began as play quickly became real, and blood, his own blood, was drawn. This feeling was too much to bear. It choked him.

            “Curses!” Gaius yelled to the sky, pounding his fists to the ground, “Curses to this day! Curses to what it brought!” His tears continue to flow before he picks himself up. He continues walking, but the day’s events keep replaying in his mind. His walk becomes staggered and stuttered. Gaius slows his pace, and stops walking. He closes his eyes and hurls the arms-length stick forward as hard as he could. The stick spirals, traveling for a moment before a crash is heard. The sound of shattered pottery. Gaius looks to the sky again, “Curses to this too!” He runs in the direction of the shattered sound.

            Among the pottery shards, Gaius finds the stick. It’s still about arms length, but its tip is broken, and along with it Gaius discovered three strangely shaped, beautifully colored rocks; a cardioid shape, a star shape, and a stone oddly resembling a tomato.

            “What are these three?” Gaius asked himself. He reached for the rocks, wanting the day to be over.

            “They are mine, Gaius!” It was Marcus. He wanted what his brother held. He charged at his brother. Gaius could see the hate in his eyes.

            “Marcus, forgi-,” before Gaius could finish, Marcus pounced on him. They rolled and rumbled in the dirt. Gaius could feel the dirt filling his wound. Marcus wanted to hurt Gaius. Gaius didn’t want to get hurt, and he didn’t want to hurt Marcus again. The brothers tumbled into many stands and bumped into many people. The struggle was great. People watched as two boys fight and fought. No one cared to stop them. Soon the brothers tumbled into a large group of women. A woman in the crowd quickly looked as these vicious boys brushed against her leg.

            “Whose children are these?!” The boys froze in position. Gaius laid on the ground, holding the stick, fending off Marcus, who held the stones in his left and a raised fist in his right. The shrill voice of the nasal woman snapped the boys, dirtied from a day of brawling, back to their senses.

            “Gaius! Marcus!” Mother emerged from the crowd. “Why are you boys fighting?” They couldn’t answer. They had no answer. The bothers managed to point at each other in an attempt to escape blame. Mother saw what each brother was holding and saw that her sons were dirty.

            “Your playing has gotten out of hand. You two are brothers. You should behave and share like brothers.” Mother apologized to the other women and took her guilt stricken sons to collect the items they left behind and they went to finish their shopping.

Against all odds I was chosen to write to The Listserve, but my 48 hour period expired. Although I usually read all Listserve emails on the day I get them, this one I didn't open on time to respond to it (48h).

This may be a lesson worth to be shared. It's a metaphor of what life is all about: taking the chances, grabbing the opportunities. Because they will arise and if we are not ready to take them it may almost be like they never even existed to us.

But in my life I have learnt that there is always a second chance. If this message is reaching you it is the proof that it is true.

So, if you are reading this...

1) Be ready to take the opportunities in your life.2) If you think you just missed one, try to pursue it anyways, cause it may not be completely lost.3) Learn from your mistakes so you don't miss another one, and be ready for the next.

Intrepid author, archer, singer, fencer, guitarist, language lover (any German or Spanish speakers here?), blogger, and bunny enthusiast.If you could tell the whole world something, what would you say? I want to give a tiny little piece of advice: be a little crazy. Be a misfit. Be bubbly and exuberant and just be yourself. Cherish everything. Keep track of every detail. Jump into someone’s arms and let them spin you until your head is spinning (or, be the catcher and spinner of the person running at you). Compliment someone, dye your hair a crazy color, write some poetry. Take a chance, because damn it, you don’t know if you don’t try. Find inspiration from those around you, not celebrities. Make your own way in the world. And most importantly? Whoever and wherever you are, there is always an opportunity for your voice to be heard. Know that you’re a good person. You’re AMAZING, more so than you could ever believe – even if you never hear people say it. Be confident in yourself. You can change the world, people. Believe me, I’ve done it in my own ways and seen the results. My roommate Mariah insisted that I include the quote, “everything will be alright in the end. If it’s not alright, it’s not the end.” She said that would make you smile. I certainly hope it did, because the world is a better place even but for a single smirk (also, there are a bunch of positive side effects – but I’m not here to go all psych major on you).

Much love,Emilia =)Also, not to be that annoying girl who promotes her own stuff, but please check out my blog at blogs.fit.edu. It helps me to pay for college, yo!"
November 2012,14,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/11/14/try-a-tri/,"November 2012, 14",Try a Tri,"When most people think about triathlons, one of the first thing they think of, are those extraordinary images of ironman athletes fainting at the finish line after swimming, biking and running continuously for over 12 hours. Regular folks immediately rule it out as a sport reserved for a rare breed of elite athletes and never look back, not knowing that there is a lot more to triathlon than this.

Had you told me 2 years ago that I would be doing triathlons in 2012 I would have called you out on your shenanigans. Back in 2010 I was a hefty 190 lbs couch potato. In the summer of 2011 I got myself a bicycle, read about multisport and picked up running and swimming. By the New Year I was down to 150 lbs and felt more physically and mentally stronger than ever before. For my first season, I completed 2 triathlons and ran a half-marathon.

If you are looking for a new challenge, trying out a tri might just be for you. You will get fitter, feel better and meet awesome people all at the same time. To start off in this adventure, you will only need some kind of swim wear, a pair of running shoes and a bike. You don’t need the latest generation tri bike, any bike will do. Many people race on hybrids or mountain bikes. I have even witnessed a gentlemen competing on one of Montreal’s bikeshare program bike at a tri I raced this year.

Let’s talk about distance. For someone like me, who had no fitness base, I would highly recommend searching your area for a Sprint distance event. The swim is 700m, the bike is 20km and the run is a 5k. You can find a lot of free training plans on the internet for this distance but generally training 4 to 5 hours a week for a few months will get you through the finish line of your first Sprint triathlon.

Next up is the Olympic tri. At double the Sprint distance (1.5k swim, 40km bike and 10k run) this is starting to become a serious distance. As the name implies, this is the distance that is covered at the summer Olympics. While some novice will choose this distance for their first events, a careful preparation will be required to successfully complete the event. Hiring a coach might also be beneficial if your budget allows it.

After that we enter the world of long distance events. The half-ironman (1.9k swim, 90k bike and 21.1k run) and full ironman (3.9k swim, 180k bike, 42.2k run) is truly the holy grail of most long distance triathletes. While some will choose these distances as their first events, it is not recommended. The training regimen for such distance is very strict. Get a feel for your body on shorter events first, like a sprint or Olympic and once you feel that you have mastered those distances you will be ready to move up the ladder.

Running you first race is an incredible experience and should you choose to try a tri, you will always remember that day as an unforgettable experience. You’ll also get the bragging rights to say you completed a triathlon, something that you might have not envisioned possible just a few months ago.

I hope I was able to give you a little bit of the taste for racing a triathlon and should we cross paths at an event in the future, don’t be a stranger, come and say hello!

I got this ""you won the listserve lottery"" email on my birthday!   OK, since I've got a big audience: I teach high school in a detention facility for teen-aged repeat offenders.  One of the many things that we try to do for the kids is to give them some exposure to the different kinds of opportunities they might have as adults if they manage to hang in there and finish their education.  Most of the students in our classrooms have had little exposure to the wider world beyond grinding poverty and limited adult support.  That's where you come in (I hope).

I am using this platform to ask you to do something for my students.  And maybe for students everywhere, who knows?  I'd like you to make a video, maybe 3-5 minutes, about what you do for a living.  If you can try to answer the following questions, that would be awesome: 1. What kind of work do you do (day to day duties and overall) 2. How did you come to do your job? 3. What kind of education or training does your job require? 4. What kind of salary, benefits, life enhancing joy does your job offer (either now or a range of projected earnings for a career) 5. How could a young person learn more about the kind of work you do?

Please feel free to interview your co-workers, show (legal!) video of what you do and projects you're working on or have completed.  Please do not feel like your job is not interesting enough.  My goal is to show a broad range of career opportunities to my students.  I will preview all the videos before sharing them, although I'm sure that none of you would send along something inappropriate.

Please upload the video to YouTube and then email me the link to  with any commentary that you feel might help or support your video.

Please do *not*: Tell us your last name or contact information in the video, although I would be glad to have that in the email that you send. Use gratuitous language or depict any violent or inappropriate images. Worry about the quality of your video - the students will be able to get something from it!

I have no idea how this will turn out.  I'm really excited to find out.

I'd like to thank you in advance for doing something to help out a bunch of kids who were born between a rock and a hard place.

Ok.. first of all, I don't want to come off as a freak that keeps a dog in my fanny pack & has to show you pics till your eyes bleed. I simply want to share an experience that I had with a particular dog that will have forever changed my life. & no offense if you do keep your dog in our purse/man purse, just as long as the dog is healthy & happy no beef with me. But I do find I get along with most animals better than most people, me thinks,...  I need to Bark at the Moon.

 I come from a large ranch in So. Texas. We had so many dogs, all sorts of breeds, some of the Shepherds we had will always live in my heart, somewhere. However It has been just over a month since my Wife & I put down my most impressive companion of 13 years, my Greatest of Danes, Akasha. So few dogs truly have near genius intellect. As a fresh pup I only had to show her, her the accidents twice, before she was at the door! Then I noticed at a very young age of some 50 days that she'd look in the direction of what I was focusing my eyes on when giving her commands. Soon she wouldn't let me leave the house without a defiant F*** You bark. As far as she was concerned, if i was suiting to go to mars, she expected there to be a perfectly Great Dane shaped space suit. I'm not saying even the average dog isn't incredibly resourceful & smart. But once & again a dog comes into your life & you come to realize that, the Noble creature is so much a companion & truly needs to attend to your needs. The very definition of man's best friend. She was nothing short of the finest of Canine Ambassadors to the Human Race. (& gave the finest and most plentiful of HUGS)  It was my honor to make the last year of her life, unforgettable on her good days & cared for her every need on the bad. She never slept on the ground in her life, even when we backpacked, & because of this she had never had a callous, anywhere. I took the best care of her, as she took amazing care of me as well as several of the people so close to me, like a Mother. I know that Akasha would want me to set her ashes on the mantle & find myself a new best friend. Creatures comprised of such intense love & kindness can never die, she was in her life an old soul. I can only be most thankful that we were able to lay her to rest in the best possible manner here at our home. In foresight 13 years on a Great Dane is 91 in human years. Now I see it getting cold & I am a bit thankful she isn't suffering through it, it would've been one hard winter for her. So I can only hope that we allowed her to pass with dignity & love.  I truly won the lotto when I picked her as a pup, & I hope I win the doggie lotto again :P. Truthfully, I could have an enormous amount of money & it would not make me happy, Akasha was priceless. I will forever have the hardest time referring to her as a Dog.

 To all animal owners! Read about the food you feed your pets, Knowledge is power! If you take Vitamins, Glucosamine, Chondroitin, Fish Oil, youself. Chances are some of your animals can benefit greatly from these as well. I've had the great fortune in my life to have had some amazing animals & never underestimate how affectionate any of them can be especially Birds, or even some Reptiles, I had an Iguana that opened my eyes completely he loved attention. & would even wake me up in the morning 6am sharp for breakfast, kinda blew my mind cause he'd follow me in the kitchen climb up my undies to get at the greens as I was chopping em. Ever had an Iguana wake you up looking out the side of his head like a bird right on top of your face & he's some 7 feet long?  Yea, Louie was a great Iguana believe it they can absolutely be housebroken & its so much better for them.

-just today  PBS Nature Vid Great Dane & Deer best friends on youtube. Check it out its a teak jerker. The Dane is a splitting Image of mid aged Akasha- respond if you'd like a picture to see yourself. Well.. I'll stop rambling & yet you ladies & gentlemen get on with you days. its been a pleasure.

Please to all those who have lost noble creatures that have changed you, my heart goes out to you. I don't know if there is an afterlife, but if there is, & there are no dogs there, I want no part of it!

My name is Sloan and I am senior at Gonzaga University in Washington State. I enjoy reading all of your insights and reflection every morning when I wake up. I can relate and learn from each and every one of you.

Here is my story … in the course of 8 weeks last spring everything that I used to call familiar changed. My foundation of my family shattered when we learned my dad was having an affair and wanted a divorce from my mom. My heart broke further when I lost my hero and best friend in life, my grandfather. Everything that used to comfort me was now hurting me. Sometime I questioned if I was strong enough to get through what was the darkest time of my life. But I read a book:

“A Grace Disguised: How the Soul Grows Through Loss” by Gerald Sittser. This book talks about his struggle with suffering after losing three generations of his family in the course of one night due to a car accident. In his book, he offers up some insights to dealing with suffering: he says, when dealing with suffering you have choices… you can run from your problems and the darkness, but that darkness will continue to chase after you trying to engulf you. Sittser questions, what would happen if you turned around and ran straight into the darkness and faced your darkness, however hard it is, until you reach the light at the end of the darkness?

That is what I decided to do. I faced my problems and ran straight into the darkness. It was not easy and it is still not easy. I do not know if I am completely out of my darkness but I know one thing: I am stronger than I ever thought I was.

I encourage each of you to face your darkness and run to the light. It is not easy and it will be hard most days but I will tell you that you will become stronger, more self-reliant, and understand yourself better than you ever imagined.

Here is my last thought, it is my favorite quote from another amazing book: ""When you're deprived of all freedom...you still have the most important freedom of all, which no one can take away from you: that is the freedom to choose what kind of person you want to be."" ― Ingrid Betancourt, “Even Silence Has an End: My Six Years of Captivity in the Colombian Jungle.

November 2012,10,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/11/10/oh-god-im-so-old/,"November 2012, 10","“Oh god, I’m so old.”","I turned twenty-three last Friday and I now find myself at a bizarre crossroads in my life. I just hit the one-year mark of my first real career job. I’m in the industry that I went to school for. I’m sitting behind a desk inside an iconic building in Toronto where I schedule television shows for the largest Canadian television network. I have a salary, I have a benefit package, and I’m doing well enough financially to support myself for the next few years.

Getting back to that bizarre crossroads now – I feel like I’m older than I actually am. I can’t go on Facebook now without seeing people I know getting pregnant or getting engaged or also getting career jobs. It doesn’t help though that this is counter-balanced by all the people on my Facebook that are still getting hammered every weekend and doing nothing with their lives. Who do you want to be, Bon?

“Whoo! Dranks with mah gurlz!”“Cancun 2012!”

You know what I mean.

Getting down to the nitty-gritty, I’m making a bold assumption that this is all stemming from the fact that I’m single and actively want to be in a relationship. No more of this going out and getting laid business. I think I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve made the joke, “We get it! You’re happy!” whenever a couple walks by – unfortunately there’s a half-truth buried in there somewhere. Truth be told, I haven’t had a steady girlfriend in a few years. Keyword: Steady. I’ve had a few “girlfriends” the few years that have always been on-off-on-off but never one steady enough to actually say, “Yo, I’m dating this girl.”

My problem is that I watch too many romantic comedies that star Ryan Gosling. Why can’t I be Ryan Gosling? Give me the rain moment – I totally earned it. I’ll totally renovate a house for you. Or I can pull that stunt from Love Actually where Andrew Lincoln shows up at Keira Knightley’s door with cue cards. You know what I’m talking about, don’t even lie. Now I just have to channel my inner Shane West in A Walk to Remember and name a star after my next girlfriend.

Wow, did I just write that last paragraph? Moving along.

This has played out like an overly long dating service video. It really isn’t. I’m not lying around going, “WHY CAN’T I FIND A GIRLFRIEND!?” It takes second-fiddle to whatever is going on in my life at the moment that is infinitely more important.

I’ve literally written this as a stream of conscious and know what I realized? I’m twenty-three year old. I’m not old at all. My life is so fun and I honestly couldn’t care less that I’m still single. I have a concert to go to tonight. I have two birthday parties next weekend. I have another two concerts the following weekend. And then it’s the holidays.

Did I say something about a crossroads earlier? Forget that. If anyone in the Toronto area wants to dance their heart out or have an evening of shuffling through my overly large collection of romantic comedies, let me know.

I had to end it as if it was a dating service video, it was just too easy.

Equipped with our wits, a map, and a snack, We’re searching for fun, we’re on the right track!- Introduction, The Essential Calvin and Hobbes

Calvin & Hobbes epitomizes the childhood I had wanted but as a kid, did not possess the guts to live. As an adult (or someone pretending to be), I'm trying not to live a life of regret by going by the words of yet another person with an impressive imagination -- Tolkien, who said ""All those who wander are not lost"".

New Yorkers pride themselves in knowing exactly where they're going. And for the most part, I do too. But getting lost sometimes just means we don't know what we're supposed to be looking for. And that's totally okay.

Getting lost is not a waste of time. Sure it can be frustrating when you least intend to be. But when the clock isn't ticking, I've often found myself discovering beautiful vistas, incredible stories, quirky alleys, and accidentally poignant photographs.

So go on - Wander. Explore. Get Lost. And don't be afraid to like it.

I’m a Brazilian 21 yr old but my great-grandparents were from Japan - that can impress even those who know me well, given the lack of slanted eyes or a peculiar surname.

I think you should listen to Peter Bjorn & John songs that are NOT ""Young Folks"".

I’ve been working with account planning in an advertising agency for almost 2 years now, and my main freetime hobby lately has been bread-baking. This weekend I plan on baking my first bread made with a natural starter (or levain) I've been working on for the past weeks.

You should also google Inhotim and find out what it is all about.

I’m really into traveling, little into spending lots with it, quite into meeting new people.

So I think you should drop me a line if ever coming to Brazil, and I’d be very glad if anyone could offer me a couch spot in..say.. Tokyo or Portland anytime ;) (or whichever incredible places you all live at).

To me, that’s the thing about Listserve:

Actually connecting interesting people instead of accumulating versions of “life-is-short-do-what-you-love"" messages that stream from sender to recipients and rarely the other way around. (no offence ;-))

I was quite pleased to read and reply to someone who cooks dinners from all over the world, and amused by the fact that Oxford Comma is not only a song by Vampire Weekend, for example.

It was so cold that the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing under the pile of cow dung and promptly dug him out and ate him.

Moral of the story:

(1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. (2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. (3) If you are happy and warm in a pile of shit then it's smart to keep your mouth shut!

.........and the doctor recommends (I really am one) :-

1) Make an effort to smile everyday, it will help you live longer.2) Don't forget how to use a pen. 2) Enjoy your single malt scotch as it was intended...straight and unadulterated. 3) Take time to sit with your eyes closed for atleast 10 minutes...it will open up your mind. 4) Read IF by Rudyard Kipling and Auguries of Innocence by Wiliam Blake.5) Everything will be alright at the end, if it's not alright then it's not the end

Live long and prosper my friends!

It was construction season in Boston.

-------------

Two mathematicians, Joe and Bob, are in a restaurant.  Joe is talking about how he feels that math education has really improved in his lifetime.

Bob is a grumpy old man.  He disagrees.  Strongly.

Joe says, ""You know, I bet the average person on the street even knows a little calculus.""  Bob laughs.

Bob goes to the bathroom.  While he's gone, Joe calls their waitress over and tells her: ""Listen, I'm going to ask you to come over here in about five minutes.  When you do, I'll ask you a question.  I want you to answer ""One-third x cubed."" If you do, I'll leave an extra $5 in the tip.""

The waitress blinks at him.  ""One thir-dex cue?""

""Sure, close enough.""

Bob comes back from the bathroom and Joe says, ""Look, I'll bet our waitress knows the integral of x squared.""

Bob scoffs.  Joe bets him $10.

They call the waitress over and Joe asks her the integral of x squared.  As instructed, she answers ""One third x cubed"".

And as she's walking away, she calls back over her shoulder, ""plus a constant.""

It wasn't until about a year ago that I started to begin the process of realizing that this penance I was serving was not only unnecessary, but was destructive and self-perpetuating, was in fact the evils of the world coming to rest for a moment in my heart. I am starting to learn to take deep breaths and to override my own maladaptive mechanisms and to trust my instincts and to be free from this self-imposed tyranny and also of course to realize how much more frightening that is. I cry a lot but I think that's good and I'm extremely happy and lucky to have people in my life who can set my mind at ease.

2. We have total 17,508 islands and more than 500 different local languages

3. The most famous holiday spot is Bali, i believe. Pretty island beaches, rich culture, great people. Get called island of gods sometime.

4. Your Sumatra and Java coffee come from here. Of islands with same name

5. We have the tastiest instant noodle ever: Indomie. Maybe you can find one in ur local chinatown. They sell it in Amazon as well :D 

6. Second largest home of Facebook user, and 6th largest for Twitter. Well since we're like the 4th most populated country in the world filled with happy chatty people. Haha.

When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance. We need to learn to love ourselves first, in all our glory and our imperfections. If we cannot love ourselves, we cannot fully open to our ability to love others or our potential to create. Evolution and all hopes for a better world rest in the fearlessness and open-hearted vision of people who embrace life."" - John Lennon

Lately I’ve been digging into some deeply rooted fears and thought patterns that were established long before I can remember. It’s been a terrifying, humbling, hilarious and enlightening process. I’d like to encourage you to notice your fears when they arise and spend some time thinking about what fears and fear mean to you.

Do your fears inspire you, challenge you or leave you feeling stuck?

Is fear something to be conquered, managed, ignored or befriended?

How does fear impact your relationships, goals and health?

Students will follow my journey via a blog and a discussion board.  And they're also going to design experiments for me to do while I'm down there. I'll also have a live chat with them sometime during my trip.

And, one of the coolest parts, is that anyone can join in - not just my students.  Other classes will be following me but so will business people, pilots, cops, pre-schoolers, grandparents, etc.  It's exciting to share my experiences with everyone because I get to show people that it really is possible to do almost anything you want.

Dancing.

Six years ago, swing dancing changed my life. Now I dance tango, waltz, swing, and blues. I wanted to share dance lessons -- not the footwork, but the developmental ways in which partner dancing has helped me personally:

* Resolve   Few people actually have ""two left feet"". The first times you go dancing, it's awkward. Doubly true for guys, having to lead. Stick to it, and within about two months, that feeling passes. Practice, learn, get better.

* Leadership   Guys have to be confident and lead the dance, think ahead, and watch where it's going. But the best ladies will, given opportunities, lead stylistically. Sometimes slow, sometimes energetic; it depends on the song.

* Listening   Listening to the music is easy; you can practice by concentrating on one instrument in a song. Dances can be styled on those cues. Listening to your partner is the most difficult. It's called...

* Connection   At a base level, it's physical touch, but involves respect, intuiting your partner's actions (crucial in Tango!) and, wordlessly, dancing together to the music. It's very personal. There are great dancers I can't connect with; conversely, there are newbie dancers that I can. Somewhere in 'connection' is a metaphor for interpersonal relationships of all kinds.

Feel free to write if you'd like to hear more (I can expound for pages).  Or if you're in the Bay Area, to come out dancing!

I have kept so many things unsaid thinking that people can read my mind and have ended up disappointed in the outcome but really I should have just said what I felt or taken the next appropriate step before the disappointment came to sneak up on me. I have the “just do it” mindset now with everything in my life - whether it’s going up to someone new, asking for a promotion, or just being bold and trying to get what I want in life. A lot of situations shock me when it turns out in a positive way but of course there are things that don't turn out how I want them to but that just leads me to believe it is not meant to be. I truly believe that everything happens for a reason and leads me to the next place that IS meant for me.

Embrace your path, take the chance/risk (so long as it is in a positive way) and live your life how you want. Things left unsaid will always be unsaid; things left undone will always be waiting to be finished....

The difference between a fear and a phobia, fear is something you talk yourself into, a phobia is when people rationalise it by giving your fear a clinical name ( My justification Jk is that this is my opinion:P ), but fear/phobia will always stop you from doing the things that are fun and Interesting.

I'm generally a scared person, I have a huge fear of ducks (Not a good story, needless to say being billed by a duck is very expensive lol), spiders, heights, disappointing people and not being good enough to be a performer. But I have been lucky enough to be surrounded by, and to share my life, with people who push me to confront my fears, they drag me through flocks of ducks, take me to tall buildings and encourage me to follow my dreams.  Hence I am now starring as Audrey in ,and producing, a production of Little Shop of horrors.

Moral.... surround yourself with people who push and challenge you and force you to think, feel and do things differently, things that scare the pants off you, Otherwise you will always be that 16 year old girl screaming, crying, surrounded by a huge flock of ducks while people laugh at you, or, you just won't have the courage to follow your dreams!!

I have realized the low rent I pay is directly related to the fact that I overlook an intersection on the preferred street of emergency vehicles, which means they lay heavily on the horn, at all hours of the night, to cross through red lights. It does not bother me in the least. The sirens remind me that we are all emergencies, at one time or another. I’m also reminded to turn off the oven.

I recently began my first full-time job working for the state. I am a man who thinks deeply and laboriously about where I am in life, where I could be, and how best to do the right thing at all times. I am surprised to find myself a civil servant, but I believe a government is only as good as the people who run it. I feel I am a good person, so I accept trading my spoken word poet’s cap for an oxford button down and a name badge. I leave work daily feeling fulfilled.

Lastly, I know for certain only a few things.-My wife and I keep each other warm.-There is inherent power in a smile.-Also, in being silent, sometimes.-Being wronged gives you a unique advantage over the one who wronged you: the ability to forgive him.-I am afraid of forgetting.

Fail.. 

Fail big and fail harder Unafraid and Unashamed Do a thing you want to do and fail at it

Once you have failed, notice how things basically stay the same.. Your friends will still be your friends, the sky will still be blue, mornings will still mean getting out of bed

After your failure only ask yourself only two things: > What can I learn from this failure? > Would I like to try again? Any answers you honestly come up  with are good answers, follow them and if applicable; fail again

If by any chance you should fail to fail and succeed at the thing you want to do Thats ok too :-)

Baden-Powell himself recommended alternating every fifty paces, but I prefer twenties as it's easier to count. My perennial optimism about how long it takes to walk somewhere makes me do it, and I enjoy breaking records for regular trips. I like the control that comes from having a number of ""gears"" at my disposal--easy strolling, brisk marching, an unpressured trot, the truth of a life lived under my own steam, and feeling... fit and well.

Scout's pace is obviously only the English term: do it a bit harder and you're speaking Norwegian: a fartlek. As for what the technique's most legendary exponents--the nomads of the Kalahari--call it, I have !kno idea! It is only the blink of an evolutionary eye since we were all hunter-gatherers; and yet we have forgotten Scout's pace, with dreadful consequences. Many ills of the Western lifestyle--obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, stress and depression--can be traced to our lack of exercise.

I, too lazy and too ambitious to walk all my life, have transferred this knowledge to the bicycle. I could have discussed the virtues of a 24:32 minimum development, or the necessity of mudguards, or the late 19th century campaign by cyclists for paved roads, that led, in time, to the lamentable car culture, but I wanted to stick to the basics.

We want to to eat, enjoy sensual pleasure, make money, gain recognition. None of these are bad per se, but often these desires are misdirected towards not-so-great ends. We as a race have sought to control these desires from the very beginning. It's perhaps what Plato referred to as Justice, Aristotle as eudaimonia, Hindu's as moksha, Muslims as Sufism, or spiritual elevation by many.

At the core of all of these philosophies is the idea that Mankind is Free. Not freedom in a democratic sense, freedom in a spiritual sense. Man is free to control and direct the desires of the heart.

If you start the process of restructuring yourself to be truly free, you may be plagued with painful Socratic questions. Are you in startup land to 'make it big' or are you there to have others see you make it big?

Treasure your friends. Nearly 30 weeks ago, I was forced to cut ties with some of my best friends. The friends that I really knew, they were gone to me, and the friends that I could still go on with, expected me with my other group. So it is this I say, treasure them. Treat every day with them as it could be the last. I didn't know that lesson before this, and it still haunts me.

Being ""content"" is increasingly my definition. I am entirely content in my life as it is in this chapter, I imagine this is what most people are looking for and hope they find it. This doesn't mean life is perfect, winning the lottery would be helpful, but I accept and love where I am.

I realized my luck during a regular walk through Central Park in NYC. There were so many memories there, where I fell in love with my husband, where we eloped before our crazy East meets West wedding in New Zealand, where I've enjoyed many a Saturday with a picnic and people watching. I came to this city at 18 and feel like I was raised by her and her people. I am grateful for the mistakes I was allowed to make in the general anonymity and the celebrations shared with complete strangers (go yanks!)

Of all of the lessons New York has taught me, I am grateful the walk in the park reminded me how lucky I am to live in this city, in relative good health and comfort, with a heart full of love and optimism. I am content. I am happy. 

What is your definition of life's happiness?

I dance a lot, even though I’m terrible at it. But that’s ok, because I’d rather be bad at doing something I enjoy, than be good at doing something I hate.

I believe life is too short to spend doing things - or being with people - you don’t really like. So just focus your energy on the people and things that you love.

It’s important to work for a living, but not live for working. With the exception of the lucky few who have found a way to make money doing something they truly love and enjoy, most of us work fulltime jobs just to make ends meet, and there’s nothing wrong in admitting that. So come in to work on time and leave on time, and enjoy real life.

Contrary to what a lot of people say, money is not evil. Money is great. It gives you the freedom to do as much or as little as you want, for yourself and for others. It gives you the power to help other people. It gives you the luxury of exploring your own self. So don’t be embarrassed to admit that you love money. I sure do!

“Stay hungry, stay foolish” are four words have been quoted ad nauseam, but I believe that better advice has never been dispensed in fewer words.

I also believe that is no such thing as “The One”. The power for someone to be The One resides not in them, but in you. It can be whoever you want it to be, or it can be no one.

But once you find someone you love and who loves you back, hold on to them. Fight like mad dogs if you have to, but also kiss and make up. Because no matter how bad things get, if you have a shoulder to rest your head on and a hand to wipe your tears, you will get through it.

Love and light,

I am second year medical student. This is not my first time being in second year. Yes, I failed my examinations. And I chose to redo the year rather than re-sits. Why? Maybe I was/am crazy. It was just a lot culminating at me losing my footing. I forgot to stand up and fight back. I forgot to do what I had to. Anyway, I know better now. I don't see it as a failure anymore. It is just everything never to do again for me. My parents don't know I am repeating my year of study. In fact, most of my family and friends don't. Instead, I chose to tell you guys. 20000+ strangers, few I know and have met, but mostly strangers. 

I like to write in my spare time. Very very few people know this about me. I also love teaching. Here is something I wrote the other day.

Parallels or crossing paths? Which one do you pick? On parallels you are equidistant yet unable to meet. Ever. Temptations teasing so close by. Fights and flailing at a distance. With cross paths you just meet once to maybe an explosion of souls. Then you move on to the unknown to never cross again. So which one do you choose? I say take neither. Pick a line and stay on it. Sometimes behind, sometimes ahead. Other times above if not below. Yet on the same path. Always. 

Sending you much love, Amir

I learned many things about myself during my graduate education; in particular, I learned that I truly don't want to continue in biology. Suffice to say, killing my research animals made quite an impression.

Throughout my studies, I had a growing interest in pointing my biomechanics knowledge less toward animal systems and more toward robotics. My interests grew until finally I broke biology ranks and took an introductory robotics course through the computer science department at my university the semester before I graduated. I didn't have the background everyone else in the room did, and I spent a lot of time outside of class catching myself up on unfamiliar material. I loved every second of it. 

My new goal is to develop this interest to the point that I can pursue a graduate degree in robotics and make contributions in that field. Since I'm now out of school, a lot of this development is must be done informally. I'm documenting the process on my blog, robotfrogblog.blogspot.com. I'm hoping to use this record as a way to keep myself motivated, to follow my progress, and especially once I have something concrete in my new graduate school search, to set an example for anyone else out there who finds themselves wanting to re-chart their course. As I've been told, it's never too late to start over... or to change.

This is limiting. This is what I say to myself. It doesn't make my life easier or happier. Then why do I say them? I go running anyways. It's much more easier if I enjoy it...or at least tell myself (out loud) why it's good for me and why I like it. I like running because I'm in control not my body. Going for a run is good for my self-discipline, it also helps me to get out of my comfort zone. It's amazing how much power our mind (and through it our self-talk) has. Use it for you not against you. Just listen to what you say  - are you helping and supporting or exhausting yourself (and others).  You’re in charge to control what you say. If you don't like some qualities that you have, change them. Through changing self-talk and self-image you can become the person you have always wanted to be. It's not easy but completely doable. It just requires dedication and work.

By awe, I mean a sense of wonder at the mystery of existence or the size of the universe--a sort of overpowering ecstasy mingled with just a little bit of melancholy or existential dread. So for example, maybe awe is what you feel when you look up at the stars, or into your child's eyes. If you're religious, maybe you experience awe when you feel the presence of God. Whatever awe means to you, and whatever shape it takes, I want to hear about it.

Your answer can take the form of a straightforward explanation, a story, a poem, a drawing, a video, a photograph, a song, or whatever else you want. It doesn't even have to be your creation; if a Beatles song makes you feel awe, then send me a YouTube link to that Beatles song. If someone said or wrote something which inspires awe, then quote them. Your answer can be anonymous or not, but I do at least want to know where you're from.

Send your answers to the email below, or go to Tumblr and search for the tag ""wonderserv"" for further instructions.

Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake                                         and dress them in warm clothes again.       How it was late, and no one could sleep, the horses runninguntil they forget that they are horses.            It’s not like a tree where the roots have to end somewhere,       it’s more like a song on a policeman’s radio,         how we rolled up the carpet so we could dance, and the dayswere bright red, and every time we kissed there was another apple                                                                       to slice into pieces.Look at the light through the windowpane.

I was mesmerized and I bought his cassette on the spot. The songs were old Tin Pan Alley numbers from the 1920's that were chock full of wit lyrical inventiveness. A few years later when I heard John Lithgow's ""Singin' in the Bathtub"" I had the same giddy feeling.

It seems like there is a doughnut hole in access to some historical music. Classical radio stations mostly emphasize music made up until 1900 and rock stations never play anything made before 1950, but there are many great songs from 1900-1950. Maybe you're like me and you sometimes get tired of the same three chords and the same story about couples breaking up. Maybe you also yell at your radio when you hear that Franz Ferdinand song that is ripped off of Led Zeppelin's ""Talkin' 'Bout Love"" or the One Direction song that is a copy of Sheila E's ""Glamorous Life"". If so, it's OK take a break and listen to some Songs from Halcyon Days (that was the title of ""Banjo"" Bob Sundstrom's cassette). Many of those old songs are more complex thought-provoking than a lot of the stuff you'll hear today and the beauty of Internet radio services like Pandora is you can discover this music easily. It won't force pop radio stations to include a few Cole Porter or Mississippi John Hurt songs when they make their lists of greatest songs of ""all time"", but you'll know they belong there. Now I think I'll go start up my Fats Waller station on Pandora.

   It is easy for each of us to get caught up in the minutiae of every day life. I have pursued posessions and sought answers in religion and in learned books but have returned to one simple truth - true bliss exists only in being of service to others. 

   It is not about any particular set of morality. We are all part of a global community. Our existence is made easier by that community and we are beholden to it and to each other. John Hobbes wrote about the state of nature being ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short"" and in order to avoid that we formed communities. Your life is made easier and better by your connections to each other and it is our duty and our privilege to support one another. The more we become connected and help one another, the more we all benefit. Call it selfish selflessness.  

   I find bliss in working with disabled individuals to help them find dignity and respect. I take this opportunity to ask each of you to take time in your lives to be of service to one another. It can be big or small. It will be easy to dismiss this email as another burden on you, but try for a moment to remember times someone has helped you. 

Please take this to heart and find some way to be of service to someone everyday, it will change you.

Right now many of the people I care most about are recovering in the next room. The ceremony was beautiful, the food was wonderful, and a 10PM noise ordinance means we will talk forever about the cops shuting down the DJ at the reception.

So here is my advice:

Love your family. You don't always have to like them, but love them when you can.

Don't stress the small stuff - it isn't a real party till the cops show up. (Or someone stomps off in a huff.)

Travel - many of the guests (myself included) traveled 12+ hours to this party and not one person regrets a moment of it.

Live in the moment - Grandma can’t remember anything that happened 5 seconds ago, but she spent hours last night in her chair at the party watching everything. She had no idea what was happening or who was getting married but she was thrilled to be at the party.

That said, I hope you all have a chance to be as happy as I am right now. I have my family around me, beautiful vistas of the mountains of Tuscon outside the windows, and nothing to do but bask in the post-wedding serenity until my 7AM flight tomorrow.

Become excellent at something. Then, teach it to at least two kids. You can learn the whole world through becoming great at one thing.

There is nowhere you are freer than in your own thoughts. Do not censor yourself in the privacy of your own mind. Allow yourself to think the unthinkable—neither shy away nor dwell too long.

If something makes no sense, think about it harder until it does.

When you are asked something, think until your second thought arrives, then speak.

The process of learning who you are is unsettling and unpleasant. Do it anyway. Know yourself. Nobody else will want to until you do.

Cultivate patience. Work on rhetoric—every language is beautiful.

Slow down. Quality is always better than quantity.

Predict negatively. That way, you will either be right (pleasant) or surprised by a better outcome (also pleasant). Either way, make an effort to appreciate the present.

The disease progressed and I started a downward spiral.  My high powered career and life began to crumble.  Loss mounted upon loss.  And I was consumed by bitterness and anger.

At some point in the distant past, there was no life on this planet. Now there is not just life but hugely diverse ecosystems and complex human societies. Some scientists believe that what happened in between was a series of highly unlikely coincidences, one of which resulted in the formation of the first cells. But I prefer a hypothesis that everything we see around us is just sort of what happens when the conditions are right. That when there is a source of energy and the right chemical nutrients, the progression from non-life to life, from simple to complex, is a gradual but almost inevitable one. That the deep interrelationship between life and its planetary environment (sometimes called Gaia theory) is as old if not older than life itself; that life did not cause Gaia so much as arise from it.

In Tokyo my job will be to work out some of the details of how complex, life-like phenomena can arise from non-living physical systems. The aim is not to create life but to understand something about it by studying things that are similar but simpler. For me, understanding nature on a deep and mathematical level is a way to unlock and appreciate its beauty. I am very lucky to have a job that allows me to follow this passion.

I haven't been to church since May, I'm questioning my thoughts on a lot of the Church's social doctrines, and I don't pray nearly as often as I used to.

I got some bad news from home recently about a friend, and only several days later did I even think to pray. Realizing that I had forgotten that astounded me, because in other times that would have been my first instinct. Trying to pray, however, felt no better. I felt weird asking for God's help--like a friend who hasn't called you back in months but suddenly needs a place to crash. I ended up calling my mom and asking her to pray, because I feel like my prayers have by now lost whatever potency they may have ever held.

If I'm going to be a lapsed Catholic, I want it to be a product of reading and honest questioning, investigating the philosophical arguments for Catholicism, really narrowing down what I agree with. Basically, I want to have done the legwork—not just have gotten lazy, which is pretty much what happened with going to church. Religion's a tricky thing. I know a lot of people struggle with this, and I'd love to hear about experiences from all sides of the argument.

P.S. If you're ever folding many sheets of paper (to make programs, for example), fold several at once, then separate them, stack them on top of each other, and press down on all of the folded edges together at once to make the initial crease sharp. Though it saves time, many people avoid trying to fold many sheets at once because the folds on the outer edge are never as crisp as you'd like them.

Very few people understand this decision. They think I should have sued him for all he's worth and destroyed his life. ""Why do you still talk to that pervert?"" they ask.

My answer is this: Because I understand what hate will do if I grab hold of it. It will lodge itself in every corner of my mind and soul and I will go through life believing I'm a victim and that things are happening TO me. I'll focus on what I don't have instead of what I do.

I must instead focus on the good and the love. My stepfather wasn't abusive, verbally or physically, in any way and, in fact, he was a damn good stepfather most of the time.

We are who we are not based solely on who we decide to be in any given moment but what society, people around us, and our environment TEACH us to be. Don't jump to conclusions about others. Rather, take the time and energy to understand why they do what they do and how they got to be who they are.

Look inward. Forgive yourself, forgive others, and put love out into the world.

Being a child, my dreams have always been, in order, of writing, being independant, travelling, and leaving the remote region where i grew up. I did that first, when i moved to Paris aged 19 to study. Then, i started a glamorous and promising commercial and marketing career in fashion that led me to live in Paris, Dubai, and Milan, and travel round the world. I have been lucky and spoiled, only to discover that it was time for me to start writing, and become independant. Few months ago, I have left a promising career to start my own business, and I am launching it next week. And guess what? It is all about writing! I am thrilled, excited, overwhelmed, and... scared to death!   Few words of wisdom from my experience so far: - take risks, challenge yourself. - everything happens for a reason. - write, every day. - people always expect more from you when you have curly hair.   Happiness is a decision. Few of my own little secrets for a happier life: - every morning, say thank you. - every day, give a compliment to someone you do not know. - speak words of love, focus on the good in people. - get rid of that guiltyness. - allow yourself some time to get lost, carried away. It's when I lost myself that I really found myself. - listen to That voice. - forgive, forget and surrender.

Needless to say it was a very expensive year but also incredibly rewarding and the spirit of musical adventure has stayed with me.

It started with a simple wish for this little IT Geek to get out more. I have a love of music – not just one style but the very thought of music fills me with joy. To that end I decided to go to every concert that I came across or heard about.

I went to music festivals, choral works, musical theatre and opera; to see blues and rock bands at pubs, country and western stampedes, jazz in the park, saw Leonard Cohen under the stars and cried as I heard Barber’s Adagio for Strings played live for the first time.

What did I learn? I learned to listen. Not just to music but to atmosphere, to the joy of those around me, to wonder at the incredible gestalt that can form between artist(s) and the audience and to rejoice in the ability to allow sound to fill your heart until you are sure you must glow with radiance.

To this day I still say Yes to music with three more events added over the weekend.

I hope that this email may inspire you to say Yes to a new experience in your life. The cuisine of the world is my next adventure.

For a while, I was assisting Jim Smith. Jim's favorite thing to draw is big muscly guys, a subject I'm normally not very interested in- but Jim combines his knowledge of every single muscle in the human body with an astonishing sense of grace and flow; his musclemen are things of beauty.

Looking closely at his drawings for an extended period of time, I despaired ever being that good. Until one day he brought in some ancient drawings from when he was a teenager. It was... not good. I looked at it, and something went *click* in my head. This art was pretty much EXACTLY as bad as the stuff I was drawing at that age. Except this drawing from 15-year-old Jim was a few years older than ME. And he'd been drawing EVER SINCE. He'd BETTER be able to draw rings around me.

That day, I quit looking at other people's artwork and thinking ""I could never draw that"". There are still things I can't draw, techniques I'm pretty useless at. But I know that if I really want to, I can spend a few years practicing, and I'll have it. I started getting a lot better after that realization.

Of course, I've been lucky to have the time and finances to pursue this. But that's a whole other message, isn't it?

In spite of wishful thinking, don't expect significant penetration any time this decade.  There is probably a role for EVs but it is not the widespread consumer market.  Rather, it is more likely to be various fleet applications such as delivery vehicles or limited urban transit applications.  For all but the most dedicated clean energy afficionados and hobbyists, or those who can afford a third vehicle, how many consumers can afford to pay the prices being charged for a vehicle with such limited capability?  Most cannot.  Second, there is still the issue that, in most places, the electricity used to recharge an EV will come predominantly from coal.  So, the environmental benefits, at best, are muted. But, cost and performance aside, there is another difficulty with an electric transportation infrastructure that few seem to speak about.  If you loved Big Oil, you will really love Big Monopoly Electric Utility extending its dominance to the transportation sector.  Gasoline prices have at least been shown to be sufficiently elastic that they respond to consumer demand.  And, within a limited range, consumers still have a choice of providers.  Hence, there is at least some semblance of a free market at play -- even if it is an oligopoly.  In contrast, a consumer's only choice for recharging that overpriced EV is the local monopoly utility and to pay whatever its regulator-approved rate is.  Good luck there.  So, there is a use for electro-motive transportation.  It just isn't the one everyone is talking about.

I have no wise words, no humbling story, but by no means do I live an unfulfilled life. I’ve found in my short, but fun filled existence that if you want to do something then you should never let things hold you back.

             I know there are certain circumstances which don’t allow you to fulfil goals and objectives, but surely there’s a way around them? A lot of the time we’re creating our own barriers that hold us back because were too comfortable in what we know. So I challenge you, the reader to go out there and do something different, something that gets you one step further to what you want out of life, and do it with a smile on your face, because as a drunken man once said to me “Why are you young ones so angry?”

             Another thing I’ve learnt so far is never to be jealous of others. It’s the easiest way to bring yourself down. Just be comfortable with what you can, or even can’t do and take solace in the fact that somebody will be jealous of you at some point.

We haven’t even come that far in our scientific understanding of the world, yet it seems to me that we are in danger of slipping back toward the times when scientists were feared and derided for their ideas, and churches and warlords made the decisions for us all.

I see it now all around: anti-vaccination movements, and anti-fluoridation movements, for example. Conspiracy theories and junk-science are beginning to over power public and private discussion. Even the very notion of intellectualism is no longer a desirable trait.

I’m thinking of Neil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist, who at one point said at that he isn’t worried so much about today’s children. Instead, it is the adults we need to worry about; the adults whom are afraid of the number 13, read horoscopes, and insist schools stop using Wi-Fi connections.

I have three requests for everyone:

    Don’t believe everything you hear or read, but be willing to trust the evidence of experts.    Be willing to stand up against unfounded and unreasonable claims made by pundits, crack-pots, and the delusional.    Enjoy and embrace the idea that we, as humans, don’t have all the answers, yet.

We’ve worked for national brands and hot VC-backed startups. And since our overhead is basically nonexistent, our full-service social media platform is available for a pittance of what one of the bloated agencies would charge.

So I told her that I had always believed my wife would take my name, that it seemed natural. That I would feel awkward otherwise. She talked about giving up that part of her identity and I pretended like I understood. I waxed on about starting a new family and how we would want to have the same name.

Here is the thing, though. On a really fundamental level the person that wants to have a conversation is always correct. She knew I was being an asshole (are cusses okay on this list? I waffled on the terminology but I was a real dick about the name thing) but instead of getting angry she kept talking to me, and I got it through my head that just because something is socially common doesn't mean it's not a burden.

We picked a new name, for our new family, and that's how we became the Maderas.

Whether the encounters were positive or negative, I have to thank them all because I am pretty happy with the way things turned out.

So take the time to reflect on where you are and how you got here. Think about the people that have mattered to you throughout this journey; then reach back. Maybe the phone call will not be as satisfying as you anticipated but who knows? That call might in fact be just what the other person needed to uplift them from a rough week.

We are afraid to make a decision since we don't know the outcome, and all this leads to mistakes that we prefer to avoid.

It would be great if our memory was like a hard drive, so we could store and recall anything any time, and if we could correlate all events from the past and see all connections.

This way, we could make no mistakes and precisely forecast the future.

But... our memory is not a hard drive, thus, it cannot work that way.

However, there is something that we can do to improve this:

- When you are preparing to sleep, lying in the bed, try to recall all events of the past day, exactly in the order as they happened, with all details. - If you are finished and still awake - try previous day, and so on. - Next morning, after waking up, briefly recall previous day.

In the end, you will feel the boost. Your memory will improve, you will begin to see the future, you will intuitively avoid mistakes.

But please, be patient - it could take days, weeks or even months, this is very individual, so don't panic if nothing happens quickly - eventually, it will - or money back :)

Unfortunately, much of it is not true.

Abortion: It’s not murder, and the penalty for causing a miscarriage against the will of the mother can be a simple fine (Exodus 21). Sometimes God calls for pregnant women (and the fetus) to be put to death (Genesis 38).

Contraception and masturbation: The Bible is silent on these issues. God killed Onan for coitus interruptus (“spilling his seed”), as punishment for refusing to impregnate his brother’s widow (Genesis 38).

Homosexuality: The Bible says all sex outside of a marriage is wrong and does not differentiate for homosexual acts. But in the same places it also prohibits eating shellfish, tattoos, divorce, wearing gold, wearing clothes made of two different cloths, and other rules absurd to modern society that the church ignores (e.g. Leviticus 11). Why aren’t they protesting retailers and seafood restaurants?

Marriage: While you may hear that the Bible defines marriage as “one man, one woman” (it doesn’t), it actually has examples of “one man, many women”, “a rapist and his victim”, “a soldier and prisoner of war”.

Wealth: Jesus says it’s hard for the rich to get into heaven, and people should give away all of their possessions. Not tax cuts for the rich.

Bible’s literal truth: Our modern Bible has thousands of changes from the original texts (read any Bart Ehrman book).

Don’t let people cynically manipulate you for their personal gain or prejudice.

They ended because I gave up on them; resigned myself to the fact that life was always going to be hard. So, I put my dreams on paper and figured out what I needed to do to make them happen. I wrote down what it would feel like to accomplish them. I'm not talking about buying stuff or jetting around the world. I'm talking about living!

And yesterday, exhausted, I almost gave in and slept. Then I saw this pinned to the board above my desk: “Don't give up what you LOVE most for what you WANT now.” My bucket list contains one item: I want to live someplace beautiful. Everything else will fall into place from there. Taking a nap in the miserable heat won't get me there.

I am not asking my question rhetorically.  I am a doctor, and I need to know.

A “code” is an emergency that sends a large team of doctors, nurses, technicians and others to a patient who is unresponsive, not breathing, or pulseless.  It is a frenzy of activity.  Unless a designated representative of the patient says otherwise, the team springs into action and determines whether to begin CPR.  The process involves much more than pounding on a chest for a minute, and that by itself can be violent.  Ribs are broken, and the patient rocks from side to side from the force required.  Orders are yelled across the room.  And if the patient does not begin breathing spontaneously soon, they may put a tube down his trachea and connect him to a machine that will breathe for him.

On television, the survival rate when something like this happens is close to 50%. In reality, a patient whose heart stops has about a 15% chance of surviving to leave the hospital.  Survival does not guarantee quality of life.  There may be brain damage or other problems.  This being said, an attempt at resuscitation is appropriate for many people--and for many others, it is not.

Your current state of health, age, and other factors affect your chances for a good recovery.  Depending on how things go, breathing machines, surgeries, loss of functional capacity, or rehabilitation may follow.  Think about this decision and discuss it with your family before you are hospitalized.  Ask your doctor if you need help. ""Five Wishes"" is a good place to start.

This may not seem like a huge thing now, but it was then.

The reason I bring it up now is because the institution he founded, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, is in trouble.

Take a moment and imagine what it would be like to be a prisoner in your body. You are unable to move, communicate, or even breathe on your own. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal column that control all of your body's voluntary muscle movements. Little by little, as these muscles weaken and die, you lose control of your body. Your cognitive abilities remain intact, and so the disease effectively traps you inside your own body until the end of your life. ALS is currently incurable.

A little over 2 years ago, my uncle lost his battle with ALS. The heartache it has brought to my father, my aunt and my cousins is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Since his passing, many members of our family have become active in the fight against ALS, which brings me to my heartfelt plea:

On October 21st I'll be participating in the ALS Association's Walk to Defeat ALS at the Los Angeles Coliseum. I'd like to invite everyone in the LA/Southern California area to walk with me! You can e-mail me for details about joining my team, let's harness the incredible power of this group to make a difference in the world! If you can't walk, please consider making a donation to ALS research. Together we can find a cure.

More sanitary, antibacterial, fresh smelling.5. Babysitting rooms at movie theaters. Gyms have them, why not movie theaters?6. Gear share program at vacation destinations. It sucks renting umbrellas and stuff when you go to the beach. Other vacationers who are leaving when you're arriving can hand off the stuff they used.7. Washers and dryers should be combined.

Here is most embarrassing moment:

About 6 years ago, I entered a 6km run. It was over farmland, in muddy swamps, along very muddy farm tracks and crashing through bushes.

At the end of the race everyone was totally mud-covered.

I went through to the changing rooms. Now, I have never really played team sports or been to the gym much… so was not very used to, or comfortable with the communal nakedness that a changing room presents. I have always been a bit body conscious, but really I was just not used to public nakedness.

I manned up though and went for it. Luckily I was the only guy in the changing rooms at the time, so I had time to compose myself. I took a deep breath and stripped naked. I looked quite a sight, all covered in mud apart from where my clothes and just been.

I walked into the next room where the showers were.

Nervously…but with new found confidence.

I turned the corner and found all the showers were taken and…that I was the ONLY NAKED GUY IN THE ROOM!

Everyone else was still in their muddy shorts, cleaning them as they showered.

None of the showers were free and everyone felt very awkward about my naked presence.

All I had to protect my dignity was a bar of soap. But I had committed.

I stood staunch until someone finally broke ranks and left.

I take this opportunity to thank that stranger

Thanks

I teach learning theories, motivational theories, and theories about working with diverse populations. However, I am at a loss about explaining the complexities of teaching in today’s climate. Do I tell my students the truth about how hard it will be? That they will work 10-12 hour days most of the year with pay that does not correspond to having a professional degree and license. That they will be told constantly that they must do or try one new thing,even if they don’t think it’s right for their students. Or do I tell them to remember their passion.

I began to feel like my time was running out. I felt helpless. But then I realized that worrying over this wouldn't change anything, and I decided to enjoy my life, however short, instead.

Look around you and see the ways you are safe, secure and empowered.  Regardless of your circumstances, there is good in your life.  See it, acknowledge it, enjoy it and be thankful.

Treat each person you meet as the unique individual they are.  Learn something from every person.  Notice their eyes; their spirit, their beauty.  Acknowledge them with a smile, nod or thought.

Become aware of your negative and judgmental thoughts.  Counter them with love.  Forgive yourself for actions that have hurt others. Vow to change the behavior. Forgive those who have hurt you because in doing so, you make room for love, laughter and joy.

Remember and honor those who have loved, cherished, protected, guided, taught, and, yes, even those who have pissed you off.

I could go on about actual scientific studies that link music to a whole host of physical and psychological benefits, but rather than rattle on here, try it.

A musician myself, I’ve played the piano for about half my life. I don’t profess to be any good, in fact I’d say I’m rather rubbish (though my friends & fans would likely say otherwise). In the beginning, I would do everything by rote. Always playing from sheet music, never improvising, and not truly understanding the underlying logic of what I was playing. It was not until I shipped off to college sans my mammoth sheet music collection that I first forced myself to try to play from memory – I recall repeatedly enthusing myself with the crashing  I-V-IV progression of The Who’s Baba O’Riley and feeling better than I ever did playing Chopin.

I’ve since found that by simply listening to music on a regular basis, I’ve become a better musician, and my life has improved too. I started writing my own tunes, and running regularly listening to music, getting into the best shape of my life. I put together a band called The Medicine (music is medicine, after all) and have a whole bunch of material that you can find under my own name (or username brtnlewis) on SoundCloud. I’d appreciate your feedback on my own creations, and any thoughts or musings on any of this stuff in general.

I was on the last leg of a road trip Friday, passing through El Paso on my way home to Austin.  Speeding along the highway, I looked across the Rio Grande and into Mexico.  It's nothing but a river that draws the line between these two countries, but that river's arbitrary contours divide wealth from poverty, safety from violence. It's just a river, but there's no question on which side you'd rather exist.

Isn't that dumb?  

I'm baffled by how much things over which we have no control shape our lives.  Race, gender, national origin-- these characteristics are all determined by the roll of some metaphysical die before birth, and yet drastically affect our life experience.  For me, being white meant the border patrol agents in Arizona didn't harass me. However, being a woman meant my heartbeat quickened when I walked past a group of men in an isolated part of Seattle.  

We're all assholes because we each possess certain unearned privileges that others don't, and probably don't reckon with that thought enough.  I highly recommend reading ""White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack"" by Peggy McIntosh and ""The Male Privilege Checklist"" by Barry Deutsch, if you haven't.

Questions:-I like this idea. What excites me is that someone might surprise us with something beautiful and true. One or two people have come close. But, does it matter if most emails aren't that great?

-If someone says something beautiful and true, someone will post that somewhere else, and it will go viral by the usual wonders of the internet. Why subscribe? Won't I hear about the amazing truth bomb in another corner of the internet?

-Is turnover high? People coming on for a week, then leaving. Does that matter?

-How is the listserve going to grow? It seems stuck.

-Usually, listserves serve a specific community of interest. What’s our common denominator? What similar themes have you seen in the emails?

-Also, usually, a listserve becomes a conversation. People reply, and we see the replies- good and crazy. There isn't really a conversation here. Does that matter?

Enough questions. All- I enjoy your random emails; life is weird and often sad. For me, it’s comforting to hear people express how they live. Thanks.

The thing is, my heart is broken. Literally. I have a genetic disease that deforms the heart over time, causing it to pump less efficiently, so every physical activity is more demanding. Every time I overexert myself I risk permanent damage to my heart, making the condition worse. I've known this for a while now, but I had been ignoring it and pushing myself to the limit nonetheless, just because I couldn't deal with the idea of reverting to my old unfit self. I'm slowly learning to accept my limitations, however, no matter how unfair they feel, and am trying to find a middle way that keeps me fit and protects my heart at the same time.

I want you guys to take a minute today to appreciate the wonder of this incredibly complex and fragile machinery we inhabit, which keeps ticking along day in and day out, without us even noticing until something goes wrong.

If we multiply them and add one, we get a new number, let's call it x. x can either be prime or not. If x is prime we have found a number, which is not in our prime number set, which was therefore not complete. If x is not prime, there is a number y, which divides x. But y isn't in our prime number set, because no number in this set can divide x. So also in this case the set wasn't complete.

I started the Couch to 5K program the next day and 9 weeks later was able to run the 5K faster than my friends, some of whom were experienced runners.

Having been able to do 3.1 miles, I was bitten by the bug. I began the Couch to 10K program, and then sought out other training programs online. The first weekend of January 2011, I was able to run my first half marathon. With 13.1 miles completed, there was only one other goal left to achieve. Ten months later, I was able to run the ING NYC Marathon with American Cancer Society's Team Determination. Less than two years after taking the running first steps, and with the support and enthusiasm of my friends, I was able to run 26.1 miles through the streets of New York.

I'm still figuring out how a lot of stuff works in life. I like to think that I get it right most of the times, but of course I fuck up a lot too.

I believe that's what it means to be human.

Here are some random tips/insights I've had that will hopefully improve your life or either give you something to think about, they did for me.

1) A clean house is one of the best things, but sometimes seems an impossible task. Just set out to de-clutter a little bit each day. I started by making my bed every morning, it only takes 5 minutes, but drastically improves the room. A mini-challenge: I'd like you to stop whatever you're doing right now, and clear off the nearest surface (be it a kitchencounter or desk) for the next 15 minutes… Go!

2) When people do shitty things and you call them out on their behavior, it's OK when it feels uncomfortable. The boundary you set makes them experience negative emotions and that is allright.- Likewise, if someone calls you out on your behavior, own your negative emotions. Apologize and allow yourself to feel shitty. No-one is a pro on how to interact with everyone. Rule of thumb: Don't do to others what you wouldn't like happening to yourself.

3) Love the people you love. Let them know that you care about them. Make it a point to let someone know today. And when you do someone a favor, don't expect anything in return, that's what favors are.  Olympia, WA, USA

There's a song that sums up what I think is a really important and simple idea that French author Simone de Beauvoir brought to life in her novel ""The Mandarins,"" through a Sartre-esque character, which is that, beyond any outcome or decision, people will still inhabit the earth. 

Please google the song ""People"" by Andrew Jackson Jihad (a clever historical name, considering his Native policies and ideas - - relevant to American moralism in relation to ""terror""). 

Let me know what you think.

Even if you don't, what I want to say here is a (couple) line(s) from that song:

And people are people regardless of skin. And people are people regardless of creed. People are people regardless of gender People are people regardless of anything...

This recent interest is a surprising development and so I’ve spent quite a bit of time pondering what it is about sport that appeals to me. I think it’s the possibility of transcendence - that none of us really know what we can achieve when pushed but that, in sport, sometimes we get to find out.

The Olympics has been a great opportunity to see this in action. Ten million people here in the UK watched Chris Hoy’s final race and all of us thought he’d lost his lead - and the race - coming into the final bank. But then, in what seemed an impossible moment of strength, he found something and pulled ahead to take the gold. In interviews, he clearly had no idea how he’d done it either. You could see it too in the utter surprise on Kat Copeland’s face when she and Sophie Hosking won gold or in Manteo Mitchell, finishing his part in a relay on a broken leg because he didn’t want to let his team down!

My own sporting achievements are rather more limited of course, but after a decade of inactivity I’ve now become a pretty committed cyclist, regular swinger of kettlebells and occasional runner. I’m the fittest I’ve ever been and have lost a shockingly large amount of weight. And the best thing is, I’ve no idea what my body is really capable of, or just how far (and how fast!) I can go. But watching the world’s athletes giving their all and exceeding even the massive expectations placed on their shoulders makes me wonder if it’s further than ever seemed possible.

I'd like to share a few heavy thoughts about you and me.

You are worthy of love no matter what. You hold no dark secret, no horrible regret nor difference of opinion that lessens your value. You are important, you mean something, you deserve love. Further, what you believe, think and do are significant. You and I believe some true and false things, but we choose what we believe and how we live. And these choices matter.

Despite our significance, however, something about the world still isn't right. And I have questions.

I believe you and I are more than smart animals, but who are we? I believe death brings more than nonexistence, but what? I believe the standard of right and wrong comes from somewhere outside ourselves, but where? I believe God designed us and allows us to mess up, but loves us anyway and saves us through Jesus Christ. I don't understand it all, and I have doubts and questions, but I believe it's true and means a great deal to you and me.

Thanks for your time.

I've spent the majority of my life working with computers and, recently, the web to craft web sites and applications for nearly every cause. I very much enjoy my trade as an art.  But what is art without a viewer?

I'm sure the majority of the people on this list spend a fair amount of time surfing the web.  I urge you to start paying attention to the details - appreciating the design and creativity put into it.  Corporate websites may not be the best canvas but personal websites and blogs often baffle me in design, user experience and expression.  Websites elicit emotion (too often mere frustration), convey a messages and provoke thought as effectively as a painting or symphony (atleast for us geeks).

So much of the web is tuned perfectly for your enjoyment - don't miss a chance to stop and smell the roses

I'm therefore going to use my one chance to speak to 21k+ people to urge you to heavily consider quitting smoking, if that's something you do. I've held the lungs of a [dead] smoker, and have operated on smokers, and the effects of tobacco on the body are not pretty. We all know the dangers and how tobacco destroys the living tissues in our body.

Understand this: quitting will not be easy. It won't happen right away. Talk with your health care provider to learn your options. Get support from friends and family who understand the battle that you'll be undertaking.

Reasons to quit:

-your risk of a heart attack halves after the first year

-your risk of cancer decreases by 50% after five years

-after 15 years, your risk of a heart attack/stroke is equal to a non-smoker's

-it's ~$200/month back in your pocket (enough to fund a decent vacation!)

-your teeth will be whiter

-food will taste better

-you and your possessions will smell nicer

-sex will be better

I encourage ALL my patients, including the 90 y/os, to quit smoking, as it's that beneficial. Check out cancerdotgov for more info.

All my life I have been fascinated by two things; movies and computers. I am currently 25 years old and am happy to say I have been able to include these two interesting topics into my daily life on a regular basis. Not only am I active as a software consultant, in my spare time I am also applying what I pick up at my job to my own interactive website about movies.

I have to say it feels really great to be able to combine two of my greatest hobbies in this manner, and I can recommend anyone to try to accomplish the same. Luckily it doesn't happen often, but when I'm for example not interested in programming for a while I can still work on the data for the website. Vice versa, I can optimize some underlying code when I don't feel like updating the list of upcoming movies or something similar.

I have been working on this project for almost a decade, although I only shared it with the world two years ago. Working on something for that long not only provides a steady basis to come back to regularly, it also allows me to try out different creative concepts. Whenever I discover an interesting new technique or idea, I can immediately apply it to this project that is always in my mind somewhere.

I can imagine some people experiencing such a long running project as limiting, but for me it works quite the opposite way. There is no golden rule that applies to everyone, but I do recommend to try and find several topics of interest to combine in a creative way. Perhaps you'll find something new and exciting to come back to now every now and then, who knows!

Let me share a part of my life with you. Exactly two years ago I started my current job. At a hostel chain in the Netherlands where - after being in social welfare for nearly a year - I was so happy to fine a full-time position. Which meant I would have (more) money, and would be able to leave my parents place again. To which I was more or less forced due to a lack of financial means at age 28…after having lived by myself the previous 10 years.

The last two years have passed swiftly. I have paid off all my student debts; poring nearly 1000 EUR in your debt the day your salary arrives feels awkward I can tell you that. (small note: fuck this debt-ridden consumptionism society). At work I have revamped almost the complete web infrastructure. Money is being made, and everybody is happy. But I'll leave my job end of August. I see question marks on the faces of all my colleagues: why leave before reaping what you saw? There is crisis out there!? It is time to move on.

To what, to where? I don't know. Having arrived at age 30 I thought the road to take would somehow be easier, contours would be more crisp. The exact opposite is the case… I don't have a clue, I'm totally fucking lost.

So I guess I might have some hard and/or confusing months ahead, but I think I'm ready for it. I've come full circle, and it's time for something new. I take comfort in the phrase I've just read on George profile (last night's couchsurfer):

Many of my friends and family have warned me, telling me it was very risky to be an entrepreneur, because I could fail, lose a lot of time and money. Telling me that it was much better to remain an employee, to be protected by the salary and social protection.

Finally, I did not listen and I created my own business  In the mean time, I realized that many people around me were dismissed because of the crisis while I still have my job, my company and I managed to keep my team. So being an employee could be risky as well, especially for aged people.

It's not easy but I am convinced that somehow I'll be able to do great things.  Above all, I am no longer dependent on others, I no longer need to find a company that suits me, nor a position where I am happy. I no longer need to communicate the relevance of my ideas, I just follow my intuition, think and act.

The future only depends on me, the energy that I put in what I do, my choices, the opportunities that I take, the mistakes I make and finally my ability to turn the luck into success.   Now I feel free, happy and master of my fate. And I think it will last forever

If you want to write poems the Seussian wayAnapestic tetrameter brooks no delay

But Seuss saw this form in its hard, rigid gloryAnd said ‘Hey, I can do it, and tell quite a story

‘While doing it, too, it will be my new toolIn telling kids things that they won’t learn in school’

When he came to a line that just wouldn’t quite flourishHe’d pluck up a word from thin air, and he’d nourish

That young little word, brand new to the worldAnd he’d place it in just the right spot, where it whirled

Where it danced and it sang like a fresh coat of paintOver language grown solemn and tempered and quaint

The words he invented were zong, zax and zillowAnd grinch, nerd and vipper, they were bofa and yekko

They told all the stories he needed to tellAnd they broke through a form that would otherwise dwell

In the musty old drawers of the humorless pastHe made it seem joyous, a form that would last

In the memories of every young kid who was readFrom a Dr. Seuss book before going to bed

And so, if I’m going to be true to my museI’ll leave with a moral that you all might just use

Dr. Seuss saw a dark thing and turned it to lightIf we all do the same, the world sure will be bright.

I wrote this few years ago when I had an inner battle with my faith. You know, the kind of thing that makes you ponder why life sometimes can be so unfair. I hope this will answer the question you've been asking the Universe.

For these past few weeks, I’ve been thinking a lot. I’ve been trying to find reasons. Answers for my why(s). Then I came up with this :

There is no such thing as free will. I never had a choice.

Even if there is, They always leave me with cruel choices They force me to make. I never had a choice.

I’ve had my time thanking the Universe. I’ve also had time blaming it on the Cosmic Irony. I’ve been through anger and I’ve also been to acceptance, back and forth. I got to the point where I could not go with this wandering-around-the-vicious-circle anymore.

Yesterday, it just occurred to me that I was wrong.

Choices. Yes they have always been cruel. Of course They would never give us the easy way with choices.

Free will. All this time, I’ve been closing my eyes and choosing to not see the big picture. It’s not about the choices or how cruel they are. It’s about the way you see them. That’s our free will. Choosing the way you see those cruel choices. It’s either you keep bargaining and angry with it or just accept and be grateful, for in the end whatever choice we made, it would turn on a dime. Sure the journey will be tough. But you can make it less hard by seeing them differently now.

There’s nothing you can do about those choices. It has to be made. Just believe that someday you’ll thank Them for the cruel path They’ve given to you for it helps you grow.

Many people have said things to me like 'I wish I could draw like that' or 'oh I would love to paint, but I am not very good'. I want to tell you a secret. Nobody starts out very good. No one draws their first picture and busts out an epic perfect still life. I have been drawing and painting for many, many years, and have practiced with teachers, models and taken classes. Anyone who is willing to put in a little effort can learn to become an artist. Sure, some people have natural talent, but that doesn't mean that you can't develop your own skills the old-fashioned way – with practice. Sitting down and creating something from a blank space is a pretty amazing feeling and I encourage you all to give it a go!

Two books that I thought were awesome resources were 'The Natural Way to Draw' by Kimon Nicolaides and 'Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain' by Betty Edwards. However, don't feel restricted by those books, go out find something cool, grab a pencil and just see what you can do.

I came back to I.T. after studying sociology and it taught me a lot about the dynamics of the role of I.T. in a company:

A good I.T. department is virtually invisible!

I.T. is in its core about infrastructure. They build and maintain servers and networks that people in their company use to do their job. That means, the default state of this infrastructure is that it has to work. Nearly every single phone call is about what is not working and that it should be fixed immediately. To manage this structure is a lot of work and if they do a good job, the phone won’t ring. I literally see my colleagues tense up and sigh whenever the phone rings.

This means that doing a good job is measured by the amount of phone calls they are not getting. If you consider that people who are drawn into I.T. tend to be introverted and shy, having their only contact from people of other departments consisting of complaints puts a real stress on their psyche. You may think that nerds are sarcastic, condescending or just not listening to you. And you may be right.

I think somehow a culture of ungratefulness developed within a company structure towards I.T. and it’s hard to change considering the length nerds go to avoid contact and just get working.

Just so they are invisible and therefore good at their jobs.

The trip also gave me my first 'raw' view of nature; from mountains in the sunrise to a deer that had been mauled by a mountain lion.

Most children will be assaulted by a relative or family friend, most women by an acquaintance. Teach your children to know a dangerous situation, rather than relying on “stranger danger”. Women should know that they are not necessarily safe when they are with people they know.

Conversely, enjoy the company of people around you. Do not approach everyone like they are a potential scam artist/thief/rapist/liar. Life is too short to view everyone as a suspect.

If someone has a weapon and says “Come with me or I’ll hurt you”, DO NOT GO! Where you are is much safer than whatever abandoned place you are about to be brought to, that’s why they want you to leave it. Throw a loud fit and run towards people as if your life depended on it (it might). Even if you are injured, you are in a populated place and will receive medical attention. Many people have been murdered and/or sexually assaulted by simply following instructions.

Love is a risk, but worth it. After exiting a marriage with someone who was such a compulsive liar that he was effectively a stranger, I thought I’d never take that risk again. However, after time (and therapy), I am lucky enough to find myself less than a month away from marrying the best partner I could possibly imagine.

If you live in a country that celebrates Halloween, let your children celebrate it as you did when you were young: scared and in the dark. “Safe” events aren’t the point of Halloween, and it isn’t fun for kids.

I have always been a textual person, a writer, and I wanted to unlock my visual imagination. What I experienced that sweet December night profoundly transformed the way I move through reality and engage with my fellow human beings. The visuals had very little to do with it.

While other elements of my late teenage life had edged open a door from the lonely, angry place I often found myself, it was that first dose of psilocybin that helped me step through. It is entirely possible that I would have eventually arrived at this place of joy and compassion without psychedelics, but the point is moot. They have been powerful allies along the path.

I harbor no illusion that psychedelics are a good idea for everyone. For many people, they may in fact be a very bad idea. They certainly won’t save the world. But they do have the capacity, when used safely and responsibly in an informed context, to better individual lives.

As non-profit organizations like MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) and the Heffter Institute increasingly receive federal approval for clinical trials into the therapeutic benefits these drugs can offer, and as psychedelics re-enter the mainstream consciousness of culture at large, I hope that the people whose lives they touch decide to work towards the betterment of society instead of dropping out of it.

Not expected to last the year, the publishers using the hatch/match/despatch model (HATCH: create a new comic title and an excited audience looking for issue #1. MATCH: Merge a successful title with a less successful title, joining the audience together - usually heralded with the phrase ""EXCITING NEWS CHUMS!"" and, finally, DESPATCH: Shut down publication of the lesser title, saving money)

Issue 2 of 2000AD featured the introduction of the character ""Judge Dredd"". Designed as an anti hero, Dredd, unintionally, turned out to have a vast appeal to the kids who read it.

I was one of them.

When I was 14 years old I loved comics and computers but, comics were derided and computers looked like it could lead to a day job (in fact, I started working in computers at 14).

In 2000, when I turned 30 and 2000AD, unbelievably still in print, was finally catching up with itself, having realised that all I ever wanted to do with my life was to draw comics, I pushed.

One year later I was drawing Judge Dredd.

When I was younger, there would be times that my mother's “intensity” would drive me to leave my home for a few days, just to get away from her. Every time that I left home like this, I would always do something different. One time I took a bus tour across the state, and another I merely spent the week at a friend's house. In one particular instance, I packed up my scouting gear and took off into the wilds of the Appalachians. After about 2 days of hiking, I came across a cabin in the woods. I had enough food packed and I really didn't mind sleeping in a tent, so when I knocked upon the door, it was curiosity that drove me. An elderly hermit named Mary Ykatherine then came to the door (it's a silent “Y” apparently). She treated me to what I thought was borscht, but what was apparently 85% peyote. I closed my eyes for a second after the meal, and when I opened them Mary Ykatherine was gone, and in her place was a gorgeous princess.

Thank you to the editor of the Town Journal in Ridgewood, NJ.  At 14, I sent you my book report on the Odyssey as well as suggested that I become the paper's next book reviewer.  You didn't laugh, but invited me into your office for a meeting, where you offered me the position.  I was elated.  You worked with me through awful draft after awful draft peppered with nonsensical words from the thesaurus because I thought they sounded fancy (and New York Times-esque).  You sent me long e-mails full of suggestions about how to improve my writing, and I took each one to heart.  I can't thank you enough for taking the time to work with me and allowing me to pursue what I thought was merely a dream.

Thank you to Kate Jackson of HarperCollins Publishers.  After I wrote an article in the Town Journal about my disdain for teen books, she wrote an editorial in response.  I then asked if we could meet and discuss our differing opinions on teen literature, and she agreed.  When we met, she offered me a summer internship at the company in the children's editorial department.  Kate and the team I worked with that summer were incredible, and it made me realize that writing will always be a part of my life.

My point here is that if you're young, don't be afraid to do what you love.  I used to think that I had to be of a certain age to accomplish certain things, but I don't think that way any longer.  Age isn't a barrier to accomplishments, and it doesn't define who you are.  Always strive to achieve, no matter how old you are.

I lost because maybe I hadn’t learned how to fight it right, or because I didn’t want to fight knowing I would lose it anyway.Actually I think I would have lost  much more if I had continued living the life I was living. The life that was mine and, like everything else that was a part of me, I hated with all my heart.I hope you understand that this was the toughest and selfish decision I have ever had to make.  I’m not gonna tell you not to be sad or angry, or cry. I just want that the only people who do it are the ones that really cared when I was alive. If my life wasn’t worth it, please make sure that my death is. I want to thank those who loved me, no matter how: be still because none of you could have stopped me if you tried. I’m in peace now.

I think you know a lot about someone when you know what they find the funniest. When you make somebody laugh a lot, you have complete control over them. It's an interesting power trip to know that you've reduced somebody to a blubbering mess. So tell me, when was the last time you really, really laughed? Mine was when this happened:

Last year our cat Piffon died. He was a big part of the family, although it was a love/hate relationship - he had the most annoying meow you could imagine, a whiny guttural sound, like a scarred infant crying for help or something. And he was a total coward too, not one of those cool cats you hear about who kill mice. Once we actually saw him getting chased by a bird. Anyway, he was getting very old so my mum and sister took him to the vet, who explained that he had lived a long life and it was best for him to be put down. My family, despite their sadness, agreed that it was best. On the way home, my sister had Piffon's body on her lap in the car, her and mum both crying as they drove. Then suddenly, his dead body urinated profusely all over her!

Tears of grief turned to tears of laughter - it was Piffon's final revenge against the family who so lovingly despised him.

First, a little about myself: I am an American guy in my lower twenties. I live in the center of the state of Pennsylvania, and, on the weekends, run a small take-out BBQ. This particular job involves lots of prep work and any needed welding and fabrication to keep things in good shape. Now, as stated before, my intention is to lecture the world about something. This isn’t something terribly life changing, but if you eat meat, you should know this. Use a meat thermometer! People regularly ask me questions about cooking, and when they do I usually ask them a few questions myself. One thing I find is that most people rely on some primal instinct to determine whether their meal is ready. The usual outcome is that otherwise delicious cuts of meat get overdone. There is an easier way. For about $10 you can have a tool that will tell you exactly when your food is done, every time. No more relying on some formula or a pop-out button to determine if that turkey is done, folks. Stick a thermometer in there! If the center is up to 170º, it’s done, otherwise, it’s not. No poking, prodding, test cuts, or other guesswork. A thermometer is certainly the cook’s best friend. (Tip: don’t cut that turkey right away. Cover and let cool for 10-15 minutes)

A contemporary view of intelligence finds that it is the sum of two factors:

G(f) is fluid intelligence- the size of your working memory, how ‘fast you think’ etc.

G(c) is concrete intelligence- a measure of how much factual information you have acquired.

Learning more information then is the key to greater intelligence.

Hart and Risley (1995) found that children in non-working households heard, on average, 616 words per hour, while children from professional families heard 2153. By the age of three this totaled a difference of 30 million words. Less well off children are exposed to fewer concepts- and develop less concrete intelligence.

Research into memory and cognitive neuroscience has soundly shown that the learning of new material is much more efficient if you already know a body of linked material.

Eric Hanushek’s work suggests that a good teacher can get 1.5 years of learning growth in one year, a bad teacher 0.5. The consequences of a bad teacher for a number of years in a row can be devastating. Note that many of our most challenging schools struggle to attract good teachers.

Finally, we know which classroom practices most enhance learning and achievement. We have a well-developed science of learning- but you’ll have to look very hard to find proof of this in our schools. It’s long overdue that schools, classrooms and teachers applied what works, and the folk pedagogy and traditions that guide our educational institutions were replaced by evidence-driven practice.

It is the week prior to a festival I help organize: FarmFest. Let me tell you why I love this festival so much.

I grew up on a dairy farm in Friesland, the Netherlands. Throughout our upbringing, my twin brother and I spent a lot of time together - building tree houses, doing chores on the farm, playing games. Both my brother and I went to study: he moved to Utrecht, while I moved to Amsterdam. I am currently finishing my Masters, and he decided move back after his BSc. He's going to continue the farm when my parents quit.

Most friendships from back home have watered down through time. I only see my twin brother when I go back to visit the farm, and many other friends I only see on special occasions. Fortunately, there is something that brings a group of us together every year: FarmFest. 

10 years ago a couple of friends and I decided to celebrate our birthdays together. We got some bands, lots of beers, and invited friends. Saturday July 14th we will throw the tenth of these gatherings, which we named FarmFest. This festival has grown from a few dozen friends to more than 500 people, who come to listen to bands, bbq, drink beers, dance, and relax around bonfires. Every year we improve something: better audio, a larger tent, a second stage, more bands.

Yet, the most pleasure I get from FarmFest is not the party itself, but the preparation. In the months and weeks before FarmFest my old friends, twin brother and I get together and try and figure out how to organise a festival. And let me assure you: creating a festival with friends is the awesomest thing in my life. Because of the festival, I get together with my old friends and we renew our friendships by working together. 

What brings your friends together?

The Loneliness of Extraversion On a recent Sunday morning, I slept until my eyes were ready to open, rearranged my apartment, ate cake for breakfast, and read online news in total silence. I did two loads of dishes, returned library books, and watched bike polo in the park. I then found my favourite tree and sat under it to think about how amazing the previous few weeks had been.I hadn’t had a day without social interaction in more than two weeks, but Sunday, when I finally had some time to myself, I found that I would keep looking at my phone and try to decide whether to text or call or email or chat or bbm or ‘like’ activity or comment or message people. Amidst the solitude I had been seeking I still sought out the technological company of my peers. Sharing these experiences with people is what fuels my life, but the problem with being an extrovert, and a busy, well-liked one at that (cry me a river, I know), is that in the moments when you’re not surrounded by love and friendship, you feel very much alone.

Empty spaces seem bigger. The quiet seems quieter.

Eventually, after resisting the thumbscializing cycle of Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and G-chat, I succumbed to the compulsion of checking what was making that red light blink, and I responded to a few of the alerts adorning my status bar. Though I don’t regret doing so, I am glad I was able to hold off on them until I had appreciated my surroundings. These lonely moments are necessary, particularly to an extrovert. We function by way of external stimulation, but if we don’t give ourselves the time to wipe the slate clean, we’ll just be trying to catch up with the alerts of the stimuli that just happened an hour ago, a minute ago, a second ago…

Extroverts! We need some time off! We need to trust ourselves that whatever activity we choose for the hour, afternoon, or even whole day, will be the BEST one. During the times when we turn our phones to silent or better still, leave them at home, we will be significantly more capable of being the best participators in activities, because we give ourselves to them fully.

Notes on muffins:Fresh ground spices are THE BEST. Get a microplane for ~$10 and you'll be set.Nothing in the world smells as good as fresh ground cinnamon and nutmeg.

Having fresh baking powder is important. It reacts with air and loses potentcy.Muffins are chemically levened by the reaction between the acidic buttermilkand tartaric acid in baking powder and the basic baking soda.

Muffins get their texture from being roughly mixed. You only need to mix untilall the flour is wet; any more and you risk developing gluten strands andmaking your muffins chewy, with a cake-like crumb.

July 2012,15,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/07/15/a-story-about-music-youth-and-culture/,"July 2012, 15","A story about music, youth and culture","This is a story about music. It is also a call to arms for anyone interested in recording. Forward it to anyone it might help.

A lot is said about DIY music, and plenty more about mainstream artists. But this is a story about the rung beneath all that; a rarely mentioned rite of passage for anyone who has performed a note of music in their life.

When I was 12, a youth club opened by our school. It had a music room where a member of staff showed me how to play a simple drum beat. I didn't 'get' music as a kid, but then they started playing along with the baseline to 'Smoke on the Water'.

Something clicked. It was a huge rush, and I feel it again as I write this.

A decade later I was taking a degree in music production. My classmates wanted to be songwriters or DJs, but my love for bands like At the Drive-In and Fugazi led me to a certain music culture based in Washington DC through the 1980s. There is plenty of literature describing DC's punk heritage (everyone from Beastie Boys to Moby were part of it), but it was essentially a community defining their own identity through DIY record labels and live shows.

Through an academic lens, I picked apart why this movement worked. It needed a town to call home, a live music venue to draw people together, a studio to document their efforts, and a bunch of people who are more interested in music than money. And then I remembered the now-defunct youth club I used to visit.

So a week before graduation, I put myself to work. I wrote a proposition on the Sunday (I find the funding, you provide the space, we create an environment where young people can use music to build their own community), drove across the country to my hometown on the Monday, changed into a suit in my car and walked into the council offices with a freshly-stapled business plan.

They said yes, but only if I can find the funding. Councils never say no to funding.

I could write a book on the next part, but you'll have to settle for a summary. In one month I raise £25,000. Twenty per cent becomes a part-time wage. I order £22,000 worth in equipment, but negotiate it down to less than £17,000. We install a very competent recording studio with a rehearsal space, and let these ingredients simmer to see what happens.

For many young people, it was transformative. I'm reading through the old case studies now, and I'm fondly reminded of calls from teachers seeing improvements in class, or the mother whose daughter just seemed happier at home. Words like 'confidence' and 'ability' keep appearing, and I'm struck again at the story of the boy with Aspergers who wouldn't sing until his third week. These examples only skim the surface, but it was significant for all of those involved.

Two years later, I left the studio in their capable hands. The teenagers it was built for had taken charge of their own ship, and I had achieved my life's first serious ambition. My next was to become a journalist.

I'm telling this story for a simple reason. I think it could be replicated in hundreds (maybe thousands) of towns around the world.

All that fundraising, studio engineering and management was hard work, but you're already connected to an internet which can guide you. Hell, I could recommend a tonne of books that would tell you everything you need to know. They worked for me.

Do you know someone with enough drive to make it happen too?

Is it you?

If so, send me an email. I still have all the business plans and equipment lists, and could throw in a bunch more tips to avoid certain pitfalls.

Maybe some of you will take it on, and maybe culture will be a little richer for it. Who knows.

As for me? I'm working from home and enjoying family life in the English countryside. I've learnt that you can do anything if you plan it right and work hard. You can talk and talk, but nothing happens until you get up and do it.

Tell me what you were anticipating to be stressful at work today, or what you are looking forward to doing this evening. My favourite question to ask is “What are you passionate about?” It stumps people most of the time. This upsets me because I don’t like to see a disconnect between someone and what makes them the most happy and curious in life. Your passions should always be within arm’s reach. Once I get the ball rolling and someone begins opening up to me, I like to think that I’ve lightened their mood and distracted them from whatever negative thoughts were tossing in their heads. Maybe when they’re done speaking to me, they continue the conversation within themselves. Perhaps they had lost touch with what they are passionate about and I helped rekindle their fire.

I initially wanted to write about what was a long distance relationship between my boyfriend and I, but is now local. 286 days in our first year were spent with him in Ottawa and me in Vancouver. I’m also passionate about science (physics, biology, evolution), hockey, Sweden, feminism, body positivity, blood donation, and awareness of depression and anxiety.

So tell me: What are you passionate about?

I want to start interacting with the readers and writers of the Listserve by sending emails. Maybe it’ll become a passion of mine.

So much seemed to be wrong in so many parts of the world - I didn't know what to do, I just knew I wanted to do *something*.

Yet changing the system seemed impossible for millions to bring about, never mind one angry teenager.

5 years ago, a small thought changed my life.

I realised 'the system' - with its business, jobs and money - is not the problem. It's just a tool.

Most use that tool to prosper regardless of their impact on others - but you don't have to.

I started a business that finds ways to use the web - something I knew a lot about - to improve lives.

We make a profit so we can pay fair wages, and reinvest what’s left into doing more good.

This is a “social enterprise” - it puts people, not profit, first. I think the world would be better if every business were replaced with one.

I'm not noble or brave enough to give everything I have to charity - or to fly to a more needy country to lend a hand. But every day I do a job that I know makes the world a little bit better instead of a little more unfair.

I'll never make much money from it.

But I feel rich - and a whole lot less angry.

But paradoxically, as ever more novel communication technologies are emerging, there are serious breakdowns in meaningful communication.

The United States shows an ever-widening schism between political left and right who refuse to even talk to each other, let alone compromise in tackling national challenges.  Blogs are hyper-partisan, speaking only to the true believers and reinforcing their preconceptions.   Social network tools like Twitter and Facebook are great for chatting with friends about inconsequentialities, but actually decrease our tendency to pay attention *outside* our social circle.  When is the last time you used social media to change the mind of someone who disagreed with you about something that actually mattered?

I signed up for The Listserve to help me think about tools that could enhance communication among strangers.  It's great to communicate to a huge group of listeners.  But what's next?  How could this turn into a multi-way conversation?  What about a blog where one random person posted every day but everyone could respond in the comments?

I'm a sociologist, working on two very specialised areas - the sociology of hevy metal and the sociology of the British Jewish community. Needless to say, there aren't many of us working in either area. I'm really just a reasonably big fish in a couple of pretty small ponds. So for the last few years I've made a joke about being such a big fish in a small pond. I've said that really I'm just like 'the best water skier in Luxembourg'. Needless to say I didn't know anything about water skiing in Luxembourg. But about a year ago I had a brianstorm: why not go and meet the best water skier in Luxembourg? Why not write a book about him/her and about other big fish in small ponds too? The idea seized me with excitement. This could be a polemic against power and celebrity, a celebration of the unknown heroes in obscure small worlds, a tribute to commitment and community. So I've been working on the book. I actually met the best water skier in Luxembourg last year and I'm preparing further trips to visit such other obscure figures as the Icelandic special forces, the top novelist in Suriname and the best heavy metal band in Botswana. The book is being crowd-funded so I need the help of strangers to complete my project.

Figure out what representative (and by representative I mean anyone for whom you can vote to hold public office) best represents your views on the world, how you want the world to be, how you see the world progressing, and vote for them. It’s quite simple.

Over half of the subscribers to the Listserve have elections coming up in their respective countries, but this email isn’t just for them, it’s for everyone to keep in mind. Having a voice in shaping the future of your country, however small you think it may be, is something truly revolutionary. Indeed, few times in the course of history have conglomerations of people been able to direct the fate of their nations, and as such, this right (to vote) should not be taken for granted. Of course, people differ in their views for how they think their countries should progress, but in closing I think this quote from Voltaire will be to most people’s liking: “I may not agree with what you have to say, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it.”

Twice a year we would take some of them to an outdoor adventure centre where we would climb, tunnel, drive quad-bikes etc. It was awesome. And very dirty. Hence we would shower the kids every night.One boy I worked with, who was about 8, had various digestive medical conditions that resulted in him wearing a nappy and often suffering discomfort. At the end of one day he was in a toilet cubicle both undressing for his shower and using the facilities. Suddenly he called out to me, in a lot of distress, that his bottom was stinging (This is not the funny part!). I hurried him into the shower and rinsed him down with water relieving him of his agony. He was very thankful and continued to shower as normal.Many weeks later, I was helping out in his classroom when out of the blue, he said to me Do you remember when you were in the shower with me and I was crying because my bottom hurt?3.

Why not try to understand the world for all its intricacies?

I love life.  I am privileged to work and live in a very progressive environment.  It is mind bending to think how far we have come as a society in such short period of time.  We are tolerant and accepting as a majority, but then again, I live in a bubble.  Individuality is ripping from the seams of conformity.  We are breaking into our own unique mold, yet unite as a whole.

As far as parting advice, be honest to yourself and be honest to others.  Surround yourself with people that love and support you.

Love always,

And then it appears in your inbox asking to speak to hundreds of people. Some of whom will read and smile. And some of whom will think you're a blithering idiot. And some will think you have something interesting to say. And some will delete it without reading. And some won't understand.

I'm only about a week away from turning 40 years old. An age that sits solidly in what most consider middle age. Ancient to the 20 somethings and younger, in the prime of life to those already there and past. I'm not concerned with getting older. I enjoy the experience, the knowledge, the gift of being able to say that I'm closer to a half century of existence than not.

But I haven't done anything spectacular. I haven't devoted my life to curing childhood cancer. I'm not a famous politician or entertainer. I'm not a stunning businessman or scientist. I'm just fairly ordinary.

And that's okay.

I have a calm life, one that is creative and interesting. One that doesn't make for a good answer to that question of 'what's new?' or 'what do you do?' at parties, but one that leaves me generally content.

And that's okay.

So dream big, Do All The Things, but it's /okay/ if that Big Dream is something little and not earth shattering. There's nothing wrong with content.

Actually, to tell you the truth, I am not that interested in saying something and am really just interested in the effectiveness of The Listserve as a platform for communication.

Email gets a bad rap these days and the reasons are good: we get too much spam, it is too easy to abuse with mass forwards, overuse of the carbon copy feature, and packed inboxes overwhelm users.  Many students of mine never really used email in the first place, choosing SMS, IM, Twitter, Facebook and the like to telecommunicate with their peers.  (My fear with all of this is that we are segmenting and tying ourselves to proprietary commercial platforms (at least in the case of IM, Twitter, Facebook maybe not with SMS) without even considering the repercussions.)

I love the constraints that The Listserve puts on the messages.  No links, no rich text or images and so on.  Back to the basics.  Our only mode of interaction is the reply button.  Fantastic!

So, if you will, humor me and send a reply!  I would love to see how many of the 20k+ that I am writing to will!  I'll email you back with the data and some of the comments after a week or so.

I'm writing this from my hotel room in Auckland, New Zealand. First trip out of Australia and I'm loving it! 

Last night we dropped in to The Shakespeare for a quick beer on the walk home.  Wow, What a pub! They brew their own beer in behind the bar. If you're in the area I highly recommend it.

Brewing beer is a very rewarding hobby which I recommend every beer lover try at least once. I don't mean those tins of extract you get from the supermarket, brew it from grain! The experience really helped me enjoy some of the excellent craft beers available to us now. 

I tried the 'brew in a bag' method in a large pot on my stove. It only brewed about 24 bottles but they were mine! I had a great time adding the ingredients and seeing how it changed the flavours before and after it was bottled. 

The first pour and taste was so rewarding, I had no idea if I had done it right or wrong or what to expect. To have this beer that I crafted myself from raw ingredients was the best thing ever. 

Go on, give it a crack. It'll only cost you about $50 to get set up and a day of your time.

I taught problem solving as a high school math teacher. After the vision, I moved to Portland to get a PhD in systems science, and in two years when I finish my dissertation, I'll be traveling the country to foment a (r)evolution.

 

I was teaching the students a basic four part problem solving method:

 

HAVE a problem.

IDENTIFY what you KNOW

IDENTIFY what is NEEDED

STRATEGIZE what to do

SOLVE (act on the problem)

VERIFY that the problem is correct.

 

Then I noticed something interesting - these items form a set of recursive domains, 'meta' if you will. People move smoothly from having a problem, to filtering it towards a goal, towards planning and then acting, and after acting, reflecting.

 

Then I noticed that this is a fundamental relationship in the processing of groups - whether we talk of group identity (Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing) or the way in which Portland, OR has processed through the building of a new I-5 bridge (ODOT declares a problem, neighborhood mtgs, design meetings, construction meetings, construction!)

 

This basic pattern is nothing less than the operating of the hivemind, a prosaic and yet fundamental relationship in how humans compute. I believe that change in possible in my lifetime, and that I'll be the one to foment that change.  Look for me traveling the country under the Dead Letter brand knitting people together into a shared network, under Meta, with personal motivation and interesting projects for all.

Here is why I think this needs to happen: - Basic understanding of science helps people be better citizens of the Earth and our modern global society. - Real science must be open, conducted with open tools. Science education should be like real science. - Existing open source technology (Arduino, Raspberry PI, etc) is orders of magnitude cheaper than proprietary science education tech. Harnessing this technology could vastly lower the financial barriers to entry for educational institutions worldwide.

All we need is some good software and hardware designs to make it easy for educators to use. Who's with me? If you are passionate about open source, science, or education, please get in touch and let's make great things happen!

Like many others, I didn't expect to be selected this early, so here's something I learned from Bruce and Sophie. Who are they, you ask? Well, they're my cats. And before you file me under ""Crazy Cat Guy"" I want to share a couple things that I didn't

know before I adopted them.

- Cats are obligate carnivores. - Cats are desert animals, and as such, they don't have a high thirst drive. - Cats on an all kibble diet do not drink enough water and are

more prone to being dehydrated. - Dry food is has a really high percentage of carbs that cats dont really need.

How did I learn this from them? Well Sophie had some stomach issues that wouldn't go away, regardless of the brand of food I fed her, so I went into research mode and read about cat nutrition and such. As a result of all this, I moved them both to a strict canned food diet and then I started making their food at home. Yes, homemade cat food. Raw chicken with extra additives that they need. The net result of this? Her stomach problems vanished pretty much overnight. Not only that but both her and Bruce's coat is super soft and shiny,

there's not a person who pets them that doesn't comment on it.

I don't expect everyone to start making their own cat food because that's just unrealistic, but for all of you cat lovers out there, think about switching them to an all wet food diet, at least. Its not as convenient and is a bit more expensive than dry, but it's way better

better for them. Canned food has a far higher protein content than dry, as well as having a lot more water to it which will help keep them hydrated, this in turn will help keep urinary tract diseases at bay. Not only that but most canned food has about 4% carbohydrates in it, as opposed to 30% or more on dry food.

So please, look into it. Wet food is the way to go. Don't take my word for it either, google ""cat info"" and the first hit will have lots of info on the subject, read up on it, the site is maintained by Dr. Lisa Pierson and is an invaluable resource.

Your kitties will thank you for it. You wouldn't eat junk food your entire life, and neither should your cats.

The collective consciousness of society would browbeat one into thinking that most others are inferior and inherently competing for something like honor or recognition.

It's a good thing that isn't true.

This listserve, like the real world, is a better portrayal of how much more kind, thoughtful, and accepting people actually are. Of course, we aren't utopian yet, and I see things in people's characters that I think to myself often, but now have a place to widely broadcast!

The founder of western philosophy said, ""I know one thing, that I know nothing."" Yet many people I meet (including myself) can think that there's something you know, something that sets oneself apart, that somehow lends authority to judge or critique someone else's beliefs, actions, or decisions.

May I humbly suggest that none of us know the inner workings of every human heart. Religious zealots may have been indoctrinated, the poor may be so because they support others, and the classically uneducated may be wiser than their lack of a degree may evince.

If I could share something from my life experience that I think could help all of you, it would be to not only to treat people justly and rightly, but also with respect. I've had personal experiences with people who, in retrospect, have been astonishingly wiser than I, but who were easy to dismiss because they had learned that wisdom is its own qualifier, and weren't competing for something as fleeting as honor or recognition.

Senior year, I had to write an essay, one conveying a sense of time and place, in the style of Joan Didion. Inspired by my respect for the professor and enthralled by Didion, I wrote a harshly honest account - my struggles with weight, food, responsibility - and anger at parental pressure. peer pressure and career pressure.   The title, ""Often, That Problem Is Mine,""  referenced a joke between my friend Scott - also in the class - and me.  The totally awkward, poorly-constructed sentence summed up everything we wrote and thought about, while mocking the passive, unmanly writing styles we had certainly transcended.  

My professor gave me an A and encouraged me to publish it.  He seemed truly enthusiastic, convinced it would make a great op-ed in the New York Times.  

Lacking confidence, and still fearing parents' wrath, publishers' rejection and professional repudiation, I demurred, dodged and dropped the idea.

But there's only so much it can do. There are some words of a language which remain untranslatable. Here are some of my favourites:

Duende (Spanish)- On a translator, it'll show ""elf"". It is actually the spark of divine inspiration, expressing itself out of one’s heart, or the involuntary feeling of awe, in reaction to an inspiring piece of art or music.

Tenalach (Gaeilge)- The relationship one has with the earth, the air, the water. A deep connection that makes you one with nature.

Gemütlich (German)- Translates as ""comfortable"", but it is the sort of comfortable exhibited by a warm house full of people who love you; when you are happy and relaxed.

Ya'aburnee (Arabic)- Literally translates as ""You bury me.""  The declaration of one's hope that they'll die before another person, because of how difficult it would be to live without them.

Koi No Yokan (Japanese)- The feeling you can get when meeting a person for the first time, that you will fall in love with them. Different from ""love at first sight"", as it does not say that love already exists, only the knowledge that it WILL happen later.

Estou mais para fim do meu curso, e ultimamente tenho pensado o que eu vou fazer depois de formada, mas isso é uma preocupação pra mais adiante.

Agora uns tópicos mais aleatórios (ainda!) pra fechar o email:

 assista Greys Anatomy, How I Met Your Mother, Community, White Collar, TBBT, Modern Family, Raising Hope, New Girl, 2 broke girls, Parenthood. A  lista é grande, mas vale a pena, eu garanto! :)

Leia todos os livros do John Boyne, principalmente O Palácio de Inverno. É ótimo!

Assista Uma Linda Mulher, é excelente!

E pra fechar, sempre pense duas vezes antes de agir, e tenha sempre fé, seja em alguém ou em alguma coisa.

I am going to have to write this quickly because I am really busy! My flatmate and I are organising a Eurovision party and people will be arriving any minute. Check out wikipedia if you don't know what that is.

My name is James and I am English. I live in Barcelona which I love. Some people say I'm lucky to live here but anyone can do it if they want, it just takes determination and a little bit of sacrifice.

I've not had a Eurovision party before but I think it will be fun, if a little camp! I recently moved into a new flat and have done a lot of work to make it a home. It's nice to be able to enjoy it with my friends.

I'm feeling very happy at the moment. Maybe partly because the weather is good and I can spend time on the beach. Work is going well and I am getting on well with my friends. I certainly didn't feel so happy during the winter, but then it always makes me a bit depressed.

The only downside is I find it harder to eat well and have put on a couple of pounds. It is definitely worth the sacrifice!

I guess the only thing missing is ""that special someone"", I hope I'll meet them soon. Maybe I already have.

Take care, James x Saturday 26 May 2011 Barcelona, Spain"

I have something I'd like you to do.

Think about a project you've been wanting to finish — perhaps something important, or perhaps something small. And ask yourself… why haven't you done it yet?

Today, I want you to put aside whatever's standing in your way. Finish that project. Even if it's not perfect, there's always time to fix things later.

The biggest barrier to success is often fear of failure. But that's okay… it's better to try often and fail, than to wait for perfection which will never come.

Perhaps you were intimidated; maybe you didn'tknow where to start.  Maybe you tried, but got frustrated.  Maybe you had grand plans that would have taken you years of concentrated effort to pull off.

Here is a thing that I am learning: It's okay to do it badly.

So your stick figures aren't even recognizable as people.  So you knit a rectangular scarf that's somehow not a rectangle.  So the birdhouse you built is wonky.  So the program you wrote crashes if you look at it funny.  So you painted an ugly picture of your father in his underwear in a recliner.  So the curtains you sewed sit funny on the rod.  So you only know two chords on the guitar, and it takes you a few seconds to switch between them.  So you made a video-game that's ugly and weird and broken and nobody wants to play.

Do something that you're bad at.  Enjoy it anyway.

Maybe get good at it, if you want.

Indeed it has been, I have really enjoyed receiving all the emails.

I've decided I'm gonna tell a story. In summer 2010, I went backpacking for a month in Indochina with my mate, Eston. On one bit of the journey, we left Phonsavan in Laos at 6am in the morning and travelled all day to get back into Vietnam. We arrived at Vinh at 8pm in the evening, and caught yet another coach to Hoi An after waiting around for two hours.

So, we were on this coach, seated on the back row, exhausted and grubby. The driver came round the bus and gave us blankets, which we placed on the seat next to us. Two teenage boys, around our age got on and sat next to us. We couldn't really understand each other but they offered us gum - very friendly guys. We gesture and converse monosyllabically for a bit.

This coach was a bit different, it had a large space between the last row of seats and the penultimate row, large enough for a mat and for people to lie down, which the two boys did. I fell asleep and woke up in the middle of the night and in the darkness of the moving coach, I saw one of the Vietnamese boys kneeling and relieving himself into a plastic bag held by the other boy. Oops. I didn't want to be rude and stare so I closed my eyes again, opening them again to see the bag being flung out of the open window. Then I saw the other boy using one of the blankets to wipe the floor. I'm guessing he spilt the bag. The boys shifted elsewhere on the mat, away from the wet spot and went back to sleep.

Later I woke up again, this time, the driver was chasing the two boys away from lying down (it was a long ride so I assumed he was rotating his driving shift with someone else). He appeared to scold them, and then after they moved back to their seats, he lay down on the mat – right over the 'wet' spot!

At this point I was stifling my laughter, terrified the driver would smell something and accuse Eston and me. I don't think I would have been able to remain poker-faced in the face of interrogation. I was also really glad I didn't use the blankets given.

But seriously, I had a great month of travelling. If you ever get the opportunity, do visit Indochina, especially Laos!

June 2012,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/06/05/a-few-things-to-remember/,"June 2012, 05",A few things to remember...,"1. Watch for bikers and runners when you drive.  Too many accidents occur because people are making a simple turn and are in a hurry, and forget to look to see who else they share the road with.  If you see a biker or runner, don't forget to check where they are before you turn in front of them, otherwise you could turn right in front of them and badly injure someone (not to mention put a nasty dent in your car).

2. Don't drink and drive. It doesn't matter if you've only had two drinks.  If you think you're okay to drive, wait a half hour to be sure.  The next time you think about getting into a car, think about if you found out when you got home that your son/daughter/brother/sister/best friend was killed by a drunk driver.  Just don't risk it.

3. Help others.  One of my favorite quotes is by Shirley Chisholm: ""Service to others is the rent we pay for our room here on earth.""  It doesn't matter who you are or how hard you've worked to get where you are, someone out there has fewer opportunities than you.  Everyone has someone else to thank for where they have gotten in life: your parents for raising you in a good environment and working to give you a college degree or good values, a teacher or mentor who helped you realize your passion, a nameless patron who donated scholarship money or gave you a job.  But not everyone receives the same opportunities, and everyone at least deserves to be fed, to be educated, to have a roof over their head.  It may seem that one person can not make a change, but one person can be a friend or make a small difference in one other person's life, and that's all that matters.

4. Send a card or letter to someone you care about, just to let them know they matter and you are thinking about them.  Not tomorrow, do it today.  Tomorrow might be too late.

We went to the Zoo, and the Powerhouse Museum (absolutely fantastic for a young kid into technology and science like I was and am), and many many other places.  Most importantly, we were spending time as a family.  I look back on the trip with the absolute fondness of memories.  And with a little regret.

Not about the trip, no, let me explain.  We were heading back to the hotel after a long days adventuring.  My brother and I could be a little bit (ok, a lotta bit) of a handful when we were young, and this particular day was no different; So you can understand why when the train arrived at the station, I just stepped on.  Or rather, into the gap between the platform and the train.

I don't remember much about it; what I do remember is falling, and in the same instant a fist grabbing my t-shirt from behind and pushing me up onto the train.  My ankle and knee was sore and my eyes were filling with tears as Mum snatched me up and took me to seat.  Dad was shaking the hand of the man who had saved, at the very least, my leg.

I remember laying on the hotel bed watching cartoons as Dad iced my leg.

My regret is never being able to thank that man for saving my life; or at the very least, saving my leg.

It's not clever, it doesn't rhyme, it's not grandiose. It's eloquent and on point:

DesiderataGo placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant, they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.

If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.

Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let not this blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is as perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

Therefore, be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams; it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful.

Strive to be happy.

You’re a bit stressed: it’s absolutely normal. But let me just tell you a simple thing, and everything will go just fine. In a matter of days, the Indian in you will be fully awakened.

The head tilt.

This is a very simple gesture: just tip your head from side to side with a small angle (around 15°), repeatedly. Don’t make it start at the top of the head; your chin should be driving the movement. Limit yourself to three or four tilts, in a fluid movement. Got it? Yes, you’re doing it right.

You just learnt the secret to Indian communication. A stranger is talking to you in an unknown language? Just concur, using your newly learnt skill. Congratulations! You successfully communicated. Look at the visible satisfaction in your new friend’s eyes.

Huh? You still don’t understand what it means? You’re puzzled by this taxi driver’s use of the gesture when you give your destination? Was it “yes”, was it “no”?

No, you’re not getting it: it doesn’t have a meaning, because it IS the language. Does English have a meaning?

But the comparison with English stops here. The tilt head is much more powerful. What other language allows you to communicate “I reluctantly agree to the price you have given me, but be aware you get all my contempt” with such concision?

Warning: Excessive use of the tilt head may severely impair your communication skills back at home. Use at your own risk.

Water for Elephants by Sara GruenThis is one of the most engaging stories I've read. It follows a young man who ends up working in the circus, but the best thing about it is that it also follows his life much later on in a nursing home. The way the two stories intersect is fantastic.

The Book Thief by Markus ZusakThis is about a girl during WWII told from Death's point of view. Nothing else is like it. It will break you heart, but it's worth it.

A Walk in the Woods by Bill BrysonOr anything by him. He's hilarious.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas AdamsIt seemed obligatory to put this on the list, as Towel Day was so recent.

Since so many others have given life advice, I feel as though I should do so as well. The only advice I feel comfortable giving comes from two video bloggers, John and Hank Green, who changed my life and introduced me to the best community in the world. Google them, check it out.

I love the concept of the group and I love receiving each day's email. So far I've learned so much from so many strangers - drink recipes with ingredients I would never have thought of, more information about bees and beekeeping than I ever thought I'd learn, the list goes on and on. 

While I always hoped that one day I'd be selected to send out an email - I didn't expect the time to come so soon. To me, the chance to email almost 20,000 people in countries ranging from Belarus to Cambodia to Lebanon to Nigeria is an incredible one. It's the 21st century equivalent of being given a microphone to talk to a massive audience of people from around the world, people that you'd never normally meet. A really amazing opportunity, but also one with quite a bit of pressure. I have to be honest, when I received the email yesterday afternoon, I panicked. What could I possibly tell people that they didn't already know? I'm 22 years old - how many incredible life experiences do I have that would be inspiring to 20,000 others? 

Some of my favorite Listserve emails so far have been those that contain inspiring pieces of advice based off of the sender's own experiences. I just graduated from college and I'm at a point in my life when I feel very young and very old at the same time. I have my whole life ahead of me, but now it's largely up to me to determine what my future will look like. I know I have a lot to share, but I also know that I have even more to learn. So, accordingly, I decided to solicit members of my own family - ranging from grandparents to aunts to parents to siblings - for pearls of wisdom that they've learned throughout their own lives. I figured that it might be more worthwhile to share inspiring quotes based off of over 250 years of experience, than just 22.

Below are some of my favorites:

""Walk through life being pleasant and kind to everyone you meet, knowing that your kindness will not only make someone else's life better, but also your own."" - Morrie Zimring

""Keep on going, even if you feel like there is no tomorrow."" - Susan Sale

""Those who bring sunshine to the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves."" - Muriel Zimring

""When you lose, don't lose the lesson."" - Miki Zimring

""Everything you're looking for lies behind the mask that you wear."" - Miki Zimring

""Sometimes it's shit till it isn't shit anymore."" - Lori Sale

""An unsolicited opinion is hardly ever heeded or valued."" - Scott Sale

Earth is no more than a pale blue dot, hardly to be seen against the cosmic background.

The insignificance of our planet in the truly fascinating happenings of the universe becomes more clear, when trying to comprehend, that the Milky Way, which can be seen on a clear night, is in fact what a spiral galaxy looks like from the inside! It may contain up to 400 billion stars – one of them, is our sun.

And then, on one of the sun's planets, there are humans. When contemplating the irrelevance of every single being on earth against the immense numbers that the universe provides, our mind protests, that this can not be so. But with all the evidence we have from hundreds of years of exploring the night sky, we have to come to the conclusion, that it is.

Some people feel small because the universe is so big. But in our each and every life, there is no time to mourn our humble existence, nor to believe that of all possible life forms in the universe, just we are the selected species. Let us accept the fact, that we are a very small part of the universe and concentrate on our life and the lives of people we love and care for, making our home planet a more peaceful place to live.

After all, we are forced to get along together. There is no way of escaping our home planet and, as yet, there is nowhere else to reach besides our pale blue dot.

May 2012,28,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/05/28/worry-less-do-more/,"May 2012, 28","Worry Less, Do More","It's often said that the biggest obstacles we face in life are the ones we put up for ourselves. Unnecessary worry is one of those.

How many times have you denied yourself an opportunity because of worry - maybe you felt like you weren't ready, or that you didn't deserve something enough?

If the answer to that question is “never” then you're very lucky indeed but most people  have held themselves back on many an occasion. Personally, towards the end of last year I was holding myself back to the point where I was hardly doing anything new or creative, stuck in a self-imposed rut.

I'm not saying we should try to never worry about anything, because it's perfectly natural to worry sometimes, and certain things in life will always cause anxiety.

What's important is to learn to realise when we're worrying unnecessarily and devise strategies for dealing with it in a productive way.

Those strategies will be unique to you, so you'll have to work them out yourself. It's really easy though – all you need to do is take a little “quiet time” whenever you feel worried, frame your worry into a statement and then come up with a logical solution.

For example:“I'm worried that if I go for a job interview I might mess it up and make myself look stupid”Strategy: “So I will make sure I'm fully prepared for my interview and perhaps roleplay with a friend so I can practise”

Quite often I find that just turning a vague worry into a definitive statement makes the solution obvious.

Of course, sometimes you really aren't ready for that new job, or physically fit enough to run that marathon – but at least this way you have some kind of action plan.

Once you have the hang of dealing with minor worries in this way, you should find that you'll spend less time thinking about doing stuff, and more time actually doing stuff.

You won't always succeed, but if you're worrying less and doing more, failure is just a side effect of all the awesome new things you're experiencing rather than a crushing defeat.

Thanks for reading, I hope you'll join me in worrying less and doing more! I'd love to hear about your thoughts and experiences so please get in touch :)

The instant feedback is addicting and we almost feel like we can touch and experience life in the same way we would if we were physically together. Sometimes the virtual is a good substitute and other times, there is simply nothing that replaces the feelings and the ideas that can flow during a conversation had within a single room. However, the more time we spend in the virtual, the easier it becomes to dismiss the value of coming together in physical spaces.

While working away deep in the virtual, an interdisciplinary group of friends brought me to join them in POPSHOP, the place where we go to work, play, talk, sleep… sometimes, and most importantly work together physically. It’s a place where we can build, where dreams are celebrated, but only if they are followed up by action. Where ideas are great, but not as great as the process of building, of showing others, even if not for monetary gain but for the physical feeling of building. It is our firm belief that the only way to really move quickly, is by sharing with others and by allowing them to help catalyze growth. Leveraging the knowledge of others not for an explicit reciprocity, but an implicit one. Being together physically not only lets us better share our ideas and help each other, but it actually has a really powerful effect. It is that extra level of commitment that drives us to not only talk about our ideas, but take action and make sure we achieve our dreams, and when we get stuck have people around to help us move forward.

So poprightin online to see more and make sure you physically get together with a group representing diverse ideas and skills, to see how much more you can achieve.

P.S. I wrote this in the POPSHOP with the help of some of the awesome people around me.

But there’s a story behind that.

I was tree planting one year. While planting you need to move fast, the more trees in the ground the more money you would make. I was never all that great at it but I stuck with it and at the very least I kept going.

One rainy day, on a hill surrounded by tree stumps and torn up branches, I threw my shovel into the ground to open up space in the dirt for a little tree but as the blade of my shovel came down a frog hopped onto the path. The shovel came down onto his shoulder.

The frog’s arm was cut off. Not completely, though, there was a small flap of muscle/skin hanging on (if you’ve ever read Harry Potter, think of Nearly Headless Nick) and the frog was wriggling around on the ground, likely in a lot of pain.

I was a little shocked. I stared at the frog a little while, and it never made a sound. I looked around, walking a few steps to see if someone was nearby. Probably for moral support, but I hadn’t really thought that far ahead. I didn’t know if I should try to kill the frog, knowing that with it’s injury it would be easy prey and have difficulty moving around to get it’s own food. I decided to go back to check on the frog.

He was gone, somehow moving himself back into the brush. I still wonder if his arm wasn’t as bad as I thought. Either way, he'll figure things out for himself.

I’ve had other tragedies in my life, ones that easily surpass the armless frog in the scale of life changes and impact, but the frog gave me things to think about, which turned into something that I learned.

The memory of that frog comes with me every time I take a step forward. Bad things will happen, you must remember them but don’t ever stop moving forward. Things will sort themselves out as long as you do.

He’ll remind me, when things get troublesome, to keep hopping.

It’s kind of funny —I am an eighteen year old boy who should be basking in what’s left of my youth, but I feel like I am a middle aged man with nothing but repetition left in life.

Wake up. Go to school. Go to work. Do homework. Eat. Shower. Sleep. Repeat.

I mean people have warned me that life out of high school sucked, but no one could have really prepared me for this. While my peers are out of state at some fancy University, having the time of their lives partying, drinking, and networking with a variety of people.. I am here, stuck on this rock, going to a community college, and living paycheck to paycheck.

I was told that doing great things in high school would amount to great things out of high school, but that was just a way of getting me to go to class. I’ve done sports, I was a vital role in the school’s yearbook, I was enrolled in advanced placement classes, I participated in numerous clubs (service/leisure), I have held leadership positions in those clubs, always went out of my way to volunteer, and I even represented the state in a national competition and placed 3rd overall.

All these things may have been a great experience for me, but it just sucks knowing that it all amounted to this. Here I am. Stuck.

Although my life isn’t the greatest at this moment, I like to look at it knowing that it could be worse. I mean there is always someone out there in the world that has it worse, just as there is always someone in the world who has it better. This sort of gives me a modest way of looking at life: I am not walking around with my nose up in the air nor am I moping around hoping everyone takes pity on me.

As for the quote above, I don’t really know what Picasso meant by it. I’m guessing that it takes a very long time until you actually get to understand the meaning of all of this crap. And that it takes a very long time for you to actually enjoy life because we have to work for it.. That you know, we will have the opportunity to be ‘youthful’ when are have finally made a name for ourselves. When we stop trying to please everyone and start doing things just for the hell of it.

While typing this, I’ve realized how dull my life has become and that’s just no bueno. So although life has been stressful let’s try to remember the fun in life –and let’s not get all caught up in this shit. I think with a balance of work and fun, time will be that much bearable.

Nevertheless, this is my contribution, and it will hopefully be of some kind of use you!

When I got the mail about being selected, the first thing I had to do was to decide what I wanted to write about. Should I tell a story? Write about my life and ambitions? Tell about the company I am starting? Why I think my education is awesome? Or why I love developing for Android?

It was a hard choice, but I finally made up my mind – to tell something I usually don't write about, something I know I am admired for all bragging set aside.

So I chose to write a little about my way of life, and why I think it makes me the one of the happiest guys in the world.

Sure, the past 26 years have been mostly great for me, but there has sure been some lows down the road already. But no matter what has happened I have kept my spirits high, and with a healthy faith in life I have made it all the way till today. To put it in a little perspective, here is a short summary of one of the worst weeks of my life so far:

It started out great, with plans to go the Crete with my beautiful girlfriend for a week, taking of Sunday morning. On Tuesday some idiot broke in to my car an stole a lot of stuff, including my laptop (yeah, it was hidden) and set me back around $3500. On the following Saturday one of my teeth started to hurt, and at around 8 in the evening I couldn't stand the pain. The result was a root canal, a canceled holiday not covered by the insurance because it happened before I left the country in total setting me back another $2000. And all of this while being a student having $900 a month for everything. But I kept my spirits high, because there are more important things in life.

And what is it then? Well, it is kinda hard to explain, but basically my philosophy in life is stay happy. Not at any cost, but if there is something to be happy about, why spend time moaning about what has gone wrong? It kinda works like this; when something goes wrong, I focus only on the good things that results from whatever and let the bad stuff happen as something that need to get done to get to the good stuff. For example, I was just glad that the lady at the emergency room gave my both penicillin and very strong painkillers that got me through the night, and that the dentist gave a completely painless root canal the day after leaving me with a fixed tooth and no pain at all.

So, what I am actually trying to say here is that life is awesome, and if you can control the way you think about things, you can actually stay on the good side of almost anything. It works for me anyway!

Be positive, and spread it with a smile! It WILL get you further!

Ready? Ronward!

1. A day of workI just got home a little while ago. A lot of my work consists of getting on the phone and talk to people. Sometimes, on these calls, I get pissed off and the forked vein in my forehead bulges (I know this because yesterday I was on a Skype conference call, and the vein popped out when I was trying to make a point that seemed really important at the time. I should probably get my blood pressure checked.) The window in my office looks right onto a lawn; a small woods starts at the edge of it, and beyond, there's a river. Every so often, when I'm sitting at my desk, two or three deer leap out of the foliage and nibble at leaves. I take pictures of them with my camera phone. Generally, the pictures do not turn out. 

2. This is NPRListen to THIS WHOLE SHOW: Radiolab, Season 6, Episode 2 'After Life'Be obsessive about THESE 14 SECONDS: Radiolab's original open, particularly the part where the lady says ""and this is NPR"".

In 1987, I was at a civil rights march in Cumming, GA (Brotherhood March II).  I was grabbed by a coordinator towards the end- I was told to flank the woman next to me who was with a child in a stroller; there were people on the ridge next to us throwing rocks and bottles and screaming obscenities. As I tried to turn my body into a shield I directly faced these people screaming the most hateful and violent words I have ever heard uttered. I thought I had understood racism and prejudice. I understood nothing.

I was becoming enraged. I wanted to fight back. As I began looking for a rock or anything, a chant was growing in the stream of marchers; I expected a confrontation until I heard what they were chanting. To fight the shouts of ""Nigger Lovers"" and ""You will Hang"" was a chant of ""We Love You"" in return.

I didn't understand. How can people met with lifelong hatred and discrimination act in return with Love? In the face of people threatening to kill you, they reply with ""I Love You"".

I broke inside. I collapsed. The people around me grabbed me, pulled me up and helped me to my feet. I heard the words beside me ""It's okay brother, I have you"" and I regained my footing and made it to the end.

There is a picture of me sitting on a curb shortly afterward looking exhausted and dazed. 25 years later I am still exhausted and dazed.

I try to inform everything I do in my life with this experience- the morals I raised my three amazing daughters with, how I still to this day try to make changes in this ever-broken world of ours.

There are so many awful things that humans do to each other. I truly believe they can only be resolved with a genuine love and caring for each other. Unequivocally, everyone should have the same opportunity to equal treatment under law, clean food and water, safe housing, health care and good education. And mutual respect. I have not ever heard a single argument to lead me to believe anything other than this.

This is the underlying theme of the Occupy Movement. It's about everything really. But most of all, it's about love and respect for us all.

Email me if you want to read some of my poems.

Much Love and Respect to you all

What IF we could end hunger? 

What IF there was enough food on the planet RIGHT NOW to feed every human being? 

Well, there is. And we can end hunger. Fascinating, right!? The generation being born right now is the first in our history that may see the basic needs of every human being met. 

These are things that, once you know, you can't un-know. These are things that should inspire us all. These are things that - at Impact Foods - give us purpose. 

Impact Foods is a small food company in Dallas, TX with a big dream - to see the day when no children are hungry. 

For every bag of granola we sell, we feed a hungry child. We do this through our partnership with the World Food Programme. We help end the cycle of hunger at three critical points:

1) 1,000 Days: We target hunger in the first 1,000 days of a child's life, where damage done to the brain by malnutrition is irreversible.

2) School Meals: Then, we provide meals in schools - which boosts community attendance by more than 50%.  This program allows children to receive nutrition as well as an education. 

3) Sustainability: Our hunger work is done in a way that treats the problem, not simply the symptoms. Our ultimate goal is to break the cycle of hunger through not only feeding children, but educating them and giving them thriving communities and self-sustaining economies so that companies like Impact Foods no longer need to exist. 

But for now, they do need to exist. And we want to encourage you to start a conscious capitalism project of your own. Our passion is hunger - what's yours!? 

Sure, we'd love for you to buy a bag of our delicious all-natural granola when it hits the shelves of Whole Foods this August...but really we want to to think about today's question:

What IF.

He's all about the Fox News, Bill O'Reilly, Tea Party and Ann Coulter. He rants on about immigrants, taxes and President Obama. He sends my husband and me crazy emails with ""facts"" about various minority groups, how universal healthcare will doom America to socialism, why we need to drug test poor folks on welfare, that sort of thing. We generally avoid engaging with him about all this stuff.

But, seemingly incongruously, he doesn't hate on the gays. He doesn't believe that gay folks are degenerate or sick, or make substandard parents, or should be singled out for anything. There's a refreshing absence of conspiracy theories about gay agendas. He doesn't bust out his religion to support discrimination. In fact, he's pretty progressive in his thinking that lesbians and gay men should have the same rights and responsibilities as everyone else -- I think he believes homosexuals are, for the most part, just regular folks doing their thing.

He became my father-in-law when I married his son back in 2008, when gays could marry in California. He and his wife welcomed me into their family with open arms. Now, after nearly eight years together, my husband and I are in the adoption process. We are starting a family, two dads and a baby, with friends and family. We will teach our daughter or son our values, a few of which might be very different from his. But when it comes to equality, love and respect, I can say we'll be upholding a tradition.

May 2012,16,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/05/16/david-evans/,"May 2012, 16",David Evans,"I’m going to tell you about an inspirational person. He loved to push himself to the limits, the sports he loved were always ones where he could use his brain, expeditions, climbing, bouldering, kayaking, orienteering, he maintained his nerdy ways.

I don’t want to give you the wrong impression that he was really intelligent there was that one time we drove all the way to a festival for the day, he got out the car and realised he had no shoes on ‘Oh shit got no shoes on, we’ll have to go back’, that was kind of stupid.

He did use his intelligence to get a degree in Mechanical Engineering and teach children Kayaking and climbing, but I liked to remind him of the stupid moments more than these.

His determination and complete love of life led him in so many directions, being a DJ, learning to fly a plane, and all the while he wanted to better himself. He came back from India and wanted to learn so much about spirituality, religion and philosophy, he had a desire to know why we were here.

He always wanted more, more adventure, more knowledge, more achievement.

You would never guess this on a night in Liverpool when he would turn into the craziest party animal. One night, he was dressed up as a paramedic for a fancy dress party, ordered a pint of Red Bull and a pint of vodka, dancing the night away to techno taking a gulp from each one in turn.

I could spend hours telling you about his life but put simply he was just so nice, and kind and hilarious, someone everyone of you would love to have as a friend.

David Evans is my older brother, he died 1 July 2011 in Chamonix, France in a climbing accident. He was 24 but lived such a meaningful life that inspires me everyday to live my life through and for him.

David’s advice would be what his tattoo said, he would tell every single one of you with a huge smile on his face and in his deep scouse accent ‘Learn from yesterday, live for today’.

And If I could tell him one thing I would answer his question of why he was here, I’d say that he was here to infect so many lives with the love, determination and inspiration that guided his.

Instead, I'll introduce you to my Congo African Grey parrot, Bagel. Greys are considered one of the most intelligent species of birds, with an amazing ability to mimic speech, identify objects, and even do arithmetic. Google ""Alex the parrot"" after you read this email and you'll see what I mean.  

- So, why ""Bagel""? On a chilly Saturday morning in late December 2011, my boyfriend and I were at a loss for lunch options, per usual. We were headed east to the F train when we turned around because I decided I wanted a bagel from Brooklyn Bagels. One thing led to another, and we found ourselves at our local Petland Discounts playing with a beautiful baby African Grey*. It was only appropriate that we name our New York-born-and-bred bird after our prized breakfast staple. 

- Does she talk? Most definitely. She came home knowing how to say, ""hello"", ""oh boy!"", and ""I love you"", and mimicking a smoke-detector and aquarium bubbler. Since coming home, she's only picked up gibberish, curiously enough, including ""wee goo"" and ""bagel poopah""; she has also learned to mimic coughing and a door squeak. The other day, she said some indecipherable things in a deep masculine voice; I think she picked it up from PBS, which I leave on when I go to work.    

- Does she get to go outside? Yes. She's been outside a total of ~8 times, and mostly in the Chelsea area. She's also been to the Upper West Side and Fort Greene. She's still learning how to fly, but we do have a parrot harness ready for when she grows out her flight feathers. 

- Where can you find Bagel? On my shoulder around Chelsea. Or, on Facebook, Tumblr, and Instagram with the handle ""bagelparrot"". 

*Disclaimer: Bagel was not an impulse buy. I grew up with birds and had been on the market for a parrot for a while. While African Greys make amazing pets, they are so intelligent and sensitive that they may resort to self-destructive behavior if they do not get enough attention. They also live until 60, so be prepared to write them into your wills.

I'm a student, and I can't really cook, so I think the best thing I can do is send out a couple of really simple to make (yet still quite nice) recipes. (It might give some ideas to other students out there!)

First one: Toad in the Hole. This one takes about 35 minutes from start to finish, incl. cooking time.

Ingredients:3 fat sausages1 heaped teaspoon white flora / trex / oil (or another cooking fat)1 large egg3 fl. oz milk2 fl. oz waterPinch of salt

1. Heat your oven to 220 degrees2. Put the sausages in a roasting dish, and put in a heaped teaspoon of white flora (or something similar like trex). If you don't have anything like that, I've found oil works ok too.3. Put them in the oven for about 10 minutes.4. While they're cooking, put the flour, salt, egg, milk, water, and salt in a bowl together and whisk it together until all the lumps are gone. I usually need to scrape around the side of the bowl with a spoon to mix in the stuff that sticks to the sides.5. After the sausages have had their 10 minutes, pour the batter over the sausages and put it back in the oven for about 20 minutes.6. Serve with whatever you like! I like to eat it on it's own, but I've been told that's weird.

Second: spicy beef meatballsThis one isn't as simple because it needs a spice mix called ras el hanout. They don't sell it in the supermarkets around the university, but I usually pick up a pot from waitrose when I go home, and it lasts for ages. I've included it here anyway because it's really nice (it's a favourite of all my flatmates). It also takes a bit longer to cook, about an hour and 20 altogether.

Ingredients:20 small beef meatballs200g cherry tomatoes1 large onion2 tsp. ras el hanout.

1. Heat the oven to 180 degrees2. Chop the onion up, and put it in the dish with the tomatoes and meatballs3. Sprinkle the ras el hanout on top4. Cover with tinfoil and put it in the oven for an hour.5. Take the tinfoil off, squash the tomatoes and give it a stir.6. Put back in the oven, without tinfoild, for another 20 minutes.7. Take out and serve with pitta breads!

Finally: cookies!This is the simplest (and one of the nicest) cookie recipes I've found.

Ingredients:100g butter100g sugar1 large egg175g plain flour1/2 tsp. baking powder1 big bar of chocolate (I like dairy milk best)

1. Heat the oven to 200 degrees2. Mix together the butter and sugar3. Mix in the egg4. Stir in the flour and baking powder5. Stir in the chocolate6. Cover a tray with tinfoil/greaseproof paper, put the dollops of the mixture onto the tray, and cook for 12-15 minutes.

That's all I have! Hopefully this will give some ideas to at least a few of you.

I have thought often about what I might write to you.  I was so terribly excited to finally have the opportunity to say something to you. You know? To really make a difference.  To impart upon you some great piece of wisdom.  To share some new information with you.  

You have already shared so much with me, and I know that I will be learning so much more from you. So what can I do for you? I believe in treating others how you want to be treated.So, maybe I can make you laugh?

Here is my favorite joke: George: Have you heard the one about the snake in the golf hole? Lisa: No, I haven't. George: Neither have I.

As you can see, joke telling is not my forte. The faces that I make to go along with the jokes is where my comedy lies ( I apologize if I did not use the correct form of that word...it's confusing).

What else can I share with you? I love to bake. I often substitute coconut oil (cold pressed organic virgin) for half or all of the butter to change the flavor profile and perhaps make baked treats a little healthier. I also add a tablespoon of high quality baking powder to any recipe calling for chocolate.  This always adds a lot to the chocolate flavor!

I think what I want to share the most with you is my passion. Truly and deeply, I am an artist and want nothing more than to share art with you.  Specifically, I would love to sing you a song I've written.  Since I can't sing to you, I  thought I could write down the lyrics to a song I recently wrote. You can imagine a melody, write another verse, paint a picture, make a sculpture, or ignore it. Whatever suits your fancy.

I don't remember what it was called or what activities it offered, save one: a classroom filled with hundreds of craft supplies where you could make anything you wanted. This room had fabric, pipe cleaners, paper, paints, glue, wood scraps, wire, glitter, pottery, plastic shapes… and so on. It was a kid's dream come true and I spent quite a while in the room, creating things. I don't recall what I made, but I do remember my awe at all the cool stuff in that room, and I wondered why there weren't more kids in there taking advantage of it.

Today, I work at a company that is just like that room full of goodies, but for adults. It's called Sandbox Industries.

Sandbox is an entrepreneur's dream come true, just like that classroom was a child's. If you are fortunate enough to become a Founder-in-Residence at Sandbox, you're free to start your own company - anything you can imagine - and make use of Sandbox's metaphorical room full of craft supplies to do it. Our Startup Foundry offers development, design, copywriting, finance, PR, and social media services to entrepreneurs so that they can build whatever they want from scratch. In other words, we give founders the tools they need to start a business, and all they need to do is be creative and enterprising enough to use those tools to their advantage.

It's amazing to see what happens in an environment that is truly creative and collaborative. These entrepreneurs aren't competing against each other. They're working side-by-side toward a common goal, which means that they learn from each other's successes and mistakes as well as their own.

When I first started searching for jobs, I had no idea there was anything this cool out there. I stumbled into Sandbox by accident, basically. And it got me to thinking… What other amazing things are out there?

I hope that, if you're not excited or satisfied by what you do, you find the place that is as fun for you as Sandbox is for me.

It grew to be a notorious, magical, wild concoction of various mind-altering substances. Each successive year I would study nature and try to learn more about plants, natural aphrodisiacs, and things that could effect our emotions in a positive and loving way and I would experiment.Some years were definitely more successful then others but in general, as with most things, my love potion got better with time. But then I stopped making it.I am not sure why. Was it because I fell in love or because I grew up, got a real job? I don’t know. I just stopped and never really thought about it again until now.Organizing my bookshelf I came across the book I found many moons ago, at a wise womyn’s garage sale, with this simple recipe outlined below.

1 ounce dried damiana (Turnera diffusa) leaves1 pint vodka¾ pint spring water½ to 1 cup of honeyInfuse the damiana in the vodka for five days, and then strain through a coffee filter. Set aside the vodka tincture and put the leaves to soak in the water for another five days. Stain as before. Discard the leaves. Heat the water infusion just enough to dissolve the honey. Add the amount of honey according to how sweet you wish the cordial to be. When cool combine with the vodka.

I would take this cordial and combine it with a number of different ingredients. I started adding herbs to the damiana infusion. I experimented with time and the moon, scent and even the color of the final concoction.I took courses and read book on ethnobotany and learned more about our complex relationship with plants. I discovered that honeysuckle helps us get over old emotions. Basil can balance the Madonna–whore complex. Cardamom oil is considered magnetic to the opposite sex. Ginger has been used as an aphrodisiac in China for three thousand years and is known to sharpen the mind and soothe the emotions.Each year the potions grew in complexity but I never bothered to write down the ingredients from one year to the next. It evolved with me.Love seemed less complex in those days. I wonder how much that had to do with these love potions.

It's good news when an unexpected check comes in the mail, or when your kid comes home with improved grades. But GOOD NEWS is life-changing. Today I'd like to talk about the best news I ever received. Here it is:

There is forgiveness for my failings.There is grace for my faults.There is love I can't understand.

This was life-changing news for me, because at heart, I'm rotten. I'm selfish. I'm a liar. Even when I do good things, too often I do them to try to impress other people, or to try to prove to myself that I'm not that bad, even when I know deep down that I really am.

People talk about karma; karma scares me. I'll never be a good enough person to deserve what I want. This is why this really good news changed my life.

The GOOD NEWS is that God knows me, knows all about me - and that he loves me anyway. That he offers me forgiveness if I'll just accept it. And that he offers me grace every day, and the chance to really be achanged person.

God sent his son, Jesus, to earth for all of us. He lived a perfect life. He was the only person who karma really should've fully rewarded, and instead he died in my place, in your place. And then he didn't stay dead, but instead demonstrated the power to conquer death. One day he's going to come back to earth to set things right.

That's the best news I've ever received. It changed my life. It can change yours, too, if you'll believe it.

Time to finish: 4.5 hoursTime where you're actively working on the pizza: 1.5 hours

4.5 hours before you eat

Fill a medium bowl with the 2 cups of water, mix / disolve the yeast into the water. Add the olive oil, vegetable oil, cornmeal, and half the wheat flour. Beat for about 10 minutes. Add the potato flour, the remaining wheat flour, and the salt and pepper. Lightly grease a bowl at least twice as large as the dough, place dough in the bowl, and cover with damp cloth or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise for at least 3 hours. Punch down the dough at least 3 times over this time.

1.5 hours before

Put the pizza stone on the bottom rack of the oven and turn the oven to the max temperature.Prepare sauce / toppings.

1 hour before

Roll out dough to about 1/2 cm thick to fit in deepdish pizza pan. There will be leftover dough, put it in the freezer or cook another pizza. Lightly oil deepdish pizza pan and put dough in it.Add sauce / toppings.

30 min before

Lower the temperature to 450 F. Once it reaches 450, cook the pizza in the pan, on the stone, until the top is brown. Remove the pizza from the oven and get it off the pan and onto a rack by using a metal spatula to lift one crust of the pizza over the lip of the pan. With the stone still in the oven, increase the temperature to the max again. After the pizza has been on the rack for ~4 minutes, remove the stone from the oven and place the pizza onto the stone. After the pizza has been on the stone for ~5 minutes, remove from the stone, and its ready to eat!

Today I want to talk about a place very special to my heart: the country of Albania.

This is probably the point you groan with boredom; that's it? That's our email of the day? An informational on some little country?

As an Albanian-American who was born there and has returned several times to fall in love with the nation all over again, I am hoping I can dissuade any preconceived notions you might have. Albania is a small Eastern European country in the Balkans that is directly north of Greece. It has a long history of occupations (ex: Italy,  the Ottoman Turks, etc.) and as such has an interesting fusion of a culture that blends old and new.

But let's get right into the heart of this. I urge you to GO visit. Take the path less traveled, this is what you'll find:

-A light-hearted, generous people (the role of the guest is an *extremely* important concept in Albanian culture - you will be in good hands)-Pristine beaches with clear water on the Adriatic Sea (this will vary by location, but I am strongly encouraging you to go to Vlora for gorgeous beaches)-Extremely affordable shopping and hotels (..seriously.)-Good, simple Mediterranean food at alarmingly low prices (good bread + our own spin on cool tzatziki yogurt sauce + fresh salads, minimum. you especially need to try roast lamb here!)-A penchant for music and dance, be it folk or techno-Weddings galore. It's the Albanians' favorite excuse to celebrate and would be an unforgettable experience

And honestly? If there's even one year I advise you to uncover this gem of a place, it's now. 2012. It's the year of the Dragon. It's Albania's 100 year anniversary of independence. Et cetera et cetera. We're living in exciting times; go now.

Here's to good traveling, good food, and good people. Gezuar! Cheers!

May 2012,05,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/05/05/under-the-tree-where-its-safe/,"May 2012, 05",Under The Tree Where It's Safe,"The focal point of my elementary school's lobby was a big painting of two girls sitting under a lushly blossoming tree, looking down at what was either a book or a game or a picnic; my rememberance of those particular details is a bit fuzzy. But I remember the artwork, how its depiction of a pastoral spring day loomed over the hallway of the 1950s-issue school, and I also remember that it was in honor of two girls that had passed away. I'd thought, back when I saw it on a daily basis, that they had been killed in a car accident at some point before I'd reached school age.

Memory is a funny thing, though. It turned out that the two girls had actually died when I was in kindergarden, on a May day in 1981. This fact came up by accident on Saturday, when I was sitting in my parents' kitchen, the same one where I ate breakfast every day before trucking off to school and seeing that painting. My mother and I were talking about fear and Etan Patz, whose name had recently popped up in the news like a ghost from the beginning of that period in history where children were not just seen as the future but were seen as potential prey for media-created bogeyman with evil intentions -- baby-food poisoners, overly friendly bicycle-repair guys played by Gordon Jump, Satanist preschool teachers. ""That shook me to the core,"" she said. ""And then, those girls on Myers Avenue...""

I didn't know what she was talking about, but she filled me in -- don't you remember the painting, she asked me. I did, of course, and it turned out that it was painted in honor of the two girls, who had been brutally murdered, along with their mother, in the spring of 1981. The coroner, my mother noted, had never seen anything so brutal, so many stab wounds, such reckless disregard for another person'shumanity, let alone three of them. The crime shook our suburb, a grid-planned section of Long Island populated by so many who had left their outerborough upbringings for what they assumed would be a BetterLife, not just because of the trees and bigger houses but because of the illusion of safety, an idea that seemed ever more tenuous with the increasingly bad news emanating from televisions and newspapers but that could at least be achieved on a nuclear-families-in-it-together level. But it was one of those subtle earthquakes that only affects structures, one where the damage isn't fully revealed until many years later. The parents kept a brave face and cloaked the most gruesome details -- or at least, mine did, judging by how shocked I was on Saturday morning, hearing this awful, 31-year-old news as the sunlight beamed into the kitchen where my mother had probably first learned of this tragedy all those years ago.

That night I got home and started pulling up accounts of the crime; the first few I found were wire mentions of the perpetrator being caugh. And then this, from the New York Times, May 2, 1981:

""It was Donald Williams Jr. who several hours earlier had reported to the police that he had been attacked on Myers Avenue at 4 A.M. as he was returning home from a night out. He described his assailant as a young black man with medium build, who he said had come out of the darkness, stabbed him in both hands and the chest and then quickly fled.""

Ah, the ""young black man."" You might not be surprised to find out that it was actually Williams, the family's across-the street neighbor, who committed the crime, a fact that the police figured out quickly (he was indicted less than a week later). That he floated a story that played into the prejuidices of the people who would be investigating and thinking about the crime probably isn't surprising, although it is depressing. But then again, doesn't fear play on those thoughts that lurk in peoples' brains -- especially those that are the ugliest to reveal outside of the context of a narrative that will support them?

Popular recollections of the 1980s might involve dayglo and stockbrokers, but for me, so much of that decade's narrative is wrapped up in the concept of being afraid. Some of it was personal: I was sickly when I was young; I was nerdy when I was older. But the milk cartons and movies of the week and the examinations of Halloween candy and so many other things created an atmosphere that taught children to look not just before they leapt, but before they even took the most miniscule step toward another person. It's something I'm still trying to shake off today, and when I read so many of the recollections of my peers about topics of all sorts, I wonder how many of them are still, in the depths of their minds, preyed upon by the vague memories of tales about people who are out to do nothing but cause them harm.

Just be you. It's the most amazing gift you can give to yourself, to me, to everyone in your world, and everyone in the world.

It's easier for some people than it is for others. If it's hard for you, make it your life's work to search for and find your authentic self. There is nothing more urgent.

Take full responsibility for your thoughts, behaviors, actions, the consequences of those actions, and the impact you have on people around you.

Be grateful. Appreciate and love what you have and what's working.

Seek clarity. Figure out what you like, what you want, and what's important to you.

Make decisions based on what's aligned with your values and what you're passionate about.

Learn to let go of the things/people/thoughts that don't serve you or steer you toward happiness and fulfillment.

If you know what's important to you, it's easier to know why you are doing things and what things you should be doing. Don't waste time doing things that are not related to what's important to you.

Dare to be emotionally accessible, vulnerable, and to expand your emotional range. Go for depth, richness, and honesty. It's raw, it's terrifying, and it's exhilarating.

Whatever you are, whoever you are, and whatever it is that you're all about - OWN IT.

Be unapologetically you. Know what you're about and pursue your dreams with an open heart and genuine passion. If someone doesn't like it, that's fine. But it's not your problem.

Seek resonance. This is where the magic happens. Don't fear it. Embrace it.

Be alive. Be real. Be you.

May 2012,01,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/05/01/setbacks/,"May 2012, 01",Setbacks,"In 2006, I worked as a business journalist and did fun things like flying around the world to interview executives and reporting about what really rich people do with their money.  I had a 9-to-5 job and an awesome salary. Three years later, the financial crisis hit and I, along with thousands of other people, was out of a job.  So, for the first few days of my unemployment, I did what any other right-minded woman would do: I went to all of the sample sales that were happening during the daytime in New York and bought a lot of shoes. Eventually, my dwindling bank account forced me to open up my laptop and scour the Internet for jobs.

There’s no activity more disheartening than searching for jobs. Except watching an episode of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” while you’re out of a job, which I did, and it sucked. I applied for 23 jobs, and after each rejection, I spiraled down a path of self-doubt, uncertainty and depression.  I had no direction in life. I felt like I was underwater, and I didn’t know which way was up.

In my misery, I started to try new things. I learned how to cook.  I took up tango dancing.  I read Harry Potter in Spanish.  I bought a harmonica so I could sing away my blues.

I dared to try all of these things that I never had the courage to do before. But my biggest dare by far was to abandon the job search and apply to art school, to a program called ITP. Never in a million years did I think I would apply to art school.  But the next two years were the most fun, the most challenging and the most rewarding times of my life.  I learned how to program phone apps, make robots, create art and do things that I never thought I was capable of doing.

When I lost my job, I was poor, eating cliff bars for meals and collecting free samples of eye cream from Sephora. Today, I am still poor, eating cliff bars for meals and collecting free samples of eye cream from Sephora.  What’s different, however, is my preconceived notion of my career path and who I am.  Hitting rock bottom was the catalyst for me to reinvent myself and try things I never thought I could do.  Like, I used to want to be a journalist.  Now, I want to be a NBA basketball player. ;p

So, we will all undoubtedly hit many setbacks in our life. But embrace them because it’s a good kick-in-the-pants to try something new. Your “failures” could turn out to be the best experiences of your life.

April 2012,30,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/04/30/some-thoughts/,"April 2012, 30",Some thoughts,"Hello!

These are some things I've learned which guide the way I think, and which I value most. I hope they are the most valuable things I can offer to you. Of course, they come entirely from others, who I've paraphrased or quoted below. (I'll reference at the bottom.)

There is more advice and knowledge than I can ever consume. Most of it is probably good and useful to some extent. Hence, choice and prioritization are even more important.

The way something is presented is often more important than its content. The most important part of the way something is presented is how long it takes someone to consume it.

Time is the most important thing I have: ""it has been said that time is money. That proverb understates the case. Time is a great deal more than money. If you have time you can obtain money--usually. But though you have the wealth of a cloak-room attendant at the Carlton Hotel, you cannot buy yourself a minute more time than I have, or the cat by the fire has"" (Bennett).

I’ll spend maybe a third of my life sleeping. Traditionally, another third working, but: ""there’s a common misconception that work is necessary. You will meet people working at miserable jobs. They tell you they are 'making a living'. No, they’re not. They’re dying, frittering away their fast-extinguishing lives doing things which are, at best, meaningless and, at worst, harmful. People will tell you that work ennobles you, that work lends you a certain dignity. Work makes you free. The slogan “Arbeit macht frei” was placed at the entrances to a number of Nazi concentration camps. Utter nonsense. Do not waste the vast majority of your life doing something you hate so that you can spend the small remainder sliver of your life in modest comfort. You may never reach that end anyway"" (Tan).

I try to guide what I do by this simple dictum: to do everything I do with intention. If one is happy to be average, it will happen. Being average is the default. Create, rather than consume. Consume with intention: don't watch TV, watch a show.

Last, I try to be mindful. What I mean by that is to be active in choosing what I think about, and to fight the defaults. Which is to say, for me, to be ego-centric. I like this mind-game from David Foster Wallace: ""there are totally different ways to think about these [miserable, tedious] kinds of situations... [perhaps] the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he's trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he's in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way. Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket's checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do."" But the point is not so much what you should think, rather that you get to choose what to think, and especially that you can choose to be happy. Strive to be happy.

I've had to say goodbye more times than I would have liked.But I guess everyone can say that.I'm not talking about the see you later goodbye or the goodbye we automatically address to a waiter. I refer to THE goodbye. The one that tears up our throat and make our eyes go all wetty when we say it. We all know it. No matter what the circumstance is.

This goodbye is usually said to people who really matter to us and it for instance occurs when we are moving far enough from them that they won't be as easily reachable as they were. What makes this moment difficult is that we are aware that not only we're saying goodbye to a person, we're saying goodbye to a relationship. Deep down we know that this bond won't be the same anymore. It may progressively vanished as the time goes by or get stronger. It merely depends on individuals.But when we say goodbye we don't know how things will be and it's confusing. It feels like a chapter of our life is done and somehow we are scared of the upcoming one. It's the unknown part of our future that spook us.

The thing is, no matter how many times we do it, even when it's for the greater good, it still stinks. It really does. And though we will never forget what we've given up, we owe it to ourselves to keep moving forward. What we can't do, is live our lives always afraid of the next goodbye, because chances are, they're not going to stop.

The trick is to recognize when a goodbye can be a good thing, when it's a chance to start again, a chance to discover new things, to meet new people. 

Helloes.

And when meeting someone for the first time, the adage wants the conversation to start with ""Hello!"".When we think about it, this word is the nicest thing someone can say to a perfect stranger. We could perfectly say what we want to say without saying ""Hello"". We don't need it to make our speech understandable. But still we say it. And for what other reason than expecting a nice and courteous conversation with someone.  

Hint: Add a smile! It's painless and makes everything just brighter.

Anyway, just think that this little word ""Hello"" can be the first stone set to the foundation of a great relationship. We are probably missing great relationship with great people just by not talking to them. Sometimes we just hold back and get shy to talk to someone we think is interesting and worth knowing. We should just jump and do what we really want to do. What is it that's holding us back? If it's not literally a 200 pounds ball chained to our feet then we have no excuses.

There is beauty in the world and guess what humans being are part of this beauty. So say Hello to it as much as you can. Goodbyes are part of life. If they hurt it just means that the first Hello involved was a blessing.

April 2012,28,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/04/28/patrick-of-ireland/,"April 2012, 28",Patrick of Ireland,"Once upon a time — and listen, for although this sounds like a fable, I will try to make every word true — once upon a time there was a young boy named Patrick, a young Christian boy whose father was a deacon, and whose grandfather was a priest. Patrick, though he was raised in a Christian household did not himself know God. I imagine he was like most people, just living his life out without much concern for spiritual things.

But then something really terrible happened. Raiders attacked his parents’ villa, and Patrick was taken off to be a slave in Ireland. I suspect that his parents had plans for him to go off to the city to become an educated gentleman. Instead, he was taken off at age sixteen to become a slave. Instead of going to school, he was forced to become a shepherd.

In his loneliness and emptiness, he began to remember what he knew about God. And he started to pray the prayers he had been taught; I don’t know what prayers, but I imagine he prayed the “Our Father.” He started praying more and more — in the fields at night and during the day, even waking up before daylight to pray, praying up to, he says, 100 prayers in a day. God started to burn in him.

He was a slave until he was about twenty, and then something very spooky but real happened. He was sleeping, but he heard a voice saying he was going home soon. Soon after he heard the voice again saying that his boat was ready. He immediately fled from his slave-owner, for he recognized that this was a message directly from God. He had to travel 200 miles to get to the harbor where the ship was, in a land he did not know, among people whom he did not know.

He found the ship, and they almost didn’t take him. After the visions and after walking 200 miles, I imagine he was disappointed. He headed back to the hut where he was staying praying along the way. As he was walking and praying, one of the men shouted at him to come back; he could get a ride with them.

They traveled for three days before they landed, and then the whole group started walking — after twenty-eight days, their food ran out, and it was uninhabited. His companions were kind to have taken him in, but now they were hungry and cranky, and began to taunt him about God, asking that perennial question: If God is so great and powerful, why isn’t God helping us?

Patrick had good reason to trust that God had something other than starving in mind for them, though, and he told them boldly that they should become Christians. He also said that God was going to provide so much food that very day that they couldn’t eat any more. And so it happened: a herd of pigs came by, and I imagine they had a pretty good pork barbecue. Their attitude towards God and Patrick changed that day; in fact, they had fire and food enough for the rest of their journey.

Patrick eventually was able to return to his kinsfolk, and he was glad to return, and they were glad to have him. But Patrick had another dream: a man named Victorius bringing letters from Ireland, and in his dream he read one of the letters. The letter said it was “The Voice of the Irish,” and he could hear the voices of people he knew in Ireland begging him to return to return to the land of his slavery.

So Patrick returned to Ireland to preach. He didn’t cast out the snakes; we don’t know if he used a shamrock to teach the Trinity; the hymns attributed to him are most likely not by him. But we know he continued to face hardship. In fact, he was kidnapped at least one more time for two months. Patrick’s life was full of ups and downs, He was ashamed of his poor education (poor man, he only knew three or so languages and wrote his confession in Latin that was perhaps not up to par). He called himself a stutterer, though he preached to thousands. He felt that “poverty and failure suited him better than wealth and delight.” He certainly never got wealthy ministering to the Irish. He remained homesick, I think, to the end of his days. But he recognized the work of God through him, but he felt bound by the Spirit to remain in Ireland.

April 2012,27,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/04/27/tiny-wings/,"April 2012, 27",Tiny wings,"Hi all,

I want to write about a subject that is very close to my heart - bees! I started bee keeping last year, and have two colonies right now. These two already managed to supply my family and my friends with more than enough honey, and keeping the bees is a tremendously satisfying activity. They smell so good, and are very tidy animals, and are just very, very interesting overall. The insects' way of dealing with the world is just so very different from how we as mammals approach it - it seems almost alien.

Anyways, what is probably most impressive is the workload these little animals deal with. For one kilo of honey, they visit 4 million flowers, and fly a distance equivalent of more than 4 times around the earth. Think about that for a second.

And then, if you start to think about how they ""furniture"" their housing themselves by the wax they sweat out, how they can control temperature inside the hive to the tenth of a degree, how they collectively make decisions in a group of 50'000 (the queen has nothing to say in that sense, she is only the breeding unit)… the amazement never stops.

Anyhows, next time you complain about how tough your life is - have a spoon of honey and think of the bees. And start to keep some! (You can also do it in the city - no excuses!)

That is all :) Best wishes,

It's one of my favorite things to do! Along the way, I've come up with a few things that seem to apply to every type of business.

If you're thinking about starting a business, or in the beginning stages, here are a few tips to help you start your venture.

1) Decide what your goals are, and how hard you want to work. There's a big difference between a plan that ends with you making a comfortable living vs. one with a $100M payout. Decide what route is right for you. 

2) Do something you're truly passionate about. If it doesn't sound like an exciting adventure, to you, from the beginning, keep looking for the right opportunity. Starting a new business can be a rough road, and requires a certain level of belief and momentum to keep going. If you're not into it, it's hard to keep it going during the hard times.

3) Build a 3-year plan. Sit down with a financial spreadsheet and build a model for your business that takes into account expenses and revenue as you grow for 3 years. If you haven't done this before, get a help! This will tell you whether your idea is a viable business or not. 

4) Have customers lined up before you begin. If you can't convince at least a handful of people to agree to try out and ultimately pay for your product and service once it's ready, then you should really think about whether it will work. Too many companies have failed because the founders put their sweat, blood and tears into something no one wanted. 

5) Start. A major key to success with a new business is prioritizing. If you're doing it right, there will always be more to do then you can accomplish. The hardest part is deciding what NOT to do while making steady progress.

Hope that helps someone get started!

I just got the first Listserve email, and it was a little bit too similar to what I was originally going to send so I deleted my email and started again. I feel as though this is going to turn into a mass swapping of inspirational quotes for us to all live our lives by…but hopefully it will vary more as time goes on.

I’m going to just share some secrets with you instead.

1.      When no one is watching, I like to dance as if I’m in a hip hop music video.

2.      I haven’t washed my hair for four days. Dry shampoo is one of my favourite inventions.

3.      I’ve always wanted to break my arm or leg. I don’t want to really go through the pain, just ever since I was younger I’ve been jealous of the slings and crutches involved.

4.      I like Justin Bieber’s new song… I don’t want to and it pains me to say it, but I think I do.

5. I GENUINELY (and irrationally) believe I’m going to win the jackpot on the Euromillions Lottery one day. I know people always have the conversation about what they would buy if they won the lottery, speaking hypothetically, but in my head I’m thinking.. “great idea, you need to remember that for when you win”. Having my email picked from this list just made me even more sure of it. Ridiculous, I know.

Have a lovely day!

No money, no place to live, just a bunch of friends who helped me out of the streets and put me back on my feet.

Ending up in such a pit you first feel anger, then sorrow, then you make fun of it because that is the only way to make it bearable, and then you can go forward. It took me three more years to be able to shop for food without having to count change in my pockets.

Twenty years later I gave the books away but I still keep the old bag as a memory and my guitar is now standing in the living-room where I occasionally use it to sing for my kids.

Life has been a tough ride so far, but at least I know how to live without being bothered by simple objects. I know the only things you can count on are:- What is inside you: your skills, your knowledge- Good friends, and other people you love

Be generous and help somebody today get out of poverty. We all deserve a future.

April 2012,22,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/04/22/volatile-software/,"April 2012, 22",Volatile Software,"I want to use my fifteen minutes of fame on The Listserve to rant aboutsomething that's close to my heart: the stability of the software I use.

NOTE: This is written for people who create software.  If you don't do that youprobably won't find this very interesting.  Sorry!  Maybe you could read Textfrom Dog if you haven't seen it already?  Either way, have a nicemorning/afternoon/evening!

The Situation-------------

Every time I get a new computer, I go through the same song and dance:

1. Look at what programs and packages I have installed on the old computer.2. Install these programs on the new computer.3. Copy over my configuration files from the old computer to the new one.4. Spend the rest of my day fixing all the things that broke because I'm using    a newer version of program X.

Step 4 is always the most painful part of getting a new machine.  Always.

Without fail I spend several hours tweaking configuration files, adjusting myworkflow, and so on because I've upgraded to a new version of foo which doesn'tsupport option X any more or requires library Y version N+1 now.

Getting a new computer should be a *pleasant* experience!  The unboxing from thesleek packaging, that ""new laptop"" smell, the nostalgia of the default desktopimage.  Why does this horrible step 4 have to exist and how can we get rid ofit?

The Divide----------

I've noticed something interesting lately: I can categorize almost *all* of thesoftware I use into two distinct groups:

* Software that breaks pretty much *every* time I update it (e.g. weechat,  offlineimap, Clojure, many Python packages, Skype).* Software that almost *never* breaks when I update it (e.g. Mercurial, git,  tmux, Python, ack, zsh, Vim, Dropbox).

Software that falls in between these two extremes is surprisingly rare.  Thereseems to be a pretty clean divide between the two groups.

This makes me think that there's some special attribute or quality of thesecond group (or its authors) which the first one lacks.

Brokenness----------

I think it's important that I nail down what I mean by ""breaks"" or ""is broken"".I don't necessarily just mean the introduction of ""new bugs"".

When I say that a program ""breaks"", I mean:

* When I update from version X to version Y of a program, library, or language...* Without changing my configuration files, source code, etc...* The resulting combination doesn't work properly

In effect, I'm saying that ""breaking backwards compatibility"" means ""the programis broken""!

This may be a strong statement, but I stand by it in most cases.

Backwards compatibility matters!  Every time someone makes a backwardsincompatible change in a program or library, they cost the world the followingamount of time:

    Number of people          Time it takes each person    using that part of      X    to figure out what changed    the program                   and how to fix it Often this can be a significant amount of time!

The Process of Updating-----------------------

When pointing out a backwards incompatible change to someone, you'll often geta response similar to this:

    ""Well, I mentioned that backwards incompatibility in the changelog, so what    the hell, man!""

This is not a satisfactory answer.

When I'm updating a piece of software there's a good chance it's not because I'mspecifically updating *that program*.  I might be:

* Moving to a new computer.* Running a ""$PACKAGE_MANAGER update"" command.* Moving a website to a bigger VPS and reinstalling all the libraries.

In those cases (and many others) I'm not reading the release notes fora specific program or library.  I'm not going to find out about the brokennessuntil I try to use the program the next time.

If I'm lucky the program will have a ""this feature is now deprecated, read thedocs"" error message.  That's still a pain, but at least it's less confusing thanjust getting a traceback, or worst of all: silently changing the behavior ofa feature.

Progress--------

I completely understand that when moving *backwards* to an older versionI should expect problems.  The older version hasn't had the benefit of the extrawork done on the new version, so of course it should be less stable.

But when I'm *updating* to a higher version number the software should be*better* and *more stable*!  It has had more work done on it, and I assume noone is actively trying to make software worse, so why does something thatpreviously worked no longer work?

We're supposed to be making *progress* as we move forward.  The software has had*more* work done on it, why does it not function correctly *now* when itfunctioned correctly *before*?

Yes, this means developers will need to add extra code to handle oldinput/configuration.  Yes, this is a pain in the ass, but *the entire point ofmost software is to save people time by automating things*.  Again, everybackwards-incompatible change costs the world an amount of time:

    Number of people         Time it takes each person    using that part of     X      to figure out what changed    the program                  and how to fix it

If our goal is to *save time* then we should not make changes that *cost time*.Or at least we should not make such changes lightly.

A Culture of Sadness--------------------

Proof that this is a real issue can be found in the tools we use every day.  Asprogrammers we've invented elaborate dependency systems to deal with it.

We say ""pip install django==1.3"" or put ""[clojure ""1.2""]"" in our Leiningenproject.clj files to avoid using the newest versions because they'll break.

Step back and look at this for a second.

What the hell?

What the *hell*?

We have invented software with features designed to help us use *old* versionsof other software!

We have *written code* to *avoid* using the ""latest and greatest"" software!

Obviously this is not entirely bad, but the fact that manually specifyingversion numbers to avoid running *newer* code is commonplace, expected, anda ""best practice"" horrifies me.

I would *love* to be able to say something like this in my requirements.txt andproject.clj files:

    Of *course* I want the latest version of library X!  I want *all* the    newest bug fixes and improvements!

Unfortunately I can't do that right now because so many projects make backwardsincompatible changes all the time.

The moment I try to build the project at some point in the future I'll be senton a wild goose chase to figure out what function moved into what othernamespace and what other function was split into its own library and dammit thedocumentation on the project's website is autogenerated from the tip of its gitrepo and so it doesn't apply to the latest actual version and jesus christI think I'll just quit programming and teach dance full time instead even thoughI'll go hungry.

The Tradeoff------------

One could argue that sometimes backwards incompatible changes cost time up frontbut save time in the long run by making the software more ""elegant"" and ""lean"".

While I'm sure there are cases where this is true, I feel like it's a cop outmost of the time.  Allow me to illustrate this with a helpful Venn diagram:

                                    -------                                   /3333333\                                  |333333333|                                   \3333333/                                    -------

    11 -> People who give a shit what a program's codebase    11    looks like.

    22 -> The authors of said program.    22

For libraries where the author is the only user, none of this rant applies.You're free!  Break as much as you like!

For the majority of libraries, however, there are probably vastly more ""users""than ""authors"".  Saving a few hours of the authors' own time has to be weighedagainst the 10 minutes each that the hundreds of users will have to spendfiguring out what happened and working around it.

I want to be clear: being backwards compatible *doesn't* mean sacrificing newfeatures!  New features can still be added!  Refactoring can still happen!

In most cases keeping backwards compatibility simply means maintaining a bit ofwrapper code to support people using the previous version.

For example: in Python, if we moved the public foo() function to a new module,we'd put the following line in the original module:

    from newmodule import new_foo as foo

Is it pretty?  Hell no!  But this single line of code will probably save morepeople more time than most of the other lines in the project!

This may just be an artifact of how my brain is wired, but I actually geta sense of satisfaction from writing code that bridges the gap between olderversions and new.

I can almost hear a little voice in my head saying:

    ""Mwahaha, I'll slip this refactoring past them and they'll never even know    it happened!""

Maybe it's just me, but I think that ""glue"" code can be clever and beautiful inits own right.

It may not bring a smile to anyone's face like a shiny new feature, but itprevents many frowns instead, and preventing a frown makes the world a happierplace just as much as creating a smile!

Exceptions----------

One case where I feel the backwards incompatibility tradeoff *is* worth it issecurity.

A good example of this is Django's change which made AJAX requests no longer beexempt from CSRF checks.  It was backwards incompatible and I'm sure it brokesome people's projects, but I think it was the right thing to do because itimproved security.

I also think it's unreasonable to expect all software to be perfectly ready fromits first day.

Sometimes software needs to get poked and prodded in the real world before it'sfully baked, and until then requiring strict backwards compatibility will domore harm than good.

By all means, backwards compatibility should be thrown to the wind in the firststage of a project's life.  At the beginning it needs to find its legs, likea baby gazelle on the Serengeti.  But at some point the project needs to get itsbalance, grow up, and start concerning itself with backwards compatibility.

But when should that happen?

A Solution----------

I think there's a simple, intuitive way to mark the transition of a piece ofsoftware from ""volatile"" to ""stable"":

    Version 1.0

Before version 1, software can change and evolve rapidly with no regards forbreaking, but once that first number becomes ""greater than or equal to 1"" it'stime to be a responsible member of the software community and start thinkingabout the real humans whose time gets wasted for every breaking change.

This is the approach semantic versioning takes, and I think it's the right one.

I know a lot of people dislike semantic versioning.  They hate how requiresincrementing the major version number every time a breaking change is made.

I consider it to be a *good* thing.

You *should* pause and carefully consider making a change that will breakpeople's current code.

You *should* be ashamed if your project is at version 43.0.0 because you've made42 breaking changes.  That's 43 times you've disregarded your users' time!That's a bad thing!

As programmers we need to start caring about the people we write software for.

Before making a change that's going to cause other people pain, we should askourselves if it's really worth the cost.  Sometimes it is, but many times it'snot, and we can wrap the change up so it doesn't hurt anyone.

So please, before you make that backwards incompatible change, think of theother human beings who are going to smack their monitors when your softwarebreaks.

April 2012,21,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/04/21/blossom/,"April 2012, 21",Blossom,"      She was sick of it all.  Sick of the contradictions, sick of the distance, and most of all, sick of the silence that ricocheted back and forth across her ear drums, more deafening than a collapsing building.  Polite conversation, with its one-worded banter laced in falsity, could be tolerated.  But the silence between them was painful.  She wondered what had happened to their relationship.  At one point they had been much more than just roommates; they had been best friends.  They knew things about each other that no one else knew, and they shared secrets that ranged from romance to regrets, from insecurities to ideologies.  Their close friendship had helped make the transition from small towns to college life easier for the both of them.  Although they had differing personalities, they seemed to complement each other.  But, most importantly, they had trusted each other.  Recently, all of that had disappeared without warning.

      When it was time to leave, she didn’t say that she was heading to class.  She didn’t want to interrupt the silence, an invisible yet unforgivable barrier that had formed between them.  She didn’t owe an explanation for her departure, and she knew she wouldn’t have received a response anyway.  Besides, she was sick of trying.  She forced her work into a tattered backpack, stuffing notebooks filled with messy, looping handwriting and elaborate margin doodles in between a handful of novels and a laptop.  Hoisting the bag over her shoulder, she pulled a battered iPod out of her pocket, inserted the small headphones into her ears, and pressed play.  She breathed a sigh of relief.  Though it was temporary, her music allowed her to escape from the silence that smothered her.

      Her class started at 2 o’clock, but her dorm was a good distance away from the English building, so she left at exactly 1:30.  She decided to take a bus halfway and then walk the remainder, allowing her to be one of the first to class but still giving her the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful sunny day.  The afternoon temperature was unusually warm, and the day seemed to belong in May instead of February.  This unexpected heat wave baffled the local weathermen, but it thrilled the students.  As she stood at the bus stop, she noticed a few tan, bikini-clad girls were lounging on beach towels outside of her dorm.  Several drivers stared at them as they drove by.  The bus pulled up next to her, and she felt a familiar rush of warm air graze her cheek.  She realized she was sweating.  She greeted the bus driver, courteously taking her headphones out of her ears and making eye-contact.  An old man with a beard smiled at her, and she smiled back and sat next to him.  She fiddled with her iPod, which she had put on Shuffle mode, listening to each song for about five seconds until she changed it, briefly moving from soft jazz to classic rock to hip hop in a rhythmic pace.  Her musical taste was eclectic, to say the least, much like her personality.  She refused to associate with one particular stereotype.  Instead, she dabbled in each one with no notions of stylistic identity, wearing what she liked and listening to what she wanted.  Each song, no matter its genre, represented something to her.  Sometimes it reminded her of an old friend or a past memory, while other times the bass line just seemed to reflect her mood.  She let her emotions choose the song, letting her thumb repeatedly press the “next” button while she stared out the window.  Finally, she settled on a fast-paced, top-40 track that reminded her of high school, a track that she used to listen to with her friends while they drove around town with the stereo turned up and the windows rolled down.  It was a track of innocent love, something she had once experienced.  She had forgotten how it felt, but after the first few lines she could feel her heart beating along to the familiar melody of the chords.  She thought back to that time and briefly admired how much simpler life had been then.

      The song abruptly changed to one with repetitious bass pounding and loud, heavy guitar riffs.  She quickly forgot of her past, as the nostalgia of blissful immaturity faded away, immediately replaced with the new track’s rapid lyrics. She silently tapped her foot to the pulsating beat.

      The driver lurched to a stop just as a guitar screeched in her ears, and she held on to the pole next to her to prevent herself from being thrown forward.  She grabbed her bag, squeezed out from the area that encased her tiny seat, and carefully stepped off the bus onto the pavement and headed toward class.  She walked slowly, admiring the way the bright sun shone through the naked trees, trees that weren’t ready to bloom and probably wouldn’t be ready for a few months, if that.  The winter had been abnormally harsh that year, and it was predicted that the trees would probably bloom later than normal as a result.  The vivid, recent image of the trees covered in snow sprang into her mind, and she realized a week ago, she had to wear a winter coat and gloves while walking to class.  Now, it was forty degrees warmer and anyone wearing a coat would be scalding.

      She briefly glanced at the people she passed by.  Class had just gotten out, so the pathways were crowded.  Several groups of rowdy boys walked past, describing their drunken hook-ups from the previous weekend and rambunctiously slapping each other on the back.  They were all dressed similarly, wearing khaki shorts and pastel-colored polo shirts, their dark hair sticking out from underneath backward baseball caps.  They were tall and handsome, and they all seemed to have similar features.  Their collective good-looks repulsed her.  There was no variety; they were all the same.  Next to them walked large packs of girls, most of them blond and tan with thin, dainty physiques.  Some of them wore brightly colored sundresses.  Others wore tennis shoes and running shorts, though their neatly combed back hair and flawlessly applied make-up gave no indication of exercise.  They were all beautiful, but they blended together, no one face standing out amongst the others.  In the beginning of the school year, she had envied their apparent mass perfection.  She began dressing up to go to class and started wearing makeup.  Though she rarely wore earrings, she began to stick pearls into her ears every day, regardless of her outfit.  She even abandoned her tomboyish wardrobe and occasionally wore dresses or skirts.  But, soon enough, she got sick of it.  She grew sick of waking up early every morning to straighten her hair, to put together a perfectly matching outfit.  She grew sick of pretending to be someone she was not just to fit into a crowd of people that she did not resemble in the slightest.  Instead, she forced herself apart from her classmates.  She gradually got used to the fraternity boys looking right through her, as if she didn’t exist, and to the girls in class talking to each other but not to her.  She watched them converse as they walked past, but her music pounded in her ears, preventing her from hearing them.  As she walked, she noticed that she was the only one wearing jeans.

      She looked down at her iPod as she approached the building, checking the time.  About ten minutes early.  Not too bad.  She systematically entered the building, walked down three flights of stairs, took a left, then a right, then a left again.  Before entering, she turned off her music, wrapped up the headphones carefully, and put the iPod into her pocket.  Then she entered, just like always.  The only difference was that, this time, she was standing in a room of emptiness.  The light was off, and the lack of windows made her feel as if she were standing in a cave instead of a classroom.  It was completely silent, apart from the humming of a computer that sat in the corner, its screensaver a series of random twists and turns that filled the screen with color.  This computer was the only source of light, and the screensaver’s colors faintly shined across the room onto the wall.  A technological rainbow.  She was mildly surprised at the unexpected abyss she was standing in.  Even though she was ten minutes early, she was never the first one to class.  She felt as if she were trespassing, even though she was in the right place.  She watched as the computer went into sleep mode, the screen blackening like the room around her.

      She considered waiting outside in the hallway for someone else to arrive, but she decided to turn on the light switch next to the door instead.  She went and sat down in her usual seat.  The song she had just been listening to was repeating itself inside of her head; she quietly hummed and tapped her foot to the rhythm.  Out of boredom, she pulled out one of her worn notebooks, its pages nearly filled up even though the semester had only started a month or two ago, and finished a doodle she had drawn of a man that had popped into her head but probably didn’t actually exist.  She shaded his cheekbones with a stubby pencil, drew then erased then redrew his thick eyebrows, and lightly added eyelashes to his bright, wide eyes that seemed to be staring directly at her.  His lips were turned slightly upward in a mischievous half grin, as if he knew something about her that no one else did.  Once she was satisfied with her finished sketch, she awoke from her artistic trance and realized that she was still alone.  She turned on her iPod and glanced at the clock.  3:02.

      Confused and suddenly worried that she was in the wrong room, she opened the door and looked at the room number.  It was then that she noticed the blue post-it on the door.  “No class today.  Office hours will be held as usual tomorrow.  Sorry for any inconvenience.”  While most students would probably celebrate this cancelation, she felt empty, as empty as the room she was standing in.  Instead of the interaction she longed for, even if it was forced, she was once again thrust into an abnormal solitude.

      She walked down the hallway and joined the throng of people walking home.  Although she was submersed by the crowd, she still seemed to be set apart from them somehow.  She turned on her iPod and inserted her headphones to escape from the nothingness that surrounded her.  Here, she was the queen of her own world, a world with only one citizen.  Her world made sense; it was one of sound and song.  The bass drum of her heartbeat set the 4/4 rhythm and her footsteps pounded along in harmonized reverberation.  This beat was steady and calming, unlike the confusion that she felt as she glanced at the people that passed her by. She watched the crowd around her as their lips moved, almost synchronized, but no sound came out.  Concentrating intently on the rhythm that surrounded her, she looked ahead at the trees in the distance.  The sun brightened their bare, crooked limbs, and though it was still early in the year, she saw what looked to be a single white blossom slowly emerging to greet the unfamiliar sun.  Her smile bloomed.

April 2012,20,https://thelistservearchive.com//2012/04/20/be-a-diva/,"April 2012, 20",Be a Diva,"As my friends (and acquaintances) will attest, one thing that I’m an expert at is preaching about Diva Cups. Male readers and squeamish ladies, this might get a little rough, but stick with me for a moment because this is important.

Most ladies have grown up knowing that there are two ways to deal with periods: pads and tampons. The “feminine hygiene” aisle at most stores reinforces this, and each month we drop up to $30 on an assortment of items with wings and strings to be strategically packed into hidden pockets of purses. There is a better way...Diva Cups (my brand of choice, but there’s also The Keeper, Moon Cup, and other brands) are a complete game changer. Buy it once for about $35, and use it for 10 years. You can leave it in for up to 12 hours, and it will hold quite a lot (even for those of us who are blessed with ‘extra super plus’ volumes of fun each month). Rinse it out in the sink, pop it back in, and you are good to go.

Think it’s too gross? Nope. You can handle it. And if you can’t, just do it while squinting and saying, “Ew, ew, ew, ew.” The actual amount of liquid involved in all of this turns out to be less than you might expect, once you see it in a little cup.

Ever have one of those times where you choose a tampon that’s a little too intense for your particular situation that day and it doesn’t feel quite right? Never happens with the Diva Cup. One size fits all of your flows, and you don’t have to worry about packing up your bag with five different products just in case. Diva Cups have also never been tied to toxic shock syndrome.

I recently read that we each throw away 7 pounds of trash per day, so this is one small way to decrease your waste.

The package comes with a flower pin that says “Diva” in pink on it, too, which you can wear to flaunt your menstrual strategy anywhere from business meetings to school dances. Or you can leave it at home, like I do.

Since people only need to buy this product once every 10 years, the manufacturers don’t have the same marketing budgets as the tampon companies, and many people have never heard of menstrual cups before. So in short, please spread the word. Buy it for yourself, buy it for your sister, buy it for your wife. It works better, it’s cheaper, and it’s better for the environment--It’s really so awesome, and available at Whole Foods and other fine crunchy stores.

Thanks and good luck!

I'm not joking. The adventures you'll tell your children about will be a minuscule part of it. So if you want to avoid the feeling of utter disappointment as you grow older, you need to accept that fact. Sorry.

This leads us to the insight: You should focus more on the non-fantastic parts. The parts where you eat breakfast, walk to the bus, have a boring day at work, eat your ordinary lunch, shop groceries, and brush your teeth. After all, this is the major part of your life, and neglecting it is a wasted opportunity.

Here's the thing: Most of the boring stuff in your life is so dull, that even the tiniest thing can make it seem fun. The tiniest thing. This means the you could make it better with extremely simple means.

What exactly am I talking about here? Little things. Like these:

* Challenges: When brushing your teeth tonight, use your left hand.* Mind games: When you enter work (or school!), imagine the sound ""Kabaaaam!"" as you enter, as if your presence changed the whole room.* Action: Jump down from the side-walk, instead of just stepping down.* Changes: Buy some fancy tomato sauce tonight, instead of your usual brand.* More action: Count the number of pink things on your way to work, as if your life depended on it.

See? Easy stuff. I really try to live by this ""Everyday Action"" idea, and I think it works for making the boring parts of life more fun. Because that's the thing: just because the fantastic moments are few, there's no reason to just sit there, waiting for the next big thing to swipe you off your feet. Have some fun meanwhile, it's easy...
